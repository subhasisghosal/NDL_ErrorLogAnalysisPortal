Representing such problems for solution on the computer, however, remains a rather cumbersome task. Taking advantage of developments in high-level modeling languages, we design and implement integrated systems to facilitate the representation and solution of network problems. Such systems integrate the flexibility and robustness of modeling languages with the efficiency of network optimizers.We describe two alternative modes for this integration, which can be achieved for linear and nonlinear problems alike. The use of the resulting systems is demonstrated with the solution of large-scale problems from diverse applications and with the implementation of network decomposition algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18643","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18643","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18644","fieldValue":" A system of nonlinear equations has been used as a test case by at least two authors. This system is purported to describe the equilibrium of the products of hydrocarbon combustion. The given system does not describe the stated physical problem, a fact which invalidates it as a test of solution methods for chemical equilibrium systems. In this note, the problem is correctly stated and then solved by the method of element variables."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18644","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18644","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18645","fieldValue":" We present a portable software package for finding all real roots of a system of nonlinear equations within a region defined by bounds on the variables. Where practical, the package should find all roots with mathematical certainty. Though based on interval Newton methods, it is self-contained. It allows various control and output options and does not require programming if the equations are polynomials; it is structured for further algorithmic research. Its practicality does not depend in a simple way on the dimension of the system or on the degree of nonlinearity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18645","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18645","fieldValue":"ACM"}
