In an ordinal embedding, it is the relative order between pairs of distances, and not the distances themselves, that must be preserved as much as possible. The (multiplicative) relaxation of an ordinal embedding is the maximum ratio between two distances whose relative order is inverted by the embedding. We develop several worst-case bounds and approximation algorithms on ordinal embedding. In particular, we establish that ordinal embedding has many qualitative differences from metric embedding, and we capture the ordinal behavior of ultrametrics and shortest-path metrics of unweighted trees."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14150","fieldValue":" We propose a more general form of functional dependency for semantic data models that derives from their common feature in which the separate notions of domain and relation in the relational model are combined into a single notion of class. This usually results in a richer terminological component for their query languages, whereby terms may navigate through any number of properties, including none. We prove the richer expressiveness of this more general functional dependency, and exhibit a sound and complete set of inference axioms. Although the general problem of decidability of their logical implication remains open at this time, we present decision procedures for cases in which the dependencies included in a schema correspond to keys, or in which the schema itself is acyclic. The theory is then extended to include a form of conjunctive query. Of particular significance is that the query becomes an additional source of functional dependency. Finally, we outline several applications of the theory to various problems in physical design and in query optimization. The applications derive from an ability to predict when a query can have at most one solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14150","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14150","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14151","fieldValue":"Van Gucht, Dirk"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14151","fieldValue":" Nested relations generalize ordinary flat relations by allowing tuple values to be either atomic or set valued. The nested algebra is a generalization of the flat relational algebra to manipulate nested relations. In this paper we study the expressive power of the nested algebra relative to its operation on flat relational databases. We show that the flat relational algebra is rich enough to extract the same â\u20ACœflat informationâ\u20AC? from a flat database as the nested algebra does. Theoretically, this result implies that recursive queries such as the transitive closure of a binary relation cannot be expressed in the nested algebra. Practically, this result is relevant to (flat) relational query optimization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14151","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14151","fieldValue":"ACM"}
