The loudspeaker precompensation consists in a per-frame signal optimization. In order to minimize the perceptible distortion incurred in the loudspeaker, a psychoacoustically motivated optimization criterion is proposed. The resulting per-frame signal optimization problems are solved efficiently using first-order optimization methods. Depending on the invertibility and the smoothness of the memoryless nonlinearity, different first-order optimization methods are proposed and their convergence properties are analyzed. Objective evaluation experiments using synthetic loudspeaker models and real loudspeakers show that the proposed loudspeaker precompensation algorithm provides a significant audio quality improvement, especially so at high playback levels."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3709","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3709","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3710","fieldValue":" The data sparsity problem is addressed by using the decision tree state clusters as the training targets for the state-of-the-art context-dependent (CD) deep neural network (DNN) systems. The CD states within a cluster cannot be distinguished at the frame level. We surmise that the state clustering may cause an issue for the standard CD-DNNs, which has so far not been addressed in the literature. In this paper, a logistic regression framework is proposed for the CD-DNNs based on a set of broad phone classes to address both the data sparsity and the clustering problems. To address the data sparsity issue, the triphones are clustered into shorter biphones with broad phone contexts under multiple articulatory categories. A DNN is trained to discriminate the disjoint biphone clusters within each articulatory category. The regression bases are formed by the concatenated log posterior probabilities of all the broad phone DNNs. Logistic regression is used to transform the regression bases into the triphone state posteriors. Clustering of the regression parameters is used to reduce the regression model complexity while still achieving unique acoustic scores for all possible triphones. Based on some approximations, the regression model can be trained as a sparse softmax layer and its parameters can be learned by optimizing the cross-entropy criterion. The experimental results on a broadcast news transcription task reveal that the proposed regression-based CD-DNN significantly outperforms the standard CD-DNN. The best system provides a 1.3% absolute word error rate reduction compared to the best standard CD-DNN system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1281","fieldValue":" Theoretical modeling of computer virus\/worm epidemic dynamics is an important problem that has attracted many studies. However, most existing models are adapted from biological epidemic ones. Although biological epidemic models can certainly be adapted to capture some computer virus spreading scenarios (especially when the so-called homogeneity assumption holds), the problem of computer virus spreading is not well understood because it has many important perspectives that are not necessarily accommodated in the biological epidemic models. In this article, we initiate the study of such a perspective, namely that of adaptive defense against epidemic spreading in arbitrary networks. More specifically, we investigate a nonhomogeneous Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model where the model parameters may vary with respect to time. In particular, we focus on two scenarios we call semi-adaptive defense and fully adaptive defense, which accommodate implicit and explicit dependency relationships between the model parameters, respectively. In the semi-adaptive defense scenario, the modelâ\u20AC™s input parameters are given; the defense is semi-adaptive because the adjustment is implicitly dependent upon the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we present a set of sufficient conditions (some are more general or succinct than others) under which the virus spreading will die out; such sufficient conditions are also known as epidemic thresholds in the literature. In the fully adaptive defense scenario, some input parameters are not known (i.e., the aforementioned sufficient conditions are not applicable) but the defender can observe the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we present adaptive control strategies under which the virus spreading will die out or will be contained to a desired level."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1281","fieldValue":"ACM"}
