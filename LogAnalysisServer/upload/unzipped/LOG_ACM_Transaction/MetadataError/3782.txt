Our protocol is actually an abstraction of the key exchange protocol of Katz et al. and is based on the recently introduced notion of smooth projective hashing by Cramer and Shoup. We gain a number of benefits from this abstraction. First, we obtain a modular protocol that can be described using just three high-level cryptographic tools. This allows a simple and intuitive understanding of its security. Second, our proof of security is significantly simpler and more modular. Third, we are able to derive analogs to the Katz et al. protocol under additional cryptographic assumptions. Specifically, in addition to the DDH assumption used by Katz et al., we obtain protocols under both the quadratic and N-residuosity assumptions. In order to achieve this, we construct new smooth projective hash functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3118","fieldValue":" This article presents an elegant technique for extracting the low-level stroke features, such as endpoints, junction points, line elements, and curve elements, from offline printed text using a template matching approach. The proposed features are used to classify a subset of characters from Gujarati script. The database consists of approximately 16,782 samples of 42 middle-zone symbols from the Gujarati character set collected from three different sources: machine printed books, newspapers, and laser printed documents. The purpose of this division is to add variety in terms of size, font type, style, ink variation, and boundary deformation. The experiments are performed on the database using a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and results are compared with other widely used structural features, namely Chain Codes (CC), Directional Element Features (DEF), and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG). The results show that the features are quite robust against the variations and give comparable performance with other existing works."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3118","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3118","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22206","fieldValue":"Van Oorschot, Paul C."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22206","fieldValue":" Automated Turing Tests (ATTs), also known as human-in-the-loop techniques, were recently employed in a login protocol by Pinkas and Sander (2002) to protect against online password-guessing attacks. We present modifications providing a new history-based login protocol with ATTs, which uses failed-login counts. Analysis indicates that the new protocol offers opportunities for improved security and user friendliness (fewer ATTs to legitimate users) and greater flexibility (e.g., allowing protocol parameter customization for particular situations and users). We also note that the Pinkas--Sander and other protocols involving ATTs are susceptible to minor variations of well-known middle-person attacks. We discuss complementary techniques to address such attacks, and to augment the security of the original protocol."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22206","fieldValue":"ACM"}
