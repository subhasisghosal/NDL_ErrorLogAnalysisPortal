An obvious solution is to duty cycle the GPS module, which prolongs the device lifetime at the cost of increased position uncertainty while the GPS is off. This article addresses the trade-off between energy consumption and localization performance in a mobile sensor network application. The focus is on augmenting GPS location with more energy-efficient location sensors to bound position estimate uncertainty while GPS is off. Empirical GPS and radio contact data from a large-scale animal tracking deployment is used to model node mobility, radio performance, and GPS. Because GPS takes a considerable, and variable, time after powering up before it delivers a good position measurement, we model the GPS behavior through empirical measurements of two GPS modules. These models are then used to explore duty cycling strategies for maintaining position uncertainty within specified bounds. We then explore the benefits of using short-range radio contact logging alongside GPS as an energy-inexpensive means of lowering uncertainty while the GPS is off, and we propose strategies that use RSSI ranging and GPS back-offs to further reduce energy consumption. Results show that our combined strategies can cut node energy consumption by one third while still meeting application-specific positioning criteria."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21419","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2422966.2422980\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21419","fieldValue":"GPS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21419","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21419","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21420","fieldValue":" In wireless sensor networks, a critical system service is the localization service that determines the locations of geographically distributed sensor nodes. The raw data used by this service are the distance measurements between neighboring nodes and the position knowledge of anchor nodes. However, these raw data may contain outliers that strongly deviate from their true values, which include both the outlier distances and the outlier anchors. These outliers can severely degrade the accuracy of the localization service. Therefore, we need a robust localization algorithm that can reject these outliers. Previous studies in this field mainly focus on enhancing multilateration with outlier rejection ability, since multilateration is a primitive operation used by localization service. But patch merging, a powerful operation for increasing the percentage of localizable nodes in sparse networks, is almost neglected. We thus propose a robust patch merging operation that can reject outliers for both multilateration and patch merging. Based on this operation, we further propose a robust network localization algorithm called RobustLoc. This algorithm makes two major contributions. (1) RobustLoc can achieve a high percentage of localizable nodes in both dense and sparse networks. In contrast, previous methods based on robust multilateration almost always fail in sparse networks with average degrees between 5 and 7. Our experiments show that RobustLoc can localize about 90&percnt; of nodes in a sparse network with 5.5 degrees. (2) As far as we know, RobustLoc is the first to uncover the differences between outlier distances and outlier anchors. Our simulations show that RobustLoc can reject colluding outlier anchors reliably in both convex and concave networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21420","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2422966.2422981\"}"}
