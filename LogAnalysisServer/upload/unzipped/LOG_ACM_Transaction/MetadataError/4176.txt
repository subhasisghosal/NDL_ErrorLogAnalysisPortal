However, the conditions in which an image is displayed can adversely affect its appearance. Computer monitor screens not only emit light, but can also reflect extraneous light present in the viewing environment. This can cause images displayed on a monitor to appear faded by reducing their perceived contrast. Current approaches to this problem involve measuring this ambient illumination with specialized hardware and then altering the display device or changing the viewing conditions. This is not only impractical, but also costly and time consuming. For a user who does not have the equipment, expertise, or budget to control these facets, a practical alternative is sought. This paper presents a method whereby the display device itself can be used to determine the effect of ambient light on perceived contrast, thus enabling the viewers themselves to perform visual calibration. This method is grounded in established psychophysical experimentation and we present both an extensive procedure and an equivalent rapid procedure. Our work is extended by providing a novel method of contrast correction so that the contrast of an image viewed in bright conditions can be corrected to appear the same as an image viewed in a darkened room. This is verified through formal validation. These methods are easy to apply in practical settings, while accurate enough to be useful."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3289","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3289","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23594","fieldValue":" Decision Support Systems (DSSs), computer-based systems intended to assist managers in preparing and analyzing decisions, have been single-user systems for most of the past decade. Only recently has DSS research begun to study the implications of the fact that most complex managerial decisions involve multiple decision makers and analysts. A number of tools for facilitating group decisions have been proposed under the label Group Decision Support Systems (GDSSs).One of the most important functions of a GDSS is to provide problem-oriented services for communication among decision makers. On the basis of an analysis of the communication requirements in various group decision settings, this paper presents an architecture for defining and enforcing dynamic application-level protocols that organize decision group interaction. The architecture has been implemented on a network of personal computers in Co-oP, a GDSS for cooperative group decision making based on interactive, multiple-criteria decision methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23594","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23594","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23595","fieldValue":"Ho, Cheng-Seen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23595","fieldValue":"Hong, Yang-Chang"}
