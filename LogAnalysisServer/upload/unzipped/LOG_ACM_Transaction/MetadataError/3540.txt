{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21518","fieldValue":" Structural health monitoring (SHM) refers to the process of implementing a damage detection and characterization strategy for engineering structures. Its objective is to monitor the integrity of structures and detect and pinpoint the locations of possible damages. Although wired network systems still dominate in SHM applications, it is commonly believed that wireless sensor network (WSN) systems will be deployed for SHM in the near future, due to their intrinsic advantages. However, the constraints (e.g., communication, fault tolerance, energy) of WSNs must be considered before their deployment on structures. In this article, we study the methodology of sensor placement optimization for WSN-based SHM. Sensor placement plays a vital role in SHM applications, where sensor nodes are placed on critical locations that are of civil\/structural engineering importance. We design a three-phase sensor placement approach, named TPSP, aiming to achieve the following objectives: finding a high-quality placement for a given set of sensors that satisfies the engineering requirements, ensuring communication efficiency and reliability and low placement complexity, and reducing the probability of failures in a WSN. Along with the sensor placement, we enable sensor nodes to develop â\u20ACœconnectivity treesâ\u20AC? in such a way that maintaining structural health state and network connectivity, for example, in case of a sensor fault, can be done in a distributed manner. The trees are constructed once (unlike dynamic clusters or trees) and do not incur additional communication costs for the WSN. We optimize the performance of TPSP by considering multiple objectives: low communication cost, fault tolerance, and lifetime prolongation. We validate the effectiveness and performance of TPSP through both simulations using real datasets and a proof-of-concept system on a physical structure."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/3050","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"16\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3053\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing : Volume 16\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"15\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3052\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing : Volume 15\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"14\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3051\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing : Volume 14\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21519","fieldValue":"Naraghi-Pour, Mort"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21519","fieldValue":" We present a novel algorithm for localization of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) called Distributed Randomized Gradient Descent (DRGD) and prove that in the case of noise-free distance measurements, the algorithm converges and provides the true location of the nodes. For noisy distance measurements, the convergence properties of DRGD are discussed and an error bound on the location estimation error is obtained. In contrast to several recently proposed methods, DRGD does not require that the blind nodes be contained in the convex hull of the anchor nodes, and it can accurately localize the network with only a few anchors. Performance of DRGD is evaluated through extensive simulations and compared with three other algorithms, namely, the relaxation-based Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP), the Simulated Annealing (SA), and the Semi-Definite Programing (SDP). Similar to DRGD, SOCP and SA are distributed algorithms, whereas SDP is centralized. The results show that DRGD successfully localizes the nodes in all the cases, whereas in many cases SOCP and SA fail. Finally, we present a modification of DRGD for mobile WSNs and demonstrate the efficacy of DRGD for localization of mobile networks with several simulation results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21519","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21519","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21520","fieldValue":" Secret key establishment is a fundamental requirement for private communication between two entities. In this article, we propose and evaluate a new approach for secret key extraction where multiple sensors collaborate in exchanging probe packets and collecting channel measurements. Essentially, measurements from multiple channels have a substantially higher differential entropy compared to the measurements from a single channel, thereby resulting in more randomness in the information source for key extraction, and this in turn produces stronger secret keys. We also explore the fundamental trade-off between the quadratic increase in the number of measurements of the channels due to multiple nodes per group versus a linear reduction in the sampling rate and a linear increase in the time gap between bidirectional measurements. To experimentally evaluate collaborative secret key extraction in wireless sensor networks, we first build a simple yet flexible testbed with multiple TelosB sensor nodes. Next, we perform large-scale experiments with different configurations of collaboration. Our experiments show that in comparison to the 1 Ã\u2014 1 configuration, collaboration among sensor nodes significantly increases the secret bit extraction per second, per probe, as well as per millijoule of transmission energy. In addition, we show that the collaborating nodes can improve the performance further when they exploit both space and frequency diversities."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21520","fieldValue":"PHY"}
