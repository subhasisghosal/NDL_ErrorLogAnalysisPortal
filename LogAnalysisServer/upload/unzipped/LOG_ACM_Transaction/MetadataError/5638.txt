Deletions play an important role in human disease and their detection could provide fundamental insights for the development of new diagnostics and treatments. In this paper, we investigate the parsimonious loss of heterozygosity problem (PLOHP), i.e., the problem of partitioning suspected polymorphisms from a set of individuals into a minimum number of deletion areas. Specifically, we generalize Halld√≥rsson et al.'s work by providing a more general formulation of the PLOHP and by showing how one can incorporate different recombination rates and prior knowledge about the locations of deletions. Moreover, we show that the PLOHP can be formulated as a specific version of the clique partition problem in a particular class of graphs called undirected catch-point interval graphs and we prove its general $({\\cal NP})$-hardness. Finally, we provide a state-of-the-art integer programming (IP) formulation and strengthening valid inequalities to exactly solve real instances of the PLOHP containing up to 9,000 individuals and 3,000 SNPs. Our results give perspectives on the mathematics of the PLOHP and suggest new directions on the development of future efficient exact solution approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4999","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4999","fieldValue":"Clique partitioning, submodular functions, polymatroid rank functions, undirected catch-point interval graph, combinatorial optimization, mixed integer programming, computational biology, loss of heterozygosity, genome-wide association studies, single nucleotide polymorphism"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5000","fieldValue":"Moret, Bernard M E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5000","fieldValue":" Alternative splicing is now recognized as a major mechanism for transcriptome and proteome diversity in higher eukaryotes, yet its evolution is poorly understood. Most studies focus on the evolution of exons and introns at the gene level, while only few consider the evolution of transcripts. In this paper, we present a framework for transcript phylogenies where ancestral transcripts evolve along the gene tree by gains, losses, and mutation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on a set of 805 genes and two different topics. First, we improve a method for transcriptome reconstruction from ESTs (ASPic), then we study the evolution of function in transcripts. The use of transcript phylogenies allows us to double the precision of ASPic, whereas results on the functional study reveal that conserved transcripts are more likely to share protein domains than functional sites. These studies validate our framework for the study of evolution in large collections of organisms from the perspective of transcripts; for this purpose, we developed and provide a new tool, TrEvoR."}
