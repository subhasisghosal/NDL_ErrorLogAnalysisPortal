We begin with a single motion capture example of each skill and then learn reduced-order linear feedback control laws that provide robust execution of the motions during forward dynamic simulation. We then parameterize each skill with respect to the environment, such as the height of obstacles, or with respect to the task parameters, such as running speed and direction. We employ a continuation process to achieve the required parameterization of the motions and their affine feedback laws. The continuation method uses a predictor-corrector method based on radial basis functions. Lastly, we build control laws specific to the sequential composition of different skills, so that the simulated character can robustly transition to obstacle clearing maneuvers from running whenever obstacles are encountered. The learned transition skills work in tandem with a simple online step-based planning algorithm, and together they robustly guide the character to achieve a state that is well-suited for the chosen obstacle-clearing motion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16743","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16743","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2587","fieldValue":"Jayram, T S"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2587","fieldValue":"Woodruff, David P"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2587","fieldValue":" The Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform is a dimensionality reduction technique with a wide range of applications to theoretical computer science. It is specified by a distribution over projection matrices from $R^n â\u2020\u2019 Rk where k n and states that k = O(&epsiv;âˆ\u20192 log 1\/Î\u201D) dimensions suffice to approximate the norm of any fixed vector in Rn to within a factor of 1 Â± &epsiv; with probability at least 1 âˆ\u2019 Î\u201D. In this article, we show that this bound on k is optimal up to a constant factor, improving upon a previous Î©((&epsiv;âˆ\u20192 log 1\/Î\u201D)\/log(1\/&epsiv;)) dimension bound of Alon. Our techniques are based on lower bounding the information cost of a novel one-way communication game and yield the first space lower bounds in a data stream model that depend on the error probability Î\u201D. For many streaming problems, the most naÃ¯ve way of achieving error probability Î\u201D is to first achieve constant probability, then take the median of O(log 1\/Î\u201D) independent repetitions. Our techniques show that for a wide range of problems, this is in fact optimal! As an example, we show that estimating the $&ell;_p$-distance for any pâ\u20AC\u2030âˆˆâ\u20AC\u2030[0,2] requires Î©(&epsiv;âˆ\u20192 log n log 1\/Î\u201D) space, even for vectors in {0,1}n. This is optimal in all parameters and closes a long line of work on this problem. We also show the number of distinct elements requires Î©(&epsiv;âˆ\u20192 log 1\/Î\u201D + log n) space, which is optimal if &epsiv;âˆ\u20192$ = Î©(log n). We also improve previous lower bounds for entropy in the strict turnstile and general turnstile models by a multiplicative factor of Î©(log 1\/Î\u201D). Finally, we give an application to one-way communication complexity under product distributions, showing that, unlike the case of constant Î\u201D, the VC-dimension does not characterize the complexity when Î\u201Dâ\u20AC\u2030=â\u20AC\u2030o(1)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2587","fieldValue":"ACM"}
