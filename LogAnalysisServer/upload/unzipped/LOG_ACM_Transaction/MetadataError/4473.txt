The efficient search of yellow pages is becoming a rapidly evolving research area. The underlying data maintained in yellow pages search engines are typically labeled according to Standard Industry Classification (SIC) categories, and users can search yellow pages with categories according to their interests. Categorizing yellow pages queries into a subset of topical categories can help to improve search experience and quality. However, yellow pages queries are usually short and ambiguous. In addition, a yellow pages query taxonomy is typically organized by a hierarchy of a fairly large number of categories. These characteristics make automatic yellow pages query categorization difficult and challenging. In this article, we propose a flexible yellow pages query categorization approach. The proposed technique is built based on a TF-IDF similarity taxonomy matching scheme that is able to provide more accurate query categorization than previous keyword-based matching schemes. To further improve the categorization performance, we design several filtering schemes. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate encouraging results. We obtain F1 measures of about 0.5 and 0.3 for categorizing yellow pages queries into 19 coarse categories and 244 finer categories, respectively. We investigate different components in the proposed approach and also demonstrate the superiority of our approach over a hierarchical support vector machine classifier."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24438","fieldValue":"Leung, Kenneth Wai-Ting"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24438","fieldValue":" Personalized search is an important means to improve the performance of a search engine. In this article, we propose a framework that supports mining a user's conceptual preferences from users' clickthrough data resulting from Web search. The discovered preferences are utilized to adapt a search engine's ranking function. In this framework, an extended set of conceptual preferences was derived for a user based on the concepts extracted from the search results and the clickthrough data. Then, a concept-based user profile (CUP) representing the user profile as a concept ontology tree is generated. Finally, the CUP is input to a support vector machine (SVM) to learn a concept preference vector for adapting a personalized ranking function that reranks the search results. In order to achieve more flexible personalization, the framework allows a user to control the amount of specific CUP ontology information to be exposed to the personalized search engine. We study various parameters, such as conceptual relationships and concept features, arising from CUP that affect the ranking quality. Experiments confirm that our approach is able to significantly improve the retrieval effectiveness for the user. Further, our proposed control parameters of CUP information can adjust the exposed user information more smoothly and maintain better ranking quality than the existing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24438","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24438","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3370","fieldValue":" An individual's prior experience will influence how new visual information in a scene is perceived and remembered. Accuracy of memory performance per se is an imperfect reflection of the cognitive activity (awareness states) that underlies performance in memory tasks. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of varied visual fidelity of training environments on the transfer of training to the real world after exposure to immersive simulations representing a real-world scene. A between groups experiment was carried out to explore the effect of rendering quality on measurements of location-based recognition memory for objects and associated states of awareness. The immersive simulation consisted of one room that was either rendered flat-shaded or using radiosity rendering. The simulation was displayed on a stereo head-tracked head mounted display. Post exposure to the synthetic simulation, participants completed a memory recognition task conducted in a real-world scene by physically arranging objects in their physical form in a real-world room. Participants also reported one of four states of awareness following object recognition. They were given several options of awareness states that reflected the level of visual mental imagery involved during retrieval, the familiarity of the recollection and related guesses. The scene incorporated objects that â\u20ACœfittedâ\u20AC? into the specific context of the real-world scene, referred to as consistent objects, and objects that were not related to the specific context of the real-world scene, referred to as inconsistent objects. A follow-up study was conducted a week after the initial test. Interestingly, results revealed a higher proportion of correct object recognition associated with mental imagery when participants were exposed to low-fidelity flat-shaded training scenes rather than the radiosity rendered ones. Memory psychology indicates that awareness states based on visual imagery require stronger attentional processing in the first instance than those based on familiarity. A tentative claim would, therefore, be that those immersive environments that are distinctive because of their variation from â\u20ACœreal,â\u20AC? such as flat-shaded environments, recruit stronger attentional resources. This additional attentional processing may bring about a change in participants' subjective experiences of â\u20ACœrememberingâ\u20AC? when they later transfer the training from that environment into a real-world situation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3370","fieldValue":"ACM"}
