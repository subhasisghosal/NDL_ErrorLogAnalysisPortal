These calls have been at least partially answered by several specifications and technologies. In fact, Tanenbaum [1988] has remarked that the â\u20ACœnice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from.â\u20AC? Tanenbaum goes on to say that â\u20ACœif you do not like any of them, you can just wait for next year's model.â\u20AC? This article does not seek to introduce next year's model. Rather, the goal is to contribute to the larger simulation community the authors' accumulated experiences from developing several implementations of an agent-based simulation toolkit. As such, this article focuses on the implementation of simulation architectures rather than agent communications languages. It is hoped that ongoing architecture standards efforts will benefit from this new knowledge and use it to produce architecture standards with increased robustness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24916","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24916","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24917","fieldValue":" The design of many production and service systems is informed by stochastic model analysis. But the parameters of statistical distributions of stochastic models are rarely known with certainty, and are often estimated from field data. Even if the mean system performance is a known function of the model's parameters, there may still be uncertainty about the mean performance because the parameters are not known precisely. Several methods have been proposed to quantify this uncertainty, but data sampling plans have not yet been provided to reduce parameter uncertainty in a way that effectively reduces uncertainty about mean performance. The optimal solution is challenging, so we use asymptotic approximations to obtain closed-form results for sampling plans. The results apply to a wide class of stochastic models, including situations where the mean performance is unknown but estimated with simulation. Analytical and empirical results for the M\/M\/1 queue, a quadratic response-surface model, and a simulated critical care facility illustrate the ideas."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24917","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24917","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24918","fieldValue":" Ranking and selection procedures (R&S) were developed by statisticians to search for the best among a small collection of populations or treatments, where the â\u20ACœbestâ\u20AC? treatment is typically the one with the largest or smallest expected(long-run average) response. R&S procedures have been successfully extended to address situations that are encountered in stochastic simulation of alternative system designs, including unequal variances across alternatives, dependence both within the output of each system and across the outputs from alternative systems, and large numbers of alternatives to compare. In nearly all cases the estimator of the expected response is a (perhaps generalized) sample mean of the output of interest. In this article we derive R&S procedures that employ control-variate estimators instead of sample means. Control variates can be much more statistically efficient than sample means, leading to R&S procedures that are correspondingly more efficient. We also consider the related problem of estimating the expected value of the best (as opposed to the selected) system design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24918","fieldValue":"ACM"}
