Existing studies try to detour around links and nodes during traffic forwarding to save powers for energy-efficient routing. However, energy-efficient routing in traditional IP networks is not well addressed. The most challenges within an energy-efficient routing scheme in IP networks lie in safety and practicality. The scheme should ensure routing stability and loop-and congestion-free packet forwarding, while not requiring modifications in the traditional IP forwarding diagram and shortest-path routing protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient routing approach called safe and practical energy-efficient detour routing (SPEED) for power savings in IP networks. We provide theoretical insight into energy-efficient routing and prove that determining if energy-efficient routing exists is NP-complete. We develop a heuristic in SPEED to maximize pruned links in computing energy-efficient routings. Extensive experimental results show that SPEED significantly saves power consumptions without incurring network congestions using real network topologies and traffic matrices."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10690","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10691","fieldValue":" We consider a stochastic model of jobs arriving at a cloud data center. Each job requests a certain amount of CPU, memory, disk space, etc. Job sizes (durations) are also modeled as random variables, with possibly unbounded support. These jobs need to be scheduled nonpreemptively on servers. The jobs are first routed to one of the servers when they arrive and are queued at the servers. Each server then chooses a set of jobs from its queues so that it has enough resources to serve all of them simultaneously. This problem has been studied previously under the assumption that job sizes are known and upper-bounded, and an algorithm was proposed that stabilizes traffic load in a diminished capacity region. Here, we present a load balancing and scheduling algorithm that is throughput-optimal, without assuming that job sizes are known or are upper-bounded."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10691","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10691","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10691","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10692","fieldValue":" Understanding the packet delivery performance of a wireless sensor network (WSN) is critical for improving system performance and exploring future developments and applications of WSN techniques. In spite of many empirical measurements in the literature, we still lack in-depth understanding on how and to what extent different factors contribute to the overall packet losses for a complete stack of protocols at large scale. Specifically, very little is known about: 1) when, where, and under what kind of circumstances packet losses occur; 2) why packets are lost. As a step toward addressing those issues, we deploy a large-scale WSN and design a measurement system for retrieving important system metrics. We propose MAP, a step-by-step methodology to identify the losses, extract system events, and perform spatial-temporal correlation analysis by employing a carefully examined causal graph. MAP enables us to get a closer look at the root causes of packet losses in a low-power ad hoc network. This study validates some earlier conjectures on WSNs and reveals some new findings. The quantitative results also shed lights for future large-scale WSN deployments."}
