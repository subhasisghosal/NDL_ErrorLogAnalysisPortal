A phone-based Mandarin--English speech recognizer was first employed for obtaining the senone sequence of a speech utterance. For each senone, acoustic features and the posterior probability of the articulatory features (AFs) were extracted and applied to an eigenspace transformation, based on principal component analysis (PCA). Latent semantic analysis (LSA) was then adopted for constructing a matrix to model the importance of each principal component in the eigenspace for the senones and AFs in each language. The spatial relationships among the senones (or AFs) represented by the PCA-transformed eigenvalues in the LSA-based matrix were employed to construct an LLSM for characterizing a language. In code-switching event detection, the language likelihood between the input speech LLSM and each of the language-dependent LLSMs was estimated. The Euclidian-distance-based similarities and cosine-angle-distance-based similarities were adopted for estimating the language likelihood for senones and AFs. The Î\u201DBIC was then used for estimating the language transition score for each hypothesized code-switching event. Finally, the dynamic programming algorithm was employed for obtaining the most likely code-switching language sequence. The proposed approach was evaluated using a Mandarin--English code-switching speech database and outperformed other conventional methods. A duration accuracy of 72.45% can be obtained from the proposed system with optimized parameters."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/3825","fieldValue":"Delta-Bayesian information criterion (&Delta;BIC)"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3825","fieldValue":"Code-switching event detection by using a latent language space model and the delta-Bayesian information criterion"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3825","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3825","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1291","fieldValue":" The evolution of smartphones has given rise to urban-area applications: applications that communicate in a city by means of the public (moving) infrastructure (e.g., buses and trams). In this setting, applications need to communicate with and discover each other using intermediaries that move around the city and transfer data between them. This requires programmers to scatter code that deals with routing messages to the correct place and deal with network failures all over their programs. Our approach allows the programmer to specify urban-area applications in a high-level manner without the burden of directly encoding communication using intermediaries. We present this as a translation from a high-level object-oriented programming paradigm to a low-level communication mechanism. This translation allows the programmer to restrict routing of messages to, for example, a certain number of hops, geographic areas, or even types of carrier devices. In addition, we show how high-level group messaging can be efficiently represented in the low-level communication. Finally, we document our experiences in setting up a small-scale real-world urban-area application."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1291","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1291","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3826","fieldValue":" This paper describes an online algorithm for enhancing monaural noisy speech. First, a novel phase-corrected low-delay gammatone filterbank is derived for signal subband decomposition and resynthesis; the subband signals are then analyzed frame by frame. Second, a novel feature named periodicity degree (PD) is proposed to be used for detecting and estimating the fundamental period $(P_o) in each frame and for estimating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in each frame-subband signal unit. The PD is calculated in each unit as the multiplication of the normalized autocorrelation and the comb filter ratio, and shown to be robust in various low-SNR conditions. Third, the noise energy level in each signal unit is estimated recursively based on the estimated SNR for units with high PD and based on the noisy signal energy level for units with low PD. Then the a priori SNR is estimated using a decision-directed approach with the estimated noise level. Finally, a revised Wiener gain is calculated, smoothed, and applied to each unit; the processed units are summed across subbands and frames to form the enhanced signal. The Po$ detection accuracy of the algorithm was evaluated on two corpora and showed comparable performance on one corpus and better performance on the other corpus when compared to a recently published pitch detection algorithm. The speech enhancement effect of the algorithm was evaluated on one corpus with two objective criteria and showed better performance in one highly non-stationary noise and comparable performance in two other noises when compared to a state-of-the-art statistical-model based algorithm."}
