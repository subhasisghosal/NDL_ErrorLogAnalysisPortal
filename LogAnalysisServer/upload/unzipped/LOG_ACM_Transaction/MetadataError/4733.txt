Among the key elements for the success of these applications is how to effectively and efficiently manage and store a huge amount of audio visual information, while at the same time providing user-friendly access to the stored data. This has fueled a quickly evolving research area known as video abstraction. As the name implies, video abstraction is a mechanism for generating a short summary of a video, which can either be a sequence of stationary images (keyframes) or moving images (video skims). In terms of browsing and navigation, a good video abstract will enable the user to gain maximum information about the target video sequence in a specified time constraint or sufficient information in the minimum time. Over past years, various ideas and techniques have been proposed towards the effective abstraction of video contents. The purpose of this article is to provide a systematic classification of these works. We identify and detail, for each approach, the underlying components and how they are addressed in specific works."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25272","fieldValue":" Well-produced videos provide a convenient and effective way to archive lectures. In this article, we offer a new way to create lecture videos that retains many of the advantages of well-composed recordings, without the cost and intrusion of a video production crew. We present an automated system called Virtual Videography that employs the art of videography to mimic videographer-produced videos, while unobtrusively recording lectures. The system uses the data recorded by unattended video cameras and microphones to produce a new edited video as an offline postprocess. By producing videos offline, our system can use future information when planning shot sequences and synthesizing new shots. Using simple syntactic cues gathered from the original video and a novel shot planning algorithm, the system makes cinematic decisions without any semantic understanding of the lecture."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25272","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25272","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25273","fieldValue":"Yan, Wei-Qi"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25273","fieldValue":" We propose a novel transcoding technique called multimedia simplification which is based on experiential sampling. Multimedia simplification helps optimize the synthesis of MMS (multimedia messaging service) messages for mobile phones. Transcoding is useful in overcoming the limitations of these compact devices. The proposed approach aims at reducing the redundancy in the multimedia data captured by multiple types of media sensors. The simplified data is first stored into a gallery for further usage. Once a request for MMS is received, the MMS server makes use of the simplified media from the gallery. The multimedia data is aligned with respect to the timeline for MMS message synthesis. We demonstrate the use of the proposed techniques for two applications, namely, soccer video and home care monitoring video. The MMS sent to the receiver can basically reflect the gist of important events of interest to the user. Our technique is targeted towards users who are interested in obtaining salient multimedia information via mobile devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25273","fieldValue":"ACM"}
