Our approach relies on experiments wherein we record the response of several users to haptic stimuli. We then learn different classifiers to predict the user response based on a variety of causal signal features. The classifiers that have good prediction accuracy serve as candidates to be used in adaptive sampling. We compare the resultant adaptive samplers based on their rate-distortion tradeoff using synthetic as well as natural data. For our experiments, we use a haptic device with a maximum force level of 3 N and 10 users. Each user is subjected to several piecewise constant haptic signals and is required to click a button whenever he perceives a change in the signal. For classification, we not only use classifiers based on level crossings and Weberâ\u20AC™s law but also random forests using a variety of causal signal features. The random forest typically yields the best prediction accuracy and a study of the importance of variables suggests that the level crossings and Weberâ\u20AC™s classifier features are most dominant. The classifiers based on level crossings and Weberâ\u20AC™s law have good accuracy (more than 90&percnt;) and are only marginally inferior to random forests. The level crossings classifier consistently outperforms the one based on Weberâ\u20AC™s law even though the gap is small. Given their simple parametric form, the level crossings and Weberâ\u20AC™s law--based classifiers are good candidates to be used for adaptive sampling. We study their rate-distortion performance and find that the level crossing sampler is superior. For example, for haptic signals obtained while exploring various rendered objects, for an average sampling rate of 10 samples per second, the level crossings adaptive sampler has a mean square error about 3dB less than the Weber sampler."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/3481","fieldValue":"Weber&rsquo;s law"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3481","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3481","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25715","fieldValue":" Pervasive social networking (PSN) supports online and instant social activities and communications in a universal and pervasive manner on the basis of heterogeneous networks. However, at the same time, when mobile users expect useful and valuable contents via PSN, they may also receive unwanted, unexpected, or even malicious contents. These contents may intrude user devices, occupy device memories, and irritate mobile users. Unwanted content control in PSN has become a crucial issue that impacts the success of PSN usage. Nowadays, the literature still lacks a robust and generic unwanted content control system that can be practically applied. In this article, we present the design and implementation of PSNController, an unwanted content control system in PSN based on trust management. We evaluate the system performance under a variety of intrusions and attacks. The result shows the system is effective with regard to accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. It can control unwanted contents in PSN according to trust evaluation. We further study user acceptance on PSNController prototype system based on a small-scale user study. We receive sound user feedback on PSNController with regard to perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, interface design, playfulness, and acceptance attitude."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25715","fieldValue":"PSNController: An Unwanted Content Control System in Pervasive Social Networking Based on Trust Management"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25715","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25715","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25716","fieldValue":" Participatory sensing is a promising sensing paradigm that enables collection, processing, dissemination and analysis of the phenomena of interest by ordinary citizens through their handheld sensing devices. Participatory sensing has huge potential in many applications, such as smart transportation and air quality monitoring. However, participants may submit low-quality, misleading, inaccurate, or even malicious data if a participatory sensing campaign is not launched effectively. Therefore, it has become a significant issue to establish an efficient participatory sensing campaign for improving the data quality. This article proposes a novel five-tier framework of participatory sensing and addresses several technical challenges in this proposed framework including: (1) optimized deployment of data collection points (DC-points); and (2) efficient recruitment strategy of participants. Toward this end, the deployment of DC-points is formulated as an optimization problem with maximum utilization of sensor and then a Wise-Dynamic DC-points Deployment (WD3) algorithm is designed for high-quality sensing. Furthermore, to guarantee the reliable sensing data collection and communication, a trajectory-based strategy for participant recruitment is proposed to enable campaign organizers to identify well-suited participants for data sensing based on a joint consideration of temporal availability, trust, and energy. Extensive experiments and performance analysis of the proposed framework and associated algorithms are conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a good sensing coverage with a smaller number of DC-points, and the participants that are termed as social sensors are easily selected, to evaluate the feasibility and extensibility of the proposed recruitment strategies."}
