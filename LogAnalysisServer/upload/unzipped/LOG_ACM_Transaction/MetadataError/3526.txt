Prioritization-based service differentiation mechanisms are applied in all layers of communication to satisfy the QoS requirements of each traffic class. The prioritization in the contention is one of these differentiation methods applied in the medium access layer. In this article, we propose an analytical model for the contention latencies and energy expenditures of different classes in a prioritized contention structure with uniform backoff scheme. The contention window is divided into three partitions which are allocated for the use of only high-priority, both priorities, and only low-priority classes. We further generalize the model for binary exponential backoff schemes and for more than two priority classes. In the analysis, we explore the optimum sizes of these partitions in terms of contention latency and the total energy expenditure for each priority class. Our model is also useful for the evaluation of various recent contention prioritization schemes in WSNs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21486","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21486","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21487","fieldValue":" As an integral part of reliable communication in wireless networks, effective link estimation is essential for routing protocols. However, due to the dynamic nature of wireless channels, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task. In this article, we propose 4C, a novel link estimator that applies link quality prediction along with link estimation. Our approach is data driven and consists of three steps: data collection, offline modeling, and online prediction. The data collection step involves gathering link quality data, and based on our analysis of the data, we propose a set of guidelines for the amount of data to be collected in our experimental scenarios. The modeling step includes offline prediction model training and selection. We present three prediction models that utilize different machine learning methods, namely, naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. Our models take a combination of PRR and the physical-layer information, that is, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) as input, and output the success probability of delivering the next packet. From our analysis and experiments, we find that logistic regression works well among the three models with small computational cost. Finally, the third step involves the implementation of 4C, a receiver-initiated online link quality prediction module that computes the short temporal link quality. We conducted extensive experiments in the Motelab and our local indoor testbeds, as well as an outdoor deployment. Our results with single- and multiple-senders experiments show that with 4C, CTP improves the average cost of delivering a packet by 20&percnt; to 30&percnt;. In some cases, the improvement is larger than 45&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21487","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21487","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21488","fieldValue":" In this article, we investigate the problem of controlling node sleep intervals so as to achieve the min-max energy fairness in asynchronous duty-cycling sensor networks. We propose a mathematical model to describe the energy efficiency of such networks and observe that traditional sleep interval setting strategies, for example, operating sensor nodes with an identical sleep interval, or intuitive control heuristics, for example, greedily increasing sleep intervals of sensor nodes with high energy consumption rates, hardly perform well in practice. There is an urgent need to develop an efficient sleep interval control strategy for achieving fair and high energy efficiency. To this end, we theoretically formulate the Sleep Interval Control (SIC) problem and find out that it is a convex optimization problem. By utilizing the convex property, we decompose the original problem and propose a distributed algorithm, called GDSIC. In GDSIC, sensor nodes can tune sleep intervals through a local information exchange such that the maximum energy consumption rate of the network approaches to be minimized. The algorithm is self-adjustable to the traffic load variance and is able to serve as a unified framework for a variety of asynchronous duty-cycling MAC protocols. We implement our approach in a prototype system and test its feasibility and applicability on a 50-node testbed. We further conduct extensive trace-driven simulations to examine the efficiency and scalability of our algorithm with various settings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21488","fieldValue":"ACM"}
