In particular, we conducted an experimental study that investigated the level of sensitivity of the sensors, their performance in recognizing angles, and factors that affected accuracy of recognition of flexion measurements. Among our results, we show that hand size differences among the subjects of the study did not have a statistical effect on the accuracy of the device. We also analyzed the effect of different software calibration approaches on accuracy of the sensors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5503","fieldValue":"Hong, Jung-Kook"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5503","fieldValue":" To define a hypermedia system's ease of use from the user's point of view, we propose three evaluation metrics: an interface shallowness metric, a downward compactness metric, and a downward navigability metric. These express both the cognitive load on users and the structural complexity of the hypermedia contents. We conducted a field study at the National Museum of Ethnology (NME) in Osaka, Japan, to evaluate our hypermedia system and to assess the suitability of our hypermedia metrics from the viewpoint of visiting members of the public. After developing a spreadsheet-type authoring system named HyperEX, we built prototype systems for use by members of the public visiting a special exhibition held at the museum. Questionnaires, interviews, automatic recording of users' navigation operations, and statistical analysis of 449 tested users yielded the following results. First, the suitability of the metrics was found to be satisfactory, indicating that they are useful for developing hypermedia systems. Second, there is a strong relationship between a system's enjoyability and its usability. Transparency and the friendliness of the user interface are the key issues in enjoyability. Finally, the quality of the video strongly affects the overall system evaluation. Video quality is determined by optimum selection of scenes, the length of the video, and appropriate audio-visual expression of the content. This video quality may become the most important issue in developing hypermedia for museum education."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5504","fieldValue":"Vander Zanden, Brad"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5504","fieldValue":" The Lapidary interface design tool is a demonstrational system that allows the graphics and run-time behaviors that go inside an application window to be specified pictorially. In particular, Lapidary allows the designer to draw example pictures of application-specific graphical objects that the end user will manipulate (such as boxes, arrows, or elements of a list), the feedback that shows which objects are selected (such as small boxes on the sides and corners of an object), and the dynamic feedback objects (such as hairline boxes to show where an object is being dragged). The run-time behavior of all these objects can be specified ina straightforward way using constraints, demonstration, and dialog boxes that allow the designer to provide abstract descriptions of the interactive response to the input devices. Lapidary generalizes from these specific example pictures and behaviors to create prototype objects and behaviors from which instances can be made at run-time. A novel feature of Lapidary's implementation is its use of constraints that have been explicitly specified by the designer to help it generalize example objects and behaviors and to guide it in making inferences."}
