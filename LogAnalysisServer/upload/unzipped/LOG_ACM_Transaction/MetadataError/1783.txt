{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16295","fieldValue":" We present a novel approach for summarizing video in the form of a multiscale image that is continuous in both the spatial domain and across the scale dimension: There are no hard borders between discrete moments in time, and a user can zoom smoothly into the image to reveal additional temporal details. We call these artifacts tapestries because their continuous nature is akin to medieval tapestries and other narrative depictions predating the advent of motion pictures. We propose a set of criteria for such a summarization, and a series of optimizations motivated by these criteria. These can be performed as an entirely offline computation to produce high quality renderings, or by adjusting some optimization parameters the later stages can be solved in real time, enabling an interactive interface for video navigation. Our video tapestries combine the best aspects of two common visualizations, providing the visual clarity of DVD chapter menus with the information density and multiple scales of a video editing timeline representation. In addition, they provide continuous transitions between zoom levels. In a user study, participants preferred both the aesthetics and efficiency of tapestries over other interfaces for visual browsing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16295","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16295","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16296","fieldValue":"Wang, Yu-Shuen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16296","fieldValue":"Lin, Hui-Chih"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16296","fieldValue":"Lee, Tong-Yee"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16296","fieldValue":" We introduce a video retargeting method that achieves high-quality resizing to arbitrary aspect ratios for complex videos containing diverse camera and dynamic motions. Previous content-aware retargeting methods mostly concentrated on spatial considerations, attempting to preserve the shape of salient objects in each frame by removing or distorting homogeneous background content. However, sacrificeable space is fundamentally limited in video, since object motion makes foreground and background regions correlated, causing waving and squeezing artifacts. We solve the retargeting problem by explicitly employing motion information and by distributing distortion in both spatial and temporal dimensions. We combine novel cropping and warping operators, where the cropping removes temporally-recurring contents and the warping utilizes available homogeneous regions to mask deformations while preserving motion. Variational optimization allows to find the best balance between the two operations, enabling retargeting of challenging videos with complex motions, numerous prominent objects and arbitrary depth variability. Our method compares favorably with state-of-the-art retargeting systems, as demonstrated in the examples and widely supported by the conducted user study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16296","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16296","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16297","fieldValue":"McDonnell, Rachel"}
