{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2460","fieldValue":" We study the lower-bounded facility location problem which generalizes the classical uncapacitated facility location problem in that it comes with lower bound constraints for the number of clients assigned to a facility in the case that this facility is opened. This problem was introduced independently in the papers by Karger and Minkoff [2000] and by Guha et al. [2000], both of which give bicriteria approximation algorithms for it. These bicriteria algorithms come within a constant factor of the optimal solution cost, but they also violate the lower bound constraints by a constant factor. Our result in this article is the first true approximation algorithm for the lower-bounded facility location problem which respects the lower bound constraints and achieves a constant approximation ratio for the objective function. The main technical idea for the design of the algorithm is a reduction to the capacitated facility location problem, which has known constant-factor approximation algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2460","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2460","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15407","fieldValue":" We combine existing techniques for shape-from-shading and texture synthesis to create a new tool for texturing objects in photographs. Our approach clusters pixels with similar recovered normals into patches on which texture is synthesized. Distorting the texture based on the recovered normals creates the illusion that the texture adheres to the undulations of the photographed surface. Inconsistencies in the recovered surface are disguised by the graphcut blending of the individually textured patches. Further applications include the generation of detail on manually-shaded painting, extracting and synthesizing a displacement map from a texture swatch, and the embossed transfer of normals from one image to another, which would be difficult to create with current image processing packages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15408","fieldValue":" This paper presents a novel algorithm for synthesizing and editing video of natural phenomena that exhibit continuous flow patterns. The algorithm analyzes the motion of textured particles in the input video along user-specified flow lines, and synthesizes seamless video of arbitrary length by enforcing temporal continuity along a second set of user-specified flow lines. The algorithm is simple to implement and use. We used this technique to edit video of water-falls, rivers, flames, and smoke."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15409","fieldValue":" One significant problem in patch-based texture synthesis is the presence of broken features at the boundary of adjacent patches. The reason is that optimization schemes for patch merging may fail when neighborhood search cannot find satisfactory candidates in the sample texture because of an inaccurate similarity measure. In this paper, we consider both curvilinear features and their deformation. We develop a novel algorithm to perform feature matching and alignment by measuring structural similarity. Our technique extracts a feature map from the sample texture, and produces both a new feature map and texture map. Texture synthesis guided by feature maps can significantly reduce the number of feature discontinuities and related artifacts, and gives rise to satisfactory results."}
