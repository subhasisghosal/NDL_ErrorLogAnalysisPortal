We demonstrate how BLIS acts as a productivity multiplier by using it to implement the level-3 BLAS on a variety of current architectures. The systems for which we demonstrate the framework include state-of-the-art general-purpose, low-power, and many-core architectures. We show, with very little effort, how the BLIS framework yields sequential and parallel implementations that are competitive with the performance of ATLAS, OpenBLAS (an effort to maintain and extend the GotoBLAS), and commercial vendor implementations such as AMDâ\u20AC™s ACML, IBMâ\u20AC™s ESSL, and Intelâ\u20AC™s MKL libraries. Although most of this article focuses on single-core implementation, we also provide compelling results that suggest the frameworkâ\u20AC™s leverage extends to the multithreaded domain."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19444","fieldValue":"BLAS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19444","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19444","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19445","fieldValue":" This article proposes a competitive divide-and-conquer algorithm for solving large-scale black-box optimization problems for which there are thousands of decision variables and the algebraic models of the problems are unavailable. We focus on problems that are partially additively separable, since this type of problem can be further decomposed into a number of smaller independent subproblems. The proposed algorithm addresses two important issues in solving large-scale black-box optimization: (1) the identification of the independent subproblems without explicitly knowing the formula of the objective function and (2) the optimization of the identified black-box subproblems. First, a Global Differential Grouping (GDG) method is proposed to identify the independent subproblems. Then, a variant of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is adopted to solve the subproblems resulting from its rotation invariance property. GDG and CMA-ES work together under the cooperative co-evolution framework. The resultant algorithm, named CC-GDG-CMAES, is then evaluated on the CECâ\u20AC™2010 large-scale global optimization (LSGO) benchmark functions, which have a thousand decision variables and black-box objective functions. The experimental results show that, on most test functions evaluated in this study, GDG manages to obtain an ideal partition of the index set of the decision variables, and CC-GDG-CMAES outperforms the state-of-the-art results. Moreover, the competitive performance of the well-known CMA-ES is extended from low-dimensional to high-dimensional black-box problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19445","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19445","fieldValue":"ACM"}
