We observe that the majority of a person's photographs include the faces of a photographer's family and friends and often the errors in these photographs are the most disconcerting. We focus on correcting these types of images and use common faces across images to automatically perform both global and face-specific corrections. Our system achieves this by using face detection to align faces between â\u20ACœgoodâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœbadâ\u20AC? photos such that properties of the good examples can be used to correct a bad photo. These â\u20ACœpersonalâ\u20AC? photos provide strong guidance for a number of operations and, as a result, enable a number of high-quality image processing operations. We illustrate the power and generality of our approach by presenting a novel deblurring algorithm, and we show corrections that perform sharpening, superresolution, in-painting of over- and underexposured regions, and white-balancing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16226","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16226","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16227","fieldValue":"Wu, Tai-Pang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16227","fieldValue":"Fu, Chi-Wing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16227","fieldValue":"Yeung, Sai-Kit"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16227","fieldValue":"Tang, Chi-Keung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16227","fieldValue":" This article introduces an optimization approach for modeling and rendering impossible figures. Our solution is inspired by how modeling artists construct physical 3D models to produce a valid 2D view of an impossible figure. Given a set of 3D locally possible parts of the figure, our algorithm automatically optimizes a view-dependent 3D model, subject to the necessary 3D constraints for rendering the impossible figure at the desired novel viewpoint. A linear and constrained least-squares solution to the optimization problem is derived, thereby allowing an efficient computation and rendering new views of impossible figures at interactive rates. Once the optimized model is available, a variety of compelling rendering effects can be applied to the impossible figure."}
