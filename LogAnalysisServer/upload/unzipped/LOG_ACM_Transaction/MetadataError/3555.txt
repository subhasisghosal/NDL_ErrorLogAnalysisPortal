{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21558","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of monitoring soil moisture evolution using a wireless network of in-situ underground sensors. To reduce cost and prolong lifetime, it is highly desirable to rely on fewer measurements and estimate with higher accuracy the original signal (the temporal evolution of soil moisture). In this article, we explore the use of results from the theory of sparse sampling, including Compressive Sensing (CS) and Matrix Completion (MC), in this application context. We first consider the problem of reconstructing the soil moisture process at a single location using CS. Our physical constraint leads to very sparse measurement matrices, which makes finding a suitable representation basis very challenging: it needs to make the underlying signal sufficiently sparse while at the same time being sufficiently incoherent with the measurement matrix, two common preconditions for CS techniques to work well. We construct a representation basis by exploiting unique features of soil moisture evolution and show that this basis attains a very good tradeoff between its ability to sparsify the signal and its incoherence with measurement matrices that are consistent with our physical constraints. We next consider the problem of jointly reconstructing soil moisture processes at multiple locations, assuming sparse measurements can be taken at each location. We show that the spatial soil moisture process enjoys a low-rank property, a priority for MC. Accordingly, we introduce a spatiotemporal measurement matrix and apply the MC framework to reconstruct the soil moisture field. Extensive numerical evaluation is performed on both real, high-resolution soil moisture data and simulated data and through comparison with a closed-loop scheduling approach. Our results demonstrate that, for a single location, a uniform measurement scheduling followed by CS recovery results in a very nice tradeoff between estimation accuracy, sampling rate, flexibility, and feasibility in implementation. When multiple locations are available, our results show that joint reconstruction using MC in general produces better estimation accuracy than using a single location alone, but it requires the use of independent and random measurement schedules across locations. We also show that these sparse sampling techniques can be augmented so as to be robust against sporadic data outliers\/corruption caused by, for example, intermittent sensor faults."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21558","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21558","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21559","fieldValue":" The data collected by sensor nodes over a geographical region is contaminated with Gaussian and impulsive noise. The conventional gradient-based distributed adaptive estimation algorithms exhibit good performance in the presence of Gaussian noise but perform poorly in impulsive noise environments. Therefore, the objective of this article is to propose a robust distributed adaptive algorithm that alleviates the effect of impulsive noise. An error saturation nonlinearity-based robust distributed strategy is proposed in an incremental cooperative network to estimate the desired parameters in impulsive noise. The steady-state analysis of the proposed error saturation nonlinearity incremental least mean squares (SNILMS) algorithm is carried out by employing the spatial-temporal energy conservation principle. Both theoretical and simulation results show that the presence of the error nonlinearity has made the proposed SNILMS algorithm robust to impulsive noise."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21559","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21559","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21560","fieldValue":" The location and context switching, especially the indoor\/outdoor switching, provides essential and primitive information for upper-layer mobile applications. In this article, we present IODetector: a lightweight sensing service that runs on the mobile phone and detects the indoor\/outdoor environment in a fast, accurate, and efficient manner. Constrained by the energy budget, IODetector primarily leverages lightweight sensing resources, such as light sensors, magnetism sensors, and cell tower signals. For universal applicability, IODetector assumes no prior knowledge (e.g., fingerprints) of the environment and uses only on-board sensors common to mainstream mobile phones. Being a generic and lightweight service component, IODetector greatly benefits many location-based and context-aware applications. We prototype the IODetector on Android mobile phones and evaluate the system comprehensively with data collected from 34 traces that include 133 different places during a 6-week period, employing different phone models. We further perform a case study where we make use of IODetector to instantly infer the GPS availability and localization accuracy in different indoor\/outdoor environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21561","fieldValue":" A key distribution scheme for wireless sensor networks based on a system of dynamic, pairwise keys is considered. In the scheme, each pair of communicating nodes shares pairwise symmetric keys and changes them at every transmission using a set of hashing functions. This article examines security aspects of the protocol. The most important issue is to ensure that it is infeasible for an adversary to restrict exhaustive key search to a subset of the keyspace. This desirable property holds if, after a small number of random key transitions, the distribution of keys among the nodes is close to uniform. The article provides a rigorous mathematical analysis of the distribution of keys and supplements it with experimental results. The problem is reduced to the question of determining mixing time and the stationary distribution of a random walk on a random digraph. It is shown that with probability close to 1, the mixing time is of small order and the fluctuations of the distribution are limited. This ensures the ongoing security of the protocol by making the communications forward secure and protecting against node compromise."}
