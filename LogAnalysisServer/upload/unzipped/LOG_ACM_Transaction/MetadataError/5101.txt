This article deals with a prominent type of such negotiations, namely, multiissue negotiation that runs under continuous-time constraints and in which the negotiating agents have no prior knowledge about their opponentsâ\u20AC™ preferences and strategies. A negotiation strategy called Dragon is described that employs sparse pseudoinput Gaussian processes. Specifically, Dragon enables an agent (1) to precisely model the behavior of its opponents with comparably low computational load and (2) to make decisions effectively and adaptively in very complex negotiation settings. Extensive experimental results, based on a number of negotiation scenarios and state-of-the-art negotiating agents from Automated Negotiating Agents Competitions, are provided. Moreover, the robustness of our strategy is evaluated through both empirical game-theoretic and spatial evolutionary game-theoretic analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3912","fieldValue":"De Sena, Enzo"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3912","fieldValue":"Van Waterschoot, Toon"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3912","fieldValue":" This paper is concerned with an acoustical phenomenon called sweeping echo, which manifests itself in a room impulse response as a distinctive, continuous pitch increase. In this paper, it is shown that sweeping echoes are present (although to greatly varying degrees) in all perfectly rectangular rooms. The theoretical analysis is based on the rigid-wall image solution of the wave equation. Sweeping echoes are found to be caused by the orderly time-alignment of high-order reflections arriving from directions close to the three axial directions. While sweeping echoes have been previously observed in real rooms with a geometry very similar to the rectangular model (e.g., a squash court), they are not perceived in commonly encountered rooms. Room acoustic simulators such as the image method (IM) and finite difference timedomain (FDTD) correctly predict the presence of this phenomenon, which means that rectangular geometries should be used with caution when the objective is to model commonly encountered rooms. Small out-of-square asymmetries in the room geometry are shown to reduce the phenomenon significantly. Randomization of the image sources' position is shown to remove sweeping echoes without the need to model an asymmetrical geometry explicitly. Finally, the performance of three speech and audio processing algorithms is shown to be sensitive to strong sweeping echoes, thus highlighting the need to avoid their occurrence."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3912","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3912","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3913","fieldValue":" We carry out an in-depth investigation on a newly proposed Maximum F1-score Criterion (MFC) discriminative training objective function for Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) based automatic mispronunciation detection that makes use of Gaussian Mixture Model-hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) as acoustic models. The formulation of MFC seeks to directly optimize F1-score by converting the non-differentiable F1-score function into a continuous objective function to facilitate optimization. We present model-space training algorithm according to MFC using extended Baum-Welch form like update equations based on the weak-sense auxiliary function method. We then present MFC based feature-space discriminative training. We train a matrix projecting from posteriors of Gaussians to a normal size feature space, and add the projected features to traditional spectral features. Mispronunciation detection experiments show MFC based model-space training and feature-space training are effective in improving F1-score and other commonly used evaluation metrics. It is also shown MFC training in both the feature-space and model-space outperforms either model-space training or feature-space training alone, and is about 11.6% better than the maximum likelihood (ML) trained baseline in terms of F1-score. Further, we review and compare mispronunciation detection results with the use of MFC and some traditional training criteria that minimize word error rate in speech recognition. The experimental analysis and comparison provide useful insight into the correlations between F1-score maximization and optimization of these training criteria."}
