Both player-controlled avatars and non-player characters are now starting to interact with the environment, other virtual humans and crowds. However, simulating physical contacts between characters and matching appropriate reactions to specific actions is a highly complex problem, and timing errors, force mismatches and angular distortions are common. To investigate the effect of such anomalies on the perceived realism of two-character interactions, we captured a motion corpus of pushing animations and corresponding reactions and then conducted a series of perceptual experiments. We found that participants could easily distinguish between five different interaction forces, even when only one of the characters was visible. Furthermore, they were sensitive to all three types of anomalous interactions: timing errors of over 150ms were acceptable less than 50% of the time, with early or late reactions being equally perceptible; participants could perceive force mismatches, though over-reactions were more acceptable than under-reactions; finally, angular distortions when a character reacts to a pushing force reduce the acceptability of the interactions, but there is some evidence for a preference of expansion away from the pushing character's body. Our results provide insights to aid in designing motion capture sessions, motion editing strategies and balancing animation budgets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16679","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16679","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16680","fieldValue":"McDonnell, Rachel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16680","fieldValue":" The realistic depiction of lifelike virtual humans has been the goal of many movie makers in the last decade. Recently, films such as Tron: Legacy and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button have produced highly realistic characters. In the real-time domain, there is also a need to deliver realistic virtual characters, with the increase in popularity of interactive drama video games (such as L.A. Noireâ\u201E¢ or Heavy Rainâ\u201E¢). There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing. Some developers opt for a stylized rendering (such as cartoon-shading) to avoid a negative reaction [Thompson 2004]. In this paper, we investigate some of the consequences of choosing realistic or stylized rendering in order to provide guidelines for developers for creating appealing virtual characters. We conducted a series of psychophysical experiments to determine whether render style affects how virtual humans are perceived. Motion capture with synchronized eye-tracked data was used throughout to animate custom-made virtual model replicas of the captured actors."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16680","fieldValue":"Render me real?: investigating the effect of render style on the perception of animated virtual humans"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16680","fieldValue":"ACM"}
