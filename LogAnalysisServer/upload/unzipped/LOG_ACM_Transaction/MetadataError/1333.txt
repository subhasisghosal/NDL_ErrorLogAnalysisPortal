Our algorithm deals with general undirected graphs with straight-line edges, and employs several simple criteria for the aesthetic quality of the result. The algorithm is flexible, in that the relative weights of the criteria can be changed. For graphs of modest size it produces good results, competitive with those produced by other methods, notably, the â\u20ACœspring methodâ\u20AC? and its variants."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15134","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15134","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15135","fieldValue":" This article introduces quadrature prefiltering, an accurate, efficient, and fairly simple algorithm for prefiltering polygons for scanline rendering. It renders very high quality images at reasonable cost, strongly suppressing aliasing artifacts. For equivalent RMS error, quadrature prefiltering is significantly faster than either uniform or jittered supersampling. Quadrature prefiltering is simple to implement and space-efficient; it needs only a small two-dimensional lookup table, even when computing nonradially symmetric filter kernels. Previous algorithms have required either three-dimensional tables or a restriction to radially symmetric filter kernels. Though only slightly more complicated to implement than the widely used box prefiltering method, quadrature prefiltering can generate images with much less visible aliasing artifacts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15135","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15135","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15136","fieldValue":" Patterns used for supersampling in graphics have been analyzed from statistical and signal-processing viewpoints.

We present algorithms for computing discrepancy relative to regions that are defined by rectangles, halfplanes, and higher-dimensional figures. Experimental evidence shows that popular supersampling patterns have discrepancies with better asymptotic behavior than random sampling, which is not inconsistent with theoretical bounds on discrepancy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15136","fieldValue":"ACM"}
