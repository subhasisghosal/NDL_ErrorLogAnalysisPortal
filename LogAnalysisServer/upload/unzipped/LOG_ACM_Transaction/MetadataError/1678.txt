To reconstruct 3D geometry in our system, the user draws outlines overlaid on 2D photographs. The 3D structure is then automatically computed by combining the 2D interaction with the multi-view geometric information recovered by performing structure from motion analysis on the input photographs. We utilize vanishing point constraints at multiple stages during the reconstruction, which is particularly useful for architectural scenes where parallel lines are abundant. Our approach enables us to accurately model polygonal faces from 2D interactions in a single image. Our system also supports useful operations such as edge snapping and extrusions. Seamless texture maps are automatically generated by combining multiple input photographs using graph cut optimization and Poisson blending. The user can add brush strokes as hints during the texture generation stage to remove artifacts caused by unmodeled geometric structures. We build models for a variety of architectural scenes from collections of up to about a hundred photographs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2519","fieldValue":" We introduce a new framework for designing online algorithms that can incorporate additional information about the input sequence, while maintaining a reasonable competitive ratio if the additional information is incorrect.

Our method simultaneously performs both a structure-based synthesis and an image-based synthesis to generate a complete urban layout with a plausible street network and with aerial-view imagery. Our approach uses the structure and image data of real-world urban areas and a synthesis algorithm to provide several high-level operations to easily and interactively generate complex layouts by example. The user can create new urban layouts by a sequence of operations such as join, expand, and blend without being concerned about low-level structural details. Further, the ability to blend example urban layout fragments provides a powerful way to generate new synthetic content. We demonstrate our system by creating urban layouts using example fragments from several real-world cities, each ranging from hundreds to thousands of city blocks and parcels."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16028","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16028","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16029","fieldValue":" We propose in this paper a semi-automatic image-based approach to façade modeling that uses images captured along streets and relies on structure from motion to recover camera positions and point clouds automatically as the initial stage for modeling. We start by considering a building façade as a flat rectangular plane or a developable surface with an associated texture image composited from the multiple visible images. A façade is then decomposed and structured into a Directed Acyclic Graph of rectilinear elementary patches. The decomposition is carried out top-down by a recursive subdivision, and followed by a bottom-up merging with the detection of the architectural bilateral symmetry and repetitive patterns. Each subdivided patch of the flat façade is augmented with a depth optimized using the 3D points cloud. Our system also allows for an easy user feedback in the 2D image space for the proposed decomposition and augmentation. Finally, our approach is demonstrated on a large number of façades from a variety of street-side images."}
