However, it is challenging to determinate pitch in strong noise because the harmonic structure is corrupted. In this paper, we estimate pitch using supervised learning, where the probabilistic pitch states are directly learned from noisy speech data. We investigate two alternative neural networks modeling pitch state distribution given observations. The first one is a feedforward deep neural network (DNN), which is trained on static frame-level acoustic features. The second one is a recurrent deep neural network (RNN) which is trained on sequential frame-level features and capable of learning temporal dynamics. Both DNNs and RNNs produce accurate probabilistic outputs of pitch states, which are then connected into pitch contours by Viterbi decoding. Our systematic evaluation shows that the proposed pitch tracking algorithms are robust to different noise conditions and can even be applied to reverberant speech. The proposed approach also significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art pitch tracking algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3753","fieldValue":" Recently, the general Volterra filter (VF) has been adopted for the modeling of parametric loudspeakers. However, the computation complexity of the VF is too high for real-time implementation. In this paper, a one-dimension Volterra filter (ODVF) with much lower complexity is introduced to model and compensate for the nonlinearity of parametric loudspeakers. A theoretical framework for ODVF model identification is established and a method of measuring the ODVF kernels using the exponential swept-sine signal is provided. The validity of modeling the nonlinearity of the parametric loudspeaker using the ODVF is verified theoretically and experimentally. Based on the established ODVF model, an inverse filter is designed to compensate for the 2nd harmonic distortion of the parametric loudspeakers. To further reduce the 3rd harmonic distortion, an improved compensation method is also proposed. Experimental results show that the performance of the ODVF-based compensation is comparable to that of the Volterra-filter based compensation."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3753","fieldValue":"Modeling and compensation for the distortion of parametric loudspeakers using a one-dimension Volterra filter"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3754","fieldValue":"Habets, Emanul A P"}
