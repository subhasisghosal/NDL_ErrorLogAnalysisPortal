This paper introduces a novel system for animating characters whose morphologies are unknown at the time the animation is created. Our authoring tool allows animators to describe motion using familiar posing and key-framing methods. The system records the data in a morphology-independent form, preserving both the animation's structural relationships and its stylistic information. At runtime, the generalized data are applied to specific characters to yield pose goals that are supplied to a robust and efficient inverse kinematics solver. This system allows us to animate characters with highly varying skeleton morphologies that did not exist when the animation was authored, and, indeed, may be radically different than anything the original animator envisioned."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15899","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15899","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15900","fieldValue":" Oscillatory motion is ubiquitous in computer graphics, yet existing animation techniques are ill-suited to its authoring. We introduce a new type of spline for this purpose, known as a \"Wiggly Spline.\" The spline generalizes traditional piecewise cubics when its resonance and damping are set to zero, but creates oscillatory animation when its resonance and damping are changed. The spline provides a combination of direct manipulation and physical realism. To create overlapped and propagating motion, we generate phase shifts of the Wiggly Spline, and use these to control appropriate degrees of freedom in a model. The phase shifts can be created directly by procedural techniques or through a paint-like interface. A further option is to derive the phase shifts statistically by analyzing a time-series of a simulation. In this case, the Wiggly Spline makes it possible to canonicalize a simulation, generalize it by providing frequency and damping controls and control it through direct manipulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15901","fieldValue":" In this paper we present an approach to enrich skeleton-driven animations with physically-based secondary deformation in real time. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel, surface-based deformable model that can interactively emulate the dynamics of both low-and high-frequency volumetric effects. Given a surface mesh and a few sample sequences of its physical behavior, a set of motion parameters of the material are learned during an off-line preprocessing step. The deformable model is then applicable to any given skeleton-driven animation of the surface mesh. Additionally, our dynamic skinning technique can be entirely implemented on GPUs and executed with great efficiency. Thus, with minimal changes to the conventional graphics pipeline, our approach can drastically enhance the visual experience of skeleton-driven animations by adding secondary deformation in real time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15901","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15901","fieldValue":"ACM"}
