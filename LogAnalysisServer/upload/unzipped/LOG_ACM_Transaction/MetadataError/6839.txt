Prior analyses of firm-related forums have considered all participants in the aggregate, failing to recognize the potential for diversity within the populations. However, distinctive groups of forum participants may represent various interests and stakes in a firm worthy of consideration. To perform the stakeholder analyses, the Stakeholder Analyzer system for firm-related web forums is developed following the design science paradigm of information systems research. The design of the system and its approach to stakeholder analysis is guided by two kernel theories, the stakeholder theory of the firm and the systemic functional linguistic theory. A stakeholder analysis identifies distinctive groups of forum participants with shared characteristics expressed in discussion and evaluates their specific opinions and interests in the firm. Stakeholder analyses are performed in six major firm-related forums hosted on Yahoo Finance over a 3-month period. The relationships between measures extracted from the forums and subsequent daily firm stock returns are examined using multiple linear regression models, revealing statistically significant indicators of firm stock returns in the discussions of the stakeholder groups of each firm with stakeholder-model-adjusted $R^2$ values reaching 0.83. Daily stock return prediction is also performed for 31 trading days, and stakeholder models correctly predicted the direction of return on 67&percnt; of trading days and generated an impressive 17&percnt; return in simulated trading of the six firm stocks. These evaluations demonstrate that the stakeholder analyses provided more refined assessments of the firm-related forums, yielding measures at the stakeholder group level that better explain and predict daily firm stock returns than aggregate forum-level information."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8238","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8238","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8239","fieldValue":"Li, Shing-Han"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8239","fieldValue":"Kao, Yu-Cheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8239","fieldValue":"Zhang, Zong-Cyuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8239","fieldValue":"Chuang, Ying-Ping"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8239","fieldValue":"Yen, David C"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8239","fieldValue":" In today's world, Botnet has become one of the greatest threats to network security. Network attackers, or Botmasters, use Botnet to launch the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) to paralyze large-scale websites or steal confidential data from infected computers. They also employ â\u20ACœphishingâ\u20AC? attacks to steal sensitive information (such as usersâ\u20AC™ accounts and passwords), send bulk email advertising, and\/or conduct click fraud. Even though detection technology has been much improved and some solutions to Internet security have been proposed and improved, the threat of Botnet still exists. Most of the past studies dealing with this issue used either packet contents or traffic flow characteristics to identify the invasion of Botnet. However, there still exist many problems in the areas of packet encryption and data privacy, simply because Botnet can easily change the packet contents and flow characteristics to circumvent the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This study combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and K-means algorithms to provide a solution to remedy those problems and develop, step by step, a mechanism for Botnet detection. First, three important network behaviors are identified: long active communication behavior (ActBehavior), connection failure behavior (FailBehavior), and network scanning behavior (ScanBehavior). These behaviors are defined according to the relevant prior studies and used to analyze the communication activities among the infected computers. Second, the features of network behaviors are extracted from the flow traces in the network layer and transport layer of the network equipment. Third, PSO and K-means techniques are used to uncover the host members of Botnet in the organizational network. This study mainly utilizes the flow traces of a campus network as an experiment. The experimental findings show that this proposed approach can be employed to detect the suspicious Botnet members earlier than the detection application systems. In addition, this proposed approach is easy to implement and can be further used and extended in the campus dormitory network, home networks, and the mobile 3G network."}
