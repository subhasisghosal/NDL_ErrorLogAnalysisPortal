Further, target tracking schemes should consider energy consumption in these resource-constrained networks. In this work, we propose an energy-efficient target tracking algorithm, which minimizes the number of nodes in the network that should be activated for tracking the movement of the target. We model the movement of a target based on the Gauss Markov Mobility Model [Camp et al. 2002]. On detecting a target, the cluster head which detects it activates an optimal number of nodes within its cluster, so that these nodes start sensing the target. A Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based framework is designed to adaptively determine the optimal policy for selecting the nodes localized with each cluster. As the distance between the node and the target decreases, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) increases, thereby increasing the precision of the readings of sensing the target at each node. Simulations show that our proposed algorithm is energy-efficient. Also, the accuracy of the tracked trajectory varies between 50&percnt; to 1&percnt; over time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3038","fieldValue":" The Kurdish language is an Indo-European language spoken in Kurdistan, a large geographical region in the Middle East. Despite having a large number of speakers, Kurdish is among the less-resourced languages and has not seen much attention from the IR and NLP research communities. This article reports on the outcomes of a project aimed at providing essential resources for processing Kurdish texts. A principal output of this project is Pewan, the first standard Test Collection to evaluate Kurdish Information Retrieval systems. The other language resources that we have built include a lightweight stemmer and a list of stopwords. Our second principal contribution is using these newly-built resources to conduct a thorough experimental study on Kurdish documents. Our experimental results show that normalization, and to a lesser extent, stemming, can greatly improve the performance of Kurdish IR systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3038","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3038","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21388","fieldValue":" In this article, we consider the goal of achieving high throughput in a wireless sensor network. Our work is set in the context of those wireless sensor network applications which collect and transfer bulk data. We present PIP (Packets in Pipe), a MAC primitive for use by the transport module to achieve high throughput. PIP has a unique set of features: (a) it is a multihop connection-oriented primitive, (b) it is TDMA based, (c) it uses multiple radio channels, and (d) it is centrally controlled. This represents a significant shift from prior MAC protocols for bulk data transfer. PIP has several desirable properties: (a) its throughput degrades only slightly with increasing number of hops, (b) it is robust to variable wireless error rates, (c) it performs well even without any flow control, and (d) requires only small queue sizes to operate well. We substantiate these properties with a prototype implementation of PIP on the Tmote-Sky CC2420-based platform. PIP achieves about eleven times better throughput than the state-of-the-art prior work, over a network depth of 24 hops. We also show that PIP can be interagted with duty cycling, and that PIP can support streaming data from\/to flash at little overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21388","fieldValue":"MAC"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21388","fieldValue":"TDMA"}
