However, despite the quantum leaps of improvements in cost and performance of individual components over the last decade (e.g., processor speeds, memory\/interconnection bandwidth, etc.), system manufacturers are still struggling to deliver low-latency, highly scalable solutions. One of the main reasons is that the intercommunication latency grows significantly with the number of processor nodes. This article presents a novel way to reduce this intercommunication delay by implementing, in custom hardware, certain communication tasks. In particular, the proposed novel device implements the two most widely used procedures of the most popular communication protocol in parallel systems the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Our novel approach has initially been simulated within a pioneering parallel systems simulation framework and then synthesized directly from a high-level description language (i.e., SystemC) using a state-of-the-art synthesis tool. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article presenting the complete hardware implementation of such a system. The proposed novel approach triggers a speedup from one to four orders of magnitude when compared with conventional software-based solutions and from one to three orders of magnitude when compared with a sophisticated software-based approach. Moreover, the performance of our system is from one to two orders of magnitude higher than the simulated performance of a similar but, relatively simpler hardware architecture; at the same time the power consumption of our device is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of a low-power CPU when executing the exact same intercommunication tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1831","fieldValue":"HPC"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1831","fieldValue":"MPI"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1831","fieldValue":"Significantly reducing MPI intercommunication latency and power overhead in both embedded and HPC systems"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1831","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1831","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9225","fieldValue":"Wan, Peng-Jun"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9225","fieldValue":"Yi, Chih-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9225","fieldValue":" Wieselthier et al. (2000) proposed three greedy heuristics for Min-Power Asymmetric Broadcast Routing: SPT (shortest-path tree), MST (minimum spanning tree), and BIP (broadcasting incremental power). Wan et al. (2001) proved that SPT has an approximation ratio of at least (n2) where n is the total number of nodes, and both MST and BIP have constant approximation ratios. Based on the approach of pruning, Wieselthier et al. also proposed three greedy heuristics for Min-Power Asymmetric Multicast Routing: P-SPT (pruned shortest-path tree), P-MST (pruned minimum spanning tree), and P-BIP (pruned broadcasting incremental power). In this paper, we first prove that the approximation ratios of these three heuristics are at least (n-1\/2), n-1, and n-2-o(1), respectively. We then present constant-approxiation algorithms for Min-Power Asymmetric Multicast Routing. We show that any œ?-approximation Steiner tree algorithm gives rise to cœ?-approximation heuristic for Min-Power Asymmetric Multicast Routing, where c is a constant between 6 and 12. In particular, the Takahashi-Matsuyama Steiner tree heuristic leads to a heuristic called SPF (shortest-path first), which has an approximation ratio of at most 2c. We also present another heuristic, called MIPF (minimum incremental path first), for Min-Power Asymmetric Multicast Routing and show that its approximation ratio is between (13\/3) and 2c. Both SPF and MIPF can be regarded as an adaptation of MST and BIP, respectively, in a different manner than pruning. Finally, we prove that any œ?-approximation Steiner tree algorithm also gives rise to a 2œ?-approximation algorithm for Min-Power Symmetric Multicast Routing."}
