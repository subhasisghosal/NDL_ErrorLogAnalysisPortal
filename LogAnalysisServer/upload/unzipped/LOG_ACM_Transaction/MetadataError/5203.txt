A hierarchical Bayesian model, called Latent Process Decomposition (LPD), is introduced in which each sample in the data set is represented as a combinatorial mixture over a finite set of latent processes, which are expected to correspond to biological processes. Parameters in the model are estimated using efficient variational methods. This type of probabilistic model is most appropriate for the interpretation of measurement data generated by cDNA microarray technology. For determining informative substructure in such data sets, the proposed model has several important advantages over the standard use of dendrograms. First, the ability to objectively assess the optimal number of sample clusters. Second, the ability to represent samples and gene expression levels using a common set of latent variables (dendrograms cluster samples and gene expression values separately which amounts to two distinct reduced space representations). Third, in constrast to standard cluster models, observations are not assigned to a single cluster and, thus, for example, gene expression levels are modeled via combinations of the latent processes identified by the algorithm. We show this new method compares favorably with alternative cluster analysis methods. To illustrate its potential, we apply the proposed technique to several microarray data sets for cancer. For these data sets it successfully decomposes the data into known subtypes and indicates possible further taxonomic subdivision in addition to highlighting, in a wholly unsupervised manner, the importance of certain genes which are known to be medically significant. To illustrate its wider applicability, we also illustrate its performance on a microarray data set for yeast."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4201","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4202","fieldValue":" One of the key components in protein structure prediction by protein threading technique is to choose the best overall template for a given target sequence after all the optimal sequence-template alignments are generated. The chosen template should have the best alignment with the target sequence since the three-dimensional structure of the target sequence is built on the sequence-template alignment. The traditional method for template selection is called Z-score, which uses a statistical test to rank all the sequence-template alignments and then chooses the first-ranked template for the sequence. However, the calculation of Z-score is time-consuming and not suitable for genome-scale structure prediction. Z-scores are also hard to interpret when the threading scoring function is the weighted sum of several energy items of different physical meanings. This paper presents a Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression approach to directly predict the alignment accuracy of a sequence-template alignment, which is used to rank all the templates for a specific target sequence. Experimental results on a large-scale benchmark demonstrate that SVM regression performs much better than the composition-corrected Z-score method. SVM regression also runs much faster than the Z-score method."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4202","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4202","fieldValue":"ACM"}
