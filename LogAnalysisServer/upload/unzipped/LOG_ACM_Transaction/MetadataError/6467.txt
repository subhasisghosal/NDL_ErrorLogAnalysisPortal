We describe a template-based recognition method that simultaneously aligns the input gesture to the templates using a Sequential Monte Carlo inference technique. Contrary to standard template-based methods based on dynamic programming, such as Dynamic Time Warping, the algorithm has an adaptation process that tracks gesture variation in real time. The method continuously updates, during execution of the gesture, the estimated parameters and recognition results, which offers key advantages for continuous human--machine interaction. The technique is evaluated in several different ways: Recognition and early recognition are evaluated on 2D onscreen pen gestures; adaptation is assessed on synthetic data; and both early recognition and adaptation are evaluated in a user study involving 3D free-space gestures. The method is robust to noise, and successfully adapts to parameter variation. Moreover, it performs recognition as well as or better than nonadapting offline template-based methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7207","fieldValue":" Activity recognition, involving a capability to recognize people's behavior and its underlying significance, will play a crucial role in facilitating the integration of interactive robotic artifacts into everyday human environments. In particular, social intelligence in recognizing affectionate behavior will offer value by allowing companion robots to bond meaningfully with interacting persons. The current article addresses the issue of designing an affectionate haptic interaction between a person and a companion robot by exploring how a small humanoid robot can behave to elicit affection while recognizing touches. We report on an experiment conducted to gain insight into how people perceive three fundamental interactive strategies in which a robot is either always highly affectionate, appropriately affectionate, or superficially unaffectionate (emphasizing positivity, contingency, and challenge, respectively). Results provide insight into the structure of affectionate interaction between humans and humanoid robotsâ\u20AC\u201Dunderlining the importance of an interaction design expressing sincere liking, stability and variationâ\u20AC\u201Dand suggest the usefulness of novel modalities such as warmth and cold."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7208","fieldValue":" Smart home environments should proactively support users in their activities, anticipating their needs according to their preferences. Understanding what the user is doing in the environment is important for adapting the environment's behavior, as well as for identifying situations that could be problematic for the user. Enabling the environment to exploit models of the user's most common behaviors is an important step toward this objective. In particular, models of the daily routines of a user can be exploited not only for predicting his\/her needs, but also for comparing the actual situation at a given moment with the expected one, in order to detect anomalies in his\/her behavior. While manually setting up process models in business and factory environments may be cost-effective, building models of the processes involved in people's everyday life is infeasible. This fact fully justifies the interest of the Ambient Intelligence community in automatically learning such models from examples of actual behavior. Incremental adaptation of the models and the ability to express\/learn complex conditions on the involved tasks are also desirable. This article describes how process mining can be used for learning usersâ\u20AC™ daily routines from a dataset of annotated sensor data. The solution that we propose relies on a First-Order Logic learning approach. Indeed, First-Order Logic provides a single, comprehensive and powerful framework for supporting all the previously mentioned features. Our experiments, performed both on a proprietary toy dataset and on publicly available real-world ones, indicate that this approach is efficient and effective for learning and modeling daily routines in Smart Home Environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7208","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7208","fieldValue":"ACM"}
