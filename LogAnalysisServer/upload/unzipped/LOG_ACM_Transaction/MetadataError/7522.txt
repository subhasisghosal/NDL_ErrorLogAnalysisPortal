Recently, STT-RAM has been proposed for L1 caches by relaxing the data retention time to improve write performance and dynamic energy. However, as the technology scales down from 65nm to 22nm, the performance of the read operation scales poorly due to reduced sense margins and sense amplifier delays. In this article, we leverage a dual-mode STT memory cell to design a configurable L1 cache architecture termed C1C to mitigate read performance barriers with technology scaling. Guided by application access characteristics discovered through novel compiler analyses, the proposed cache adaptively switches between a high performance and a low-power access mode. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed cache with compiler guidance outperforms a state-of-the-art STT-RAM cache design by 9&percnt; with high dynamic energy efficiency, leading to significant performance\/watt improvements over several competing approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1893","fieldValue":"STT-RAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9853","fieldValue":" This paper presents an algorithm for maximizing the lifetime of a sensor network while guaranteeing an upper bound on the end-to-end delay. We prove that the proposed algorithm is optimal and requires simple computing operations that can be implemented by simple devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a sensor wake-up frequency that depends on the sensor's location in the routing paths. Using simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm significantly increases the lifetime of the network while guaranteeing a maximum on the end-to-end delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9853","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9853","fieldValue":"An optimal wake-up scheduling algorithm for minimizing energy consumption while limiting maximum delay in a mesh sensor network"}
