{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22387","fieldValue":" Purpose is a key concept in privacy policies. Although some models have been proposed for enforcing purpose-based privacy policies, little has been done in defining formal semantics for purpose, and therefore an effective enforcement mechanism for such policies has remained a challenge. We have developed a framework for expressing and enforcing such policies by giving a formal definition of purpose and proposing a modal-logic language for formally expressing purpose constraints. The semantics of this language are defined over an abstract model of workflows. Based on this formal framework, we discuss some properties of purpose, show how common forms of purpose constraints can be formalized, how purpose-based constraints can be connected to more general access control policies, and how they can be enforced in a workflow-based information system by extending common access control technologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22388","fieldValue":"Corrigan-Gibbs, Henry"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22388","fieldValue":"Weng, Shu-Chun"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22388","fieldValue":" Users often wish to communicate anonymously on the Internet, for example, in group discussion or instant messaging forums. Existing solutions are vulnerable to misbehaving users, however, who may abuse their anonymity to disrupt communication. Dining Cryptographers Networks (DC-nets) leave groups vulnerable to denial-of-service and Sybil attacks; mix networks are difficult to protect against traffic analysis; and accountable voting schemes are unsuited to general anonymous messaging. dissent is the first general protocol offering provable anonymity and accountability for moderate-size groups, while efficiently handling unbalanced communication demands among users. We present an improved and hardened dissent protocol, define its precise security properties, and offer rigorous proofs of these properties. The improved protocol systematically addresses the delicate balance between provably hiding the identities of well-behaved users, while provably revealing the identities of disruptive users, a challenging task because many forms of misbehavior are inherently undetectable. The new protocol also addresses several nontrivial attacks on the original dissent protocol stemming from subtle design flaws."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22388","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22388","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22389","fieldValue":" We describe SpartanRPC, a secure middleware technology that supports cooperation between distinct security domains in wireless sensor networks. SpartanRPC extends nesC to provide a link-layer remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism, along with an enhancement of configuration wirings that allow specification of remote, dynamic endpoints. RPC invocation is secured via an authorization logic that enables servers to specify access policies and requires clients to prove authorization. This mechanism is implemented using a combination of symmetric and public key cryptography. We report on benchmark testing of a prototype implementation and on an application of the framework that supports secure collaborative use and administration of an existing WSN data-gathering system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22389","fieldValue":"ACM"}
