In our system, the user specifies how many coherent layers should be modeled or popped up according to the scene complexity. A coherent layer is defined as a collection of corresponding planar regions in the light field images. A coherent layer can be rendered free of aliasing all by itself, or against other background layers. To construct coherent layers, we introduce a Bayesian approach, coherence matting, to estimate alpha matting around segmented layer boundaries by incorporating a coherence prior in order to maintain coherence across images.We have developed an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface (UI) to facilitate pop-up light field construction. The key to our UI is the concept of human-in-the-loop where the user specifies where aliasing occurs in the rendered image. The user input is reflected in the input light field images where pop-up layers can be modified. The user feedback is instant through a hardware-accelerated real-time pop-up light field renderer. Experimental results demonstrate that our system is capable of rendering anti-aliased novel views from a sparse light field."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15493","fieldValue":" In the past twenty years, many algorithms have been proposed to compute global illumination in synthetic scenes. Typically, such approaches can deal with specific lighting configurations, but often have difficulties with others. In this article, we present a final reconstruction step for a novel unified approach to global illumination that automatically detects different types of light transfer and uses the appropriate method in a closely-integrated manner. With our approach, we can deal with difficult lighting configurations such as indirect nondiffuse illumination. The first step of this algorithm consists in a view-independent solution based on hierarchical radiosity with clustering, integrated with particle tracing. This first pass results in solutions containing directional effects such as caustics, which can be interactively rendered. The second step consists of a view-dependent final reconstruction that uses all existing information to compute higher quality, ray-traced images."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15493","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15493","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2468","fieldValue":" An (Î±, Î²)-spanner of an unweighted graph G is a subgraph H that distorts distances in G up to a multiplicative factor of Î± and an additive term Î². It is well known that any graph contains a (multiplicative) (2kâˆ\u20191, 0)-spanner of size $O(n^1+1\/k) and an (additive) (1,2)-spanner of size O(n3\/2). However no other additive spanners are known to exist. In this article we develop a couple of new techniques for constructing (Î±, Î²)-spanners. Our first result is an additive (1,6)-spanner of size O(n4\/3). The construction algorithm can be understood as an economical agent that assigns costs and values to paths in the graph, purchasing affordable paths and ignoring expensive ones, which are intuitively well approximated by paths already purchased. We show that this path buying algorithm can be parameterized in different ways to yield other sparseness-distortion tradeoffs. Our second result addresses the problem of which (Î±, Î²)-spanners can be computed efficiently, ideally in linear time. We show that, for any k, a (k,kâˆ\u20191)-spanner with size O(kn1+1\/k$) can be found in linear time, and, further, that in a distributed network the algorithm terminates in a constant number of rounds. Previous spanner constructions with similar performance had roughly twice the multiplicative distortion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2468","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2468","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15494","fieldValue":" Many high-resolution surfaces are created through isosurface extraction from volumetric representations, obtained by 3D photography, CT, or MRI. Noise inherent in the acquisition process can lead to geometrical and topological errors. Reducing geometrical errors during reconstruction is well studied. However, isosurfaces often contain many topological errors in the form of tiny handles. These nearly invisible artifacts hinder subsequent operations like mesh simplification, remeshing, and parametrization. In this article we present a practical method for removing handles in an isosurface. Our algorithm makes an axis-aligned sweep through the volume to locate handles, compute their sizes, and selectively remove them. The algorithm is designed to facilitate out-of-core execution. It finds the handles by incrementally constructing and analyzing a Reeb graph. The size of a handle is measured by a short nonseparating cycle. Handles are removed robustly by modifying the volume rather than attempting \"mesh surgery.\" Finally, the volumetric modifications are spatially localized to preserve geometrical detail. We demonstrate topology simplification on several complex models, and show its benefits for subsequent surface processing."}
