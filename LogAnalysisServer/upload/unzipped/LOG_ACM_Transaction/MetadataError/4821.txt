A comparison of GP-based classification with classical classifiers including support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, na√Øve Bayes, and random forest is conducted. In addition, the use of GP in discovering small knowledge-preserving subsets of features in high-dimensional datasets of haptic-based signatures is investigated and several approaches are explored. Subsets of features extracted from GP-generated models (analytic functions) are also exploited to determine the importance and relevance of different haptic data types (e.g., force, position, torque, and orientation) in user identity verification. The results revealed that GP classifiers compare favorably with the classical methods and use a much fewer number of attributes (with simple function sets)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/25493","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2457450.2457453\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25493","fieldValue":"Identity verification based on handwritten signatures with haptic information using genetic programming"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25493","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25493","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25494","fieldValue":" This article introduces an image classification approach in which the semantic context of images and multiple low-level visual features are jointly exploited. The context consists of a set of semantic terms defining the classes to be associated to unclassified images. Initially, a multiobjective optimization technique is used to define a multifeature fusion model for each semantic class. Then, a Bayesian learning procedure is applied to derive a context model representing relationships among semantic classes. Finally, this context model is used to infer object classes within images. Selected results from a comprehensive experimental evaluation are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/25494","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2457450.2457454\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25494","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25494","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25495","fieldValue":" User interactions such as seeks and pauses are widely supported by existing Peer-to-Peer Video-on-Demand (P2P VoD) streaming systems. Their effect on the streaming system, however, has not been well studied. Seeks cause peers to skip part of the video, making them stay in the system for shorter time, and thus contribute less. On the other hand, only part of the video is downloaded due to seeks, reducing peers' demand from the system. It is unclear which factor dominates the effect of seeks on the streaming system. Pauses during playback, on one hand, allow peers to stay longer in the system and upload more content. When interleaved with seeks, however, long pauses may increase peers' demand unnecessarily as peers may download content that will eventually be skipped by subsequent forward seeks. The collective effect of seeks and pauses, together with the known random peer departure, is unintuitive and needs to be addressed properly so as to understand the effect of human factors on the streaming system performance. In this article, we develop an analytical model to both qualitatively and quantitatively study the effect of seeks and pauses on mesh-based P2P VoD streaming systems, in particular, the effect on the server cost. Our model can help in understanding how human factors such as seeks and pauses affect the streaming system performance, tuning a P2P VoD system towards better system performance and stability, and providing a framework for capacity planning."}
