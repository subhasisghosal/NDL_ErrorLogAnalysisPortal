Most layout problems are either intractable or not known to be tractable, parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. We investigate MLA with respect to three parameters that provide more structure than treewidth. In particular, we give a factor (1 + &epsiv;)-approximation algorithm for MLA parameterized by (&epsiv;, k), where k is the vertex cover number of the input graph. By a similar approach, we obtain two FPT algorithms that exactly solve MLA parameterized by, respectively, the max leaf and edge clique cover numbers of the input graph."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12548","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12548","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12549","fieldValue":" The standard definition of property testing endows the tester with the ability to make arbitrary queries to â\u20ACœelementsâ\u20AC? of the tested object. In contrast, sample-based testers only obtain independently distributed elements (a.k.a. labeled samples) of the tested object. While sample-based testers were defined by Goldreich, Goldwasser, and Ron (JACM 1998), with few exceptions, most research in property testing has focused on query-based testers. In this work, we advance the study of sample-based property testers by providing several general positive results as well as by revealing relations between variants of this testing model. In particular: â\u20AC\u201DWe show that certain types of query-based testers yield sample-based testers of sublinear sample complexity. For example, this holds for a natural class of proximity oblivious testers. â\u20AC\u201DWe study the relation between distribution-free sample-based testers and one-sided error sample-based testers w.r.t. the uniform distribution. While most of this work ignores the time complexity of testing, one part of it does focus on this aspect. The main result in this part is a sublinear-time sample-based tester, in the dense graphs model, for k-colorability, for any k &ges; 2."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12549","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12549","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12550","fieldValue":" We introduce the polynomial coefficient matrix and identify the maximum rank of this matrix under variable substitution as a complexity measure for multivariate polynomials. We use our techniques to prove super-polynomial lower bounds against several classes of non-multilinear arithmetic circuits. In particular, we obtain the following results: â\u20AC\u201DAs our first main result, we prove that any homogeneous depth-3 circuit for computing the product of d matrices of dimension n Ã\u2014 n requires $Î©(n^d âˆ\u2019 1\/2d) size. This improves the lower bounds in Nisan and Wigderson [1995] for d &equals; Ï\u2030(1). â\u20AC\u201DAs our second main result, we show that there is an explicit polynomial on n variables and degree at most n\/2 for which any depth-3 circuit of product dimension at most n\/10 (dimension of the space of affine forms feeding into each product gate) requires size 2Î©(n). This generalizes the lower bounds against diagonal circuits proved in Saxena [2008]. Diagonal circuits are of product dimension 1. â\u20AC\u201DWe prove a nÎ©(log n) lower bound on the size of product-sparse formulas. By definition, any multilinear formula is a product-sparse formula. Thus, this result extends the known super-polynomial lower bounds on the size of multilinear formulas [Raz 2006]. â\u20AC\u201DWe prove a 2Î©(n)$ lower bound on the size of partitioned arithmetic branching programs. This result extends the known exponential lower bound on the size of ordered arithmetic branching programs [Jansen 2008]."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12550","fieldValue":"ACM"}
