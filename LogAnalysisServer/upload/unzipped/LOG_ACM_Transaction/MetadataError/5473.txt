Classical side-chain packing methods consist of two steps: first, side-chain conformations, known as rotamers, are extracted from known protein structures as candidates for each residue; second, a searching method along with an energy function is used to resolve conflicts among residues and to optimize the combinations of side chain conformations for all residues. These methods benefit from the fact that the number of possible side-chain conformations is limited, and the rotamer candidates are readily extracted; however, these methods also suffer from the inaccuracy of energy functions. Inspired by threading and Ab Initio approaches to protein structure prediction, we propose to use hexagon substructures to implicitly capture subtle issues of energy functions. Our initial results indicate that even without guidance from an energy function, hexagon structures alone can capture side-chain conformations at an accuracy of 83.8 percent, higher than 82.6 percent by the state-of-art side-chain packing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4710","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4711","fieldValue":" Availability of an effective tool for protein multiple structural alignment (MSTA) is essential for discovery and analysis of biologically significant structural motifs that can help solve functional annotation and drug design problems. Existing MSTA methods collect residue correspondences mostly through pairwise comparison of consecutive fragments, which can lead to suboptimal alignments, especially when the similarity among the proteins is low. We introduce a novel strategy based on: building a contact-window based motif library from the protein structural data, discovery and extension of common alignment seeds from this library, and optimal superimposition of multiple structures according to these alignment seeds by an enhanced partial order curve comparison method. The ability of our strategy to detect multiple correspondences simultaneously, to catch alignments globally, and to support flexible alignments, endorse a sensitive and robust automated algorithm that can expose similarities among protein structures even under low similarity conditions. Our method yields better alignment results compared to other popular MSTA methods, on several protein structure data sets that span various structural folds and represent different protein similarity levels. A web-based alignment tool, a downloadable executable, and detailed alignment results for the data sets used here are available at http:\/\/sacan.biomed. drexel.edu\/Smolign and http:\/\/bio.cse.ohio-state.edu\/Smolign."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4711","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
