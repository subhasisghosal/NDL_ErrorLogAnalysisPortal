A large part of the energy consumed goes to wireless communication. In this article, we first study the energy efficiency of different video content delivery strategies used by service providers and identify a number of sources of energy inefficiency. Specifically, we find a fundamental tradeoff in energy waste between prefetching small and large chunks of video content: small chunks are bad because each download causes a fixed tail energy to be spent regardless of the amount of content downloaded, whereas large chunks increase the risk of downloading data that user will never view because of abandoning the video. Hence, the key to optimal strategy lies in the ability to predict when the user might abandon viewing prematurely. We then propose an algorithm called eSchedule that uses viewing statistics to predict viewer behavior and computes an energy optimal download strategy for a given mobile client. The algorithm also includes a mechanism for explicit control of traffic overhead, i.e., unnecessary download of content that the user will never watch. Our evaluation results suggest that the algorithm can cut the energy waste down to less than half compared to other strategies. We also present and experiment with an Android prototype that integrates eSchedule into a YouTube downloader."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10908","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10908","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10908","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10908","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10909","fieldValue":" Opportunistic scheduling of delay-tolerant traffic has been shown to substantially improve spectrum efficiency. To encourage users to adopt delay-tolerant scheduling for capacity-improvement, it is critical to provide guarantees in terms of completion time. In this paper, we study application-level scheduling with deadline constraints, where the deadline is pre-specified by users\/applications and is associated with a deadline violation probability. To address the exponentially-high complexity due to temporally-varying channel conditions and deadline constraints, we develop a novel asymptotic approach that exploits the largeness of the network to our advantage. Specifically, we identify a lower bound on the deadline violation probability, and propose simple policies that achieve the lower bound in the large-system regime. The results in this paper thus provide a rigorous analytical framework to develop and analyze policies for application-level scheduling under very general settings of channel models and deadline requirements. Further, based on the asymptotic approach, we propose the notion of Application-Level Effective Capacity region, i.e., the throughput region that can be supported subject to deadline constraints, which allows us to quantify the potential gain of application-level scheduling. Simulation results show that application-level scheduling can improve the system capacity significantly while guaranteeing the deadline constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10909","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10909","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10909","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10909","fieldValue":"ACM"}
