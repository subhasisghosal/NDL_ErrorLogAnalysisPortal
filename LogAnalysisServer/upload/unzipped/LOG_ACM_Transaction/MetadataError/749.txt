In this article, we first develop an efficient non-Monte-Carlo (NMC) transient mismatch analysis, where transient response is represented by stochastic orthogonal polynomial (SOP) expansion under PVT variations and probabilistic distribution of transient response is solved. We further define performance yield and derive stochastic sensitivity for yield within the framework of SOP, and finally develop a gradient-based multiobjective optimization to improve yield while satisfying other performance constraints. Extensive experiments show that compared to Monte Carlo-based yield estimation, our NMC method achieves up to 700X speedup and maintains 98&percnt; accuracy. Furthermore, multiobjective optimization not only improves yield by up to 95.3&percnt; with performance constraints, it also provides better efficiency than other existing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13254","fieldValue":"Wu, Meng-Huan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13254","fieldValue":"Wang, Peng-Chih"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13254","fieldValue":"Fu, Cheng-Yang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13254","fieldValue":"Tsay, Ren-Song"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13254","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose an extended SystemC framework that directly enables software simulation in SystemC. Although SystemC has been widely adopted for system-level simulation of hardware designs nowadays, to complete HW\/SW co-simulation, it still requires an additional instruction set simulator (ISS) for software execution. However, the heavy intercommunication overheads between the two heterogeneous simulators would significantly slow down simulation performance. To deal with this issue, our proposed approach automatically generates high-speed and equivalent SystemC models for target software applications that can be directly integrated with hardware models for complete HW\/SW co-simulation. In addition, to properly handle multitasking, an efficient OS model is devised to support accurate preemptive scheduling. Since both the generated application model and the OS model are constructed in SystemC modules, our approach avoids heavy intercommunication overheads and achieves over 1,000 times faster simulation than that of the conventional ISS-SystemC approach. Experimental results demonstrate that our extended SystemC approach can perform at 50 to 220 MIPS while offering accurate simulation results."}
