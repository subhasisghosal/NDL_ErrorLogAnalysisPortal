Based on this algorithm, a network for performing multiplications of two's complement numbers is proposed. The network can be implemented in a synchronous or an asynchronous way. If the factors to be multiplied have N bits, the area complexity of the network is O(N2) for practical values of N as in the case of cellular multipliers. Due to the design approach based on a recursive algorithm, a time complexity O(log N) is achieved.It is shown how the structure can he pipelined with period complexity O(1) and used for single and double precision multiplication."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12028","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12028","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12029","fieldValue":"Chow, Ching-Hua"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12029","fieldValue":" Many communication protocols can be observed to go through different phases performing a distinct function in each phase. A multiphase model for such protocols is presented. A phase is formally defined to be a network of communicating finite-state machines with certain desirable correctness properties; these include proper termination and freedom from deadlocks and unspecified receptions. A multifunction protocol is constructed by first constructing separate phases to perform its different functions. It is shown how to connect these phases together to realize the multifunction protocol so that the resulting network of communicating finite state machines is also a phase (i.e., it possesses the desirable properties defined for phases). The modularity inherent in multiphase protocols facilitates not only their construction but also their understanding and modification. An abundance of protocols have been found in the literature that can be constructed as multiphase protocols. Three examples are presented here: two versions of IBM's BSC protocol for data link control and a token ring network protocol."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12030","fieldValue":" A distributed algorithm is presented that realizes mutual exclusion among N nodes in a computer network. The algorithm requires at most N message exchanges for one mutual exclusion invocation. Accordingly, the delay to invoke mutual exclusion is smaller than in an algorithm of Ricart and Agrawala, which requires 2*(N - 1) message exchanges per invocation. A drawback of the algorithm is that the sequence numbers contained in the messages are unbounded. It is shown that this problem can be overcome by slightly increasing the number of message exchanges."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12030","fieldValue":"ACM"}
