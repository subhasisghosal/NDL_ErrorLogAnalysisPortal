At each node u, for every other node t, the algorithm independently and iteratively updates the fraction of traffic destined to t that leaves u on each of its outgoing links. At each iteration, the updates are calculated based on the shortest path to each destination as determined by the marginal costs of the network's links. The marginal link costs used to find the shortest paths are in turn obtained from link-state updates that are flooded through the network after each iteration. For stationary input traffic, we prove that HALO converges to the routing assignment that minimizes the cost of the network. Furthermore, we observe that our technique is adaptive, automatically converging to the new optimal routing assignment for quasi-static network changes. We also report numerical and experimental evaluations to confirm our theoretical predictions, explore additional aspects of the solution, and outline a proof-of-concept implementation of HALO."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10835","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10835","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10835","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10836","fieldValue":"Hsu, Yu-Pin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10836","fieldValue":" It has been well established that wireless network coding can significantly improve the efficiency of multihop wireless networks. However, in a stochastic environment, some of the packets might not have coding pairs, which limits the number of available coding opportunities. In this context, an important decision is whether to delay packet transmission in hope that a coding pair will be available in the future or transmit a packet without coding. This paper addresses this problem by establishing a stochastic dynamic framework whose objective is to minimize a long-run average cost. We identify an optimal control policy that minimizes the costs due to a combination of transmissions and packet delays. We show that the optimal policy would be stationary, deterministic, and threshold-type based on queue lengths. Our analytical approach is applicable for many cases of interest such as time-varying ON\/OFF channels. We further substantiate our results with simulation experiments for more generalized settings."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10836","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10837","fieldValue":" We study the Relay-based Cooperative Data Exchange (RCDE) problem, where initially each client has access to a subset of a set of n original packets, referred to as their side information, and wants to retrieve all other original packets via co-operation. Unlike traditional Cooperative Data Exchange (CDE), in our proposed relay-based model, clients can only cooperate via a relay. The data exchange is completed over two phases, namely Uploading Phase and Downloading Phase. In the Uploading Phase, the clients will encode the original packets and transmit the coded packets to the relay. In the Downloading Phase, the relay will reencode the received packets and multicast the reencoded packets, each to a subgroup of clients. The coded packets in the two phases are carefully selected so that each client can retrieve all original packets with minimum total transmission delay, based on its initial side information and on the coded packets it receives from the relay. In addition, we assume that the bandwidths between the relay and different clients are different, and that the upload\/download bandwidths between the relay and the same client are also different. We establish a coding scheme that has the minimum total delay and show that it can be found in polynomial time, for sufficiently large underlying fields. We also design a heuristic algorithm that has a low complexity with binary field size. Our simulations show that the performance of the binary solution is very close to that of the optimal solution. All coding schemes considered in this work are scalar."}
