However, accessing large hardware structures typically required to buffer and process such instruction window sizes significantly degrade the cycle time. This paper proposes a novel checkpoint processing and recovery (CPR) microarchitecture, and shows how to implement a large instruction window processor without requiring large structures thus permitting a high clock frequency.We focus on four critical aspects of a microarchitecture: (1) scheduling instructions, (2) recovering from branch mispredicts, (3) buffering a large number of stores and forwarding data from stores to any dependent load, and (4) reclaiming physical registers. While scheduling window size is important, we show the performance of large instruction windows to be more sensitive to the other three design issues. Our CPR proposal incorporates novel microarchitectural schemes for addressing these design issues---a selective checkpoint mechanism for recovering from mispredicts, a hierarchical store queue organization for fast store-load forwarding, and an effective algorithm for aggressive physical register reclamation. Our proposals allow a processor to realize performance gains due to instruction windows of thousands of instructions without requiring large cycle-critical hardware structures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1602","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1602","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6557","fieldValue":"Hanson, Mark A"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6557","fieldValue":"Powell, Harry C"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6557","fieldValue":"Barth, Adam T"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6557","fieldValue":" Energy-fidelity trade-offs are central to the performance of many technologies, but they are essential in wireless body area sensor networks (BASNs) due to severe energy and processing constraints and the critical nature of certain healthcare applications. On-node signal processing and compression techniques can save energy by greatly reducing the amount of data transmitted over the wireless channel, but lossy techniques, capable of high compression ratios, can incur a reduction in application fidelity. In order to maximize system performance, these trade-offs must be considered at runtime due to the dynamic nature of BASN applications, including sensed data, operating environments, user actuation, etc. BASNs therefore require energy-fidelity scalability, so automated and user-initiated trade-offs can be made dynamically. This article presents a data rate scalability framework within a motion-based health application context which demonstrates the design of efficient and efficacious wireless health systems."}
