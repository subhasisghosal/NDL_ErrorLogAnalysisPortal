Having geo-tagged user posts on the microblogging service of Twitter as our input data, we investigate two case studies. The first consists of a benchmark problem, where actual levels of rainfall in a given location and time are inferred from the content of tweets. The second one is a real-life task, where we infer regional Influenza-like Illness rates in the effort of detecting timely an emerging epidemic disease. Our analysis builds on a statistical learning framework, which performs sparse learning via the bootstrapped version of LASSO to select a consistent subset of textual features from a large amount of candidates. In both case studies, selected features indicate close semantic correlation with the target topics and inference, conducted by regression, has a significant performance, especially given the short length --approximately one year-- of Twitterâ\u20AC™s data time series."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7437","fieldValue":"LASSO"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7438","fieldValue":"Yang, Christopher C"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7438","fieldValue":" Due to the revolutionary development of Web 2.0 technology, individual users have become major contributors of Web content in online social media. In light of the growing activities, how to measure a userâ\u20AC™s influence to other users in online social media becomes increasingly important. This research need is urgent especially in the online healthcare community since positive influence can be beneficial while negative influence may cause-negative impact on other users of the same community. In this article, a research framework was proposed to study user influence within the online healthcare community. We proposed a new approach to incorporate usersâ\u20AC™ reply relationship, conversation content and response immediacy which capture both explicit and implicit interaction between users to identify influential users of online healthcare community. A weighted social network is developed to represent the influence between users. We tested our proposed techniques thoroughly on two medical support forums. Two algorithms UserRank and Weighted in-degree are benchmarked with PageRank and in-degree. Experiment results demonstrated the validity and effectiveness of our proposed approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7438","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7438","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7439","fieldValue":" Algorithms for constructing hierarchical structures from user-generated metadata have caught the interest of the academic community in recent years. In social tagging systems, the output of these algorithms is usually referred to as folksonomies (from folk-generated taxonomies). Evaluation of folksonomies and folksonomy induction algorithms is a challenging issue complicated by the lack of golden standards, lack of comprehensive methods and tools as well as a lack of research and empirical\/simulation studies applying these methods. In this article, we report results from a broad comparative study of state-of-the-art folksonomy induction algorithms that we have applied and evaluated in the context of five social tagging systems. In addition to adopting semantic evaluation techniques, we present and adopt a new technique that can be used to evaluate the usefulness of folksonomies for navigation. Our work sheds new light on the properties and characteristics of state-of-the-art folksonomy induction algorithms and introduces a new pragmatic approach to folksonomy evaluation, while at the same time identifying some important limitations and challenges of folksonomy evaluation. Our results show that folksonomy induction algorithms specifically developed to capture intuitions of social tagging systems outperform traditional hierarchical clustering techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the largest and most comprehensive evaluation study of state-of-the-art folksonomy induction algorithms to date."}
