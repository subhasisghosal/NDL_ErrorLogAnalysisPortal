Methodology is developed here that enables estimation of the A\/M rates, in spite of having only indirect data of this nature. Both parametric and nonparametric methods are developed. Theoretical and empirical analyses are presented that indicate that the problem is indeed statistically tractable, and that the methods developed are of practical value. Behavior of the parametric estimators is examined when these assumptions are violated, and these estimators are found to be robust against some such violations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24910","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24910","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24911","fieldValue":" We define a new methodology, aesthetic computing, for customizing discrete structures found in mathematics, programming, and computer simulation. The methodology is presented as a procedure, defined within the context of the semantic web, involving a successive chain of model transformations from a source model to a target model, with the source model being the discrete structure to represent and the target model being the geometric model. We also present an implementation based on this methodology, and a class where empirical studies were performed to assess student perceptions on how customized model structures affected their understanding and preferences regarding visual and interactive model representations. Students appear to prefer the methodology as a way to inject creativity into model building, and to allow them to explore alternative, analogical representations influenced by the fields of aesthetics and the arts."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24911","fieldValue":"RUBE"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24911","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24911","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24912","fieldValue":" Consider a Jackson network that allows feedback and that has a single server at each queue. The queues in this network are classified as a single â\u20AC˜targetâ\u20AC™ queue and the remaining â\u20AC˜feederâ\u20AC™ queues. In this setting we develop the large deviations limit and an asymptotically efficient importance sampling estimator for the probability that the target queue overflows during its busy period, under some regularity conditions on the feeder queue-length distribution at the initiation of the target queue busy period. This importance sampling distribution is obtained as a solution to a non-linear program. We especially focus on the case where the feeder queues, at the initiation of the target queue busy period, have the steady state distribution corresponding to these instants. In this setting, we explicitly identify the importance sampling distribution when the feeder queue service rates exceed a specified threshold. We also relate our work to the existing large deviations literature to develop a perspective on successes and limitations of our results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24912","fieldValue":"ACM"}
