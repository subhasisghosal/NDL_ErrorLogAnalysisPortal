Formally, given a metric space on n vertices V, with m demand pairs ‚ä\u2020 V √\u2014 V and a ‚\u20ACútarget‚\u20AC? k‚\u2030§ m, the goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph that connects at least k pairs. In this paper, we give an O(min{&sqrt;n·π°log k,&sqrt;k})-approximation algorithm for k-forest, improving on the previous best ratio of O(min ${n^2\/3,&sqrt;m}log n) by Segev and Segev. We then apply our algsorithm for k-forest to obtain approximation algorithms for several Dial-a-Ride problems. The basic Dial-a-Ride problem is the following: given an n point metric space with m objects each with its own source and destination, and a vehicle capable of carrying at most k objects at any time, find the minimum length tour that uses this vehicle to move each object from its source to destination. We want that the tour be non-preemptive: that is, each object, once picked up at its source, is dropped only at its destination. We prove that an Œ±-approximation algorithm for the k-forest problem implies an O(Œ±·π°log2n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. Using our results for k-forest, we get an O(min{&sqrt;n,&sqrt;k}·π°log2$ n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. The only previous result known for Dial-a-Ride was an O(&sqrt;klog n)-approximation by Charikar and Raghavachari; our results give a different proof of a similar approximation guarantee‚\u20AC\u201Din fact, when the vehicle capacity k is large, we give a slight improvement on their results. The reduction from Dial-a-Ride to the k-forest problem is fairly robust, and allows us to obtain approximation algorithms (with the same guarantee) for some interesting generalizations of Dial-a-Ride."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2432","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2432","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15137","fieldValue":" The orientation, or pose, of an object is a fundamental property that helps to define the geometrical relationship between the object and its environment. In addition, knowledge of object orientation can also facilitate interpretive and decision-making tasks in a variety of practical domains, including industrial, meteorological, and medical applications. Determining object pose, however, remains an open research question in the fields of graphics and visualization. This article describes a novel yet intuitively simple approach, which we call topological goniometry, to directly determine the pose of a three-dimensional object from 3D data. The topology of interest is that of two-sided surfaces in a three-manifold, and includes objects whose shaped are unaffected by elastic transformations. Algorithmically, topological goniometry is composed of the following major steps. The first analyzes the global topology in order to generate a distribution of 3D coordinate triplets in the proximity of the desired pose axis. Using this set of 3D points, that second step then invokes a ‚\u20ACú3D Walk‚\u20AC? algorithm that considers the local topology to produce a generalized curve representing an estimate of the object's axis of pose. The resultant pose axis is thus not constrained to lie along a straight line but can be generalized 3D curve. The methods are illustrated with a variety of synthetically created models that exhibit duct-like shapes, and are further tested by introducting noise as well as deformations to these models. The approach is also applied to a number of real discrete data obtained from meteorological and medical domains. The results suggest that the appproach is applicable to both real and synthetic datasets and is shown to be robust, computationally efficient, and applicable to a variety of problems. The approach can incorporate context- or application-dependent information about the object of interest by using a set of constraints that guide the process of orientation determination. This article describes the approach, its implementation, and the results obtained with numerous applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15137","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15137","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15138","fieldValue":" This article concerns the benefits of presenting abstract data in 3D. Two experiments show that motion cues combined with stereo viewing can substantially increase the size of the graph that can be preceived. The first experiment was designed to provide quantitiative measurements of how much more (or less) can be understood in 3D than in 2D. The 3D display used was configured so that the image on the monitor was coupled to the user's actual eye positons (and it was updated in real-time as the user moved) as well as bring in stereo. Thus the effect was like a local ‚\u20ACúvirtual reality‚\u20AC? display located in the vicinity of the computer monitor. The results from this study show that head-coupled stereo viewing can increase the size of an abstract graph that can be understood by a factor of three; using stereo alone provided an increase by a factor of 1.6 and head coupling along produced an increase by a factor of 2.2. The second experiment examined a variety of motion cues provided by head-coupled perspective (as in virtual reality displays), head-guided motion and automatic rotation, respectively, both with and without stereo in each case. The results show that structured 3D motion and stereo viewing both help in understanding, but that the kind of motion is not particularly important; all improve performance, and all are more significant than stereo cues. These results provide strong reasons for using advanced 3D graphics for interacting with a large variety of information structures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15138","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15138","fieldValue":"ACM"}
