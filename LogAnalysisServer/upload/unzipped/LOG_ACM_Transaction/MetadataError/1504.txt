Most traditional approaches to this problem have emphasized precise control over the deformation being made. However, they are often cumbersome and unintuitive for non-expert users.In this paper, we present an interactive system for deforming unstructured polygon meshes that is very easy to use. The user interacts with the system by sketching curves in the image plane. A single stroke can define a free-form skeleton and the region of the model to be deformed. By sketching the desired deformation of this reference curve, the user can implicitly and intuitively control the deformation of an entire region of the surface. At the same time, the reference curve also provides a basis for controlling additional parameters, such as twist and scaling. We demonstrate that our system can be used to interactively edit a variety of unstructured mesh models with very little effort. Furthermore, we can also use our formulation of the deformation to achieve a natural interpolation between character poses, thus producing simple key framed animations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15581","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15581","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15582","fieldValue":"Comba, Joo L D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15582","fieldValue":" We present a technique for mapping relief textures onto arbitrary polygonal models in real time, producing correct self-occlusions, interpenetrations, shadows and per-pixel lighting. The technique uses a pixel-driven formulation based on an efficient ray-height-field intersection implemented on the GPU. It has very low memory requirements, supports extreme close-up views of the surfaces and can be applicable to surfaces undergoing deformation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15582","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15582","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15583","fieldValue":" Forward dynamics is central to physically-based simulation and control of articulated bodies. We present an adaptive algorithm for computing forward dynamics of articulated bodies: using novel motion error metrics, our algorithm can automatically simplify the dynamics of a multi-body system, based on the desired number of degrees of freedom and the location of external forces and active joint forces. We demonstrate this method in plausible animation of articulated bodies, including a large-scale simulation of 200 animated humanoids and multi-body dynamics systems with many degrees of freedom. The graceful simplification allows us to achieve up to two orders of magnitude performance improvement in several complex benchmarks."}
