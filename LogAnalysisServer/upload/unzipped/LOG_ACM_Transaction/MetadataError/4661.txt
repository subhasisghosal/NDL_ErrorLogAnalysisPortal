{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25044","fieldValue":" Cell-based methods for simulating wildfires can be computationally more efficient than techniques based on the fire perimeter expansion. In spite of this, their success has been limited by the distortions that plague the simulated shapes. This article presents a novel algorithm for wildfire simulation through Cellular Automata (CA), which is able to effectively mitigate the problem of distorted fire shapes. Such a result is obtained allowing spread directions that are not constrained to the few angles imposed by the lattice of cells and the neighborhood size. The characteristics of the proposed algorithm are empirically investigated under homogeneous conditions through some comparisons with the outcomes of a typical CA-based simulator. Also, using two significant heterogeneous landscapes, a comparison with the vector-based simulator FARSITE is discussed. According to the results of this study, the proposed approach performs significantly better, in terms of accuracy, than the CA taken as reference. In addition, at a far less computational cost, it provides burned regions that are equivalent, for practical purposes, to those given by FARSITE."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25045","fieldValue":" Ankenman et al. introduced stochastic kriging as a metamodeling tool for representing stochastic simulation response surfaces, and employed a very simple example to suggest that the use of Common Random Numbers (CRN) degrades the capability of stochastic kriging to predict the true response surface. In this article we undertake an in-depth analysis of the interaction between CRN and stochastic kriging by analyzing a richer collection of models; in particular, we consider stochastic kriging models with a linear trend term. We also perform an empirical study of the effect of CRN on stochastic kriging. We also consider the effect of CRN on metamodel parameter estimation and response-surface gradient estimation, as well as response-surface prediction. In brief, we confirm that CRN is detrimental to prediction, but show that it leads to better estimation of slope parameters and superior gradient estimation compared to independent simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25046","fieldValue":" State-dependent importance sampling algorithms based on mixtures are considered. The algorithms are designed to compute tail probabilities of a heavy-tailed random walk. The increments of the random walk are assumed to have a regularly varying distribution. Sufficient conditions for obtaining bounded relative error are presented for rather general mixture algorithms. Two new examples, called the generalized Pareto mixture and the scaling mixture, are introduced. Both examples have good asymptotic properties and, in contrast to some of the existing algorithms, they are very easy to implement. Their performance is illustrated by numerical experiments. Finally, it is proved that mixture algorithms of this kind can be designed to have vanishing relative error."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25046","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25046","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25047","fieldValue":"De Rainville, Franois-Michel"}
