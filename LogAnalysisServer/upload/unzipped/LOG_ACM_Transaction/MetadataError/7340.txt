The key idea underlying ISCOD is the joint exploitation of the data blocks already cached by each client, the server's full knowledge of client-cache contents and client requests, and the fact that each client only needs to be able to derive the blocks requested by it rather than all the blocks ever transmitted or even the union of the blocks requested by the different clients. We present two-phase ISCOD algorithms: the server first creates ad-hoc error-correction sets based on its knowledge of client states; next, it uses erasure-correction codes to construct the data for transmission. Each client uses its cached data and the received supplemental data to derive its requested blocks. The result is up to a several-fold reduction in the amount of transmitted supplemental data. Also, we define k-partial cliques in a directed graph and cast ISCOD in terms of partial-clique covers."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9492","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9492","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/9492","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-partial clique"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9492","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-partial clique"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9492","fieldValue":"Coding on demand by an informed source (ISCOD) for efficient broadcast of different supplemental data to caching clients"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9493","fieldValue":" This correspondence considers networks where nodes are connected randomly and can fail at random times. It provides scaling laws that allow to find the critical time at which isolated nodes begin to appear in the system as its size tends to infinity. Applications are in the areas of sensor and ad-hoc networks where nodes are subject to battery drainage and 'blind spots' formation becomes a primary concern. The techniques adopted are based on the Chen-Stein method of Poisson approximation, which allows to obtain elegant derivations that are shown to improve upon and simplify previous related results that appeared in the literature. Since blind spots are strongly related to full connectivity, we also obtain some scaling results about the latter."}
