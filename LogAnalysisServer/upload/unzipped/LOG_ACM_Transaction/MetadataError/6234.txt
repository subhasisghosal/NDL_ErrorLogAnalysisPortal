In this article, we propose a data hiding system by means of flexible exploiting modification directions to achieve safer message concealments in image-media. In our scheme, n cover-pixels are flexibly chosen on modulo operations to embed a secret s, where n = ‚åà $log_3$(s) ‚å\u2030. The varied pixel values associated with the chosen n pixels are only changed among [-1, 1]. Because the numbers of adjustable pixels are much greater than the pixels in the past scheme, our scheme is able to obtain a higher embedded ratio in response to the capacity requirements of information hiding systems. In addition, we also applied the statistics-steganalyzers to demonstrate that our scheme has accomplishment not only higher capacity but also kept the robustness against the blind steganalyzers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6617","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6617","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6618","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose the rendering framework for painting-like image generation and general system architecture for mobile device. Especially, we focused on a color division method for generating neo-impressionist images. The French painter, George Seurat, introduced pointillism under the theory that the individual pigments of colors on the canvas are reconstructed on the human retina. Pointillism is a painting technique in which many small brush strokes are combined to form a picture and determines the color of brush strokes based on the optical mixing of juxtaposed colors. In order to express countless separate dots, we form hierarchical points using Wang Tiles contained points. Also palette will be constructed using neo-impressionist colors. Based on this palette, we propose color division algorithm that distributes hierarchical point's color to pointillist colors using probability function. Finally, hierarchical points set that applied proposed color division rule is converted into brush strokes that possesses properties such as shape and direction. This rendering algorithm is performed in our proposed system. Our scheme is able to produce a painting with artistic style and be applied to the various platform having the different computing performance and display resolution. This system also can be extended to various imaging devices (IPTV, camera, smart phone, digital photo frame and so on)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6619","fieldValue":" Since the typical erase cycle limit of a NAND flash memory's block is about 1,000,000, flash memory should be erased as evenly as possible; otherwise, file system hot spots will soon be worn out. This forces a NAND flash memory file system to scan the whole flash memory during its mount rather than saving frequently updated file system information in a fixed area. Since the mount time linearly increases with the size of NAND flash memory, boot times of embedded systems are also linearly increased. In addition, since data loss may occur if a file system terminates abnormally due to unexpected errors, a stability scheme for NAND flash memory file system is in great demand. To resolve these problems, this article suggests an extended logical block called Exblock (Extended Block) and a table called SNode (Snapshot Node) to reduce the mount time and proposes a new journaling scheme to improve stability for an enhanced file system for NAND flash memory storage called ENFFiS (Enhanced NAND Flash memory File System). It also proposes a new cache policy to improve read\/write performances. ENFFiS shows better performance than existing file systems in terms of reading, writing, mount time and stability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6619","fieldValue":"ACM"}
