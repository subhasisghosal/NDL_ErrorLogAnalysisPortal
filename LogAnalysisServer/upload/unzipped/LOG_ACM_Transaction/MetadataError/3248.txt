The authors use an orthographic density metric to motivate the need for a finer-grained ranking method for candidate words than unweighted Levenshtein edit distance. The Did You Mean...? architecture is described, and the authors show that mean reciprocal rank can be improved by tuning operation weights according to sound confusions, and by anticipating likely spelling variants."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2978","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2978","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.format.extent","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20678","fieldValue":"{\"startingPage\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20678","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20678","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20679","fieldValue":" This article advocates the revival of coroutines as a convenient general control abstraction. After proposing a new classification of coroutines, we introduce the concept of full asymmetric coroutines and provide a precise definition for it through an operational semantics. We then demonstrate that full coroutines have an expressive power equivalent to one-shot continuations and one-shot delimited continuations. We also show that full asymmetric coroutines and one-shot delimited continuations have many similarities, and therefore present comparable benefits. Nevertheless, coroutines are easier implemented and understood, especially in the realm of procedural languages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20679","fieldValue":"ACM"}
