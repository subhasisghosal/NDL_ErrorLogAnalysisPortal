{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2271","fieldValue":" The stable marriage problem has recently been studied in its general setting, where both ties and incomplete lists are allowed. It is NP-hard to find a stable matching of maximum size, while any stable matching is a maximal matching and thus trivially we can obtain a 2-approximation algorithm. In this article, we give the first nontrivial result for approximation of factor less than two. Our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of 2\/(1 &plus; $L^âˆ\u20192$) for instances in which only men have ties of length at most L. When both men and women are allowed to have ties but the lengths are limited to two, then we show a ratio of 13\/7(1.1052)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13334","fieldValue":"Liu, Sean Shih-Ying"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13334","fieldValue":"Lo, Wan-Ting"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13334","fieldValue":"Lee, Chieh-Jui"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13334","fieldValue":"Chen, Hung-Ming"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13334","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a flip-flop merging algorithm based on agglomerative clustering. Compared to previous state-of-the-art on flip-flop merging, our proposed algorithm outperforms that of Chang et al. [2010] and Wang et al. [2011] in all aspects, including number of flip-flop reductions, increase in signal wirelength, displacement of flip-flops, and execution time. Our proposed algorithm also has minimal disruption to original placement. In comparison with Jiang et al. [2011], Wang et al. [2011], and Chang et al. [2010], our proposed algorithm has the least displacement when relocating merged flip-flops. While previous works on flip-flop merging focus on the number of flip-flop reduction, we further evaluate the power consumption of clock tree after flip-flop merging. To further minimize clock tree wirelength, we propose a framework that determines a preferable location for relocated merged flip-flops for clock tree synthesis (CTS). Experimental results show that our CTS-driven flip-flop merging can reduce clock tree wirelength by an average of 7.82&percnt; with minimum clock network power consumption compared to all of the previous works."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13334","fieldValue":"Agglomerative-based flip-flop merging and relocation for signal wirelength and clock tree optimization"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13334","fieldValue":"ACM"}
