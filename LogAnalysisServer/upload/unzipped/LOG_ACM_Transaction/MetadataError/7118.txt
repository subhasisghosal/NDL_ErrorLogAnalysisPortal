ZRP proactively maintains routing information for a local neighborhood (routing zone), while reactively acquiring routes to destinations beyond the routing zone. This hybrid routing approach can be more efficient than traditional routing schemes. However, without proper query control techniques, the ZRP cannot provide the expected reduction in the control traffic.Our proposed query control schemes exploit the structure of the routing zone to provide enhanced detection and prevention of overlapping queries. These techniques can be applied to single- or multiple-channel ad hoc networks to improve both the delay and control traffic performance of ZRP. Our query control mechanisms allow ZRP to provide routes to all accessible network nodes, with less control traffic than purely proactive link state or purely reactive route discovery, and with less delay than conventional flood searching."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9063","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/9063","fieldValue":"<i>Ad hoc<\/i> network"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9063","fieldValue":"ZRP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9063","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9063","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9064","fieldValue":" Polling schemes are an important class of medium access control (MAC) protocols for wireless local area networks (WLANs). A major drawback of these schemes is their inefficiency when only a small number of mobile stations have packets to transmit. This inefficiency is due to the polling of mobile stations with no packets to transmit, which delays the transmissions of mobile stations with packets. In this paper, we suggest a new polling MAC which exploits the capture phenomena and enables simultaneous polling and transmissions of information packets. Mathematical analysis and simulation results show that the new MAC overcomes the above inefficiency considerably, and thus it is more efficient in the sense that it enables higher throughput and a lower access delay. For example, we show scenarios in which the average access delay is reduced by about 30% and the throughput increases by 66%-75%."}
