Generating such wrinkles in a virtual environment currently requires either a time-consuming manual design process, or a computationally expensive simulation, often combined with accurate parameter-tuning requiring specialized animator skills. Our work presents an alternative approach for wrinkle generation which combines coarse cloth animation with a post-processing step for efficient generation of realistic-looking fine dynamic wrinkles. Our method uses the stretch tensor of the coarse animation output as a guide for wrinkle placement. To ensure temporal coherence, the placement mechanism uses a space-time approach allowing not only for smooth wrinkle appearance and disappearance, but also for wrinkle motion, splitting, and merging over time. Our method generates believable wrinkle geometry using specialized curve-based implicit deformers. The method is fully automatic and has a single user control parameter that enables the user to mimic different fabrics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16370","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16370","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16371","fieldValue":" Destination maps are navigational aids designed to show anyone within a region how to reach a location (the destination). Hand-designed destination maps include only the most important roads in the region and are non-uniformly scaled to ensure that all of the important roads from the highways to the residential streets are visible. We present the first automated system for creating such destination maps based on the design principles used by mapmakers. Our system includes novel algorithms for selecting the important roads based on mental representations of road networks, and for laying out the roads based on a non-linear optimization procedure. The final layouts are labeled and rendered in a variety of styles ranging from informal to more formal map styles. The system has been used to generate over 57,000 destination maps by thousands of users. We report feedback from both a formal and informal user study, as well as provide quantitative measures of success."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16371","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16371","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16372","fieldValue":"Wang, Yu-Shuen"}
