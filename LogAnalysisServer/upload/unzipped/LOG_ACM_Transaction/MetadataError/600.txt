Although the original method is really innovative, there still remains room for improvement for our purpose. This article proposes a compact algorithm for placement based on corner block list. By introducing the dummy blocks in CBL, our algorithm can intellectively employ dummy blocks in the packing to represent the placement including empty rooms, which corner block list cannot represent. Our algorithm can obtain the fast convergence to an optimal solution. Based on the compact approach, we propose a new way to handle arbitrary shaped rectilinear modules. The experimental results are demonstrated by some benchmark data and the performance shows effectiveness of the proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12902","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12902","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12903","fieldValue":" We develop a new technique called buffer merging for reducing memory requirements of synchronous dataflow (SDF) specifications. SDF has proven to be an attractive model for specifying DSP systems, and is used in many commercial tools like System Canvas, SPW, and Cocentric. Good synthesis from an SDF specification depends crucially on scheduling, and memory is an important metric for generating efficient schedules. Previous techniques on memory minimization have either not considered buffer sharing at all, or have done so at a fairly coarse level (the meaning of this will be made more precise in the article). In this article, we develop a buffer overlaying strategy that works at the level of an input\/output edge pair of an actor. It works by algebraically encapsulating the lifetimes of the tokens on the input\/output edge pair, and determines the maximum amount of the input buffer space that can be reused by the output. We develop the mathematical basis for performing merging operations, and develop several algorithms and heuristics for using the merging technique for generating efficient implementations. We show improvements of up to 48&percnt; over previous techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12903","fieldValue":"Buffer mergingâ\u20AC\u201Da powerful technique for reducing memory requirements of synchronous dataflow specifications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12903","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12903","fieldValue":"ACM"}
