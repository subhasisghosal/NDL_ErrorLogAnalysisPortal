Imitation-based learning involves learning from an expert by observing the demonstration of a task and then replicating it. This mechanism makes it convenient for a knowledge engineer to transfer knowledge to a software agent. This article applies imitation to learn not only the strategy of an individual agent, but also the collaborative strategy of a team of agents to achieve a common goal. The article presents an imitation-based solution that learns a weighted na√Øve Bayes structure, whereas the weights of the model are optimized using Artificial Immune Systems. The learned model is then used by agents to act autonomously. The applicability of the presented approach is assessed in the RoboCup Soccer 3D Simulation environment, which is a promising platform to address many complex real-world problems. The performance of the trained agents is benchmarked against other RoboCup Soccer 3D Simulation teams. In addition to performance characteristics, the research also analyzes the behavioral traits of the imitating team to assess how closely they are imitating the demonstrating team."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/1343","fieldValue":"Weighted na&iuml;ve Bayes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4457","fieldValue":" One of the challenges faced by all molecular docking algorithms is that of being able to discriminate between correct results and false positives obtained in the simulations. The scoring or energetic function is the one that must fulfill this task. Several scoring functions have been developed and new methodologies are still under development. In this paper, we have employed the Compactly Supported Radial Basis Functions (CSRBF) to create analytical representations of molecular surfaces, which are then included as key components of a new scoring function for molecular docking. The method proposed here achieves a better ranking of the solutions produced by the program DOCK, as compared with the ranking done by its native contact scoring function. Our new analytical scoring function based on CSRBF can be easily included in different available docking programs as a reliable and quick filter in large-scale docking simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4457","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4457","fieldValue":"Evaluation of Geometric Complementarity between Molecular Surfaces Using Compactly Supported Radial Basis Functions"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4457","fieldValue":"ACM"}
