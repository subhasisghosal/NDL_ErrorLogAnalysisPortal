However, the reserved network resource is susceptible to resource theft and abuse. Without a resource access control mechanism that can efficiently differentiate legitimate real-time traffic from attacking packets, the traffic conditioning and policing enforced at Internet Service Provider (ISP) edge routers cannot protect the reserved network resource from embezzlement. On the contrary to the usual expectation, the traffic policing at edge routers aggravates their vulnerability to flooding attacks by blindly dropping packets. In this paper, we propose a fast and lightweight IP network-edge resource access control mechanism, called IP Easy-pass, to prevent unauthorized access to reserved network resources at edge devices. We attach a unique pass to each legitimate real-time packet so that an ISP edge router can validate the legitimacy of the incoming IP packet very quickly and simply by checking its pass. We present the generation of Easy-pass, its embedding, and verification procedures. We implement the IP Easy-pass mechanism in the Linux kernel, and measure its overhead on our testbed. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness against packet forgery and resource embezzlement attempts by conducting a series of experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9403","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9403","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9403","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1848","fieldValue":" Coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture typically has an array of processing elements which are controlled by a centralized unit. This makes it difficult to execute programs having control divergence among PEs without predication. However, conventional predication techniques have a negative impact on both performance and power consumption due to longer instruction words and unnecessary instruction-fetching decoding nullifying steps. This article reveals performance and power issues in predicated execution which have not been well-addressed yet. Furthermore, it proposes fast and power-efficient predication mechanisms. Experiments conducted through gate-level simulation show that our mechanism improves energy-delay product by 11.9&percnt; to 23.8&percnt; on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1848","fieldValue":"CGRA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1848","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1848","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9404","fieldValue":" In this paper, we develop, analyze and implement a congestion control scheme in a noncooperative game framework, where each user's cost function is composed of a pricing function proportional to the queueing delay experienced by the user, and a fairly general utility function which captures the user demand for bandwidth. Using a network model based on fluid approximations and through a realistic modeling of queues, we establish the existence of a unique equilibrium as well as its global asymptotic stability for a general network topology, where boundary effects are also taken into account. We also provide sufficient conditions for system stability when there is a bottleneck link shared by multiple users experiencing nonnegligible communication delays. In addition, we study an adaptive pricing scheme using hybrid systems concepts. Based on these theoretical foundations, we implement a window-based, end-to-end congestion control scheme, and simulate it in ns-2 network simulator on various network topologies with sizable propagation delays."}
