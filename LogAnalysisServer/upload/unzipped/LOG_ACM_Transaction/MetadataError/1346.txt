We discuss a new texture representation called the BTF (bidirectional texture function) which captures the variation in texture with illumination and viewing direction. We present a BTF database with image textures from over 60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of viewing and illumination directions. We describe the methods involved in collecting the database as well as the importqance and uniqueness of this database for computer graphics. A related quantity to the BTF is the familiar BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function). The measurement methods involved in the BTF database are conducive to simultaneous measurement of the BRDF. Accordingly, we also present a BRDF database with reflectance measurements for over 60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of viewing and illumination directions. Both of these unique databases are publicly available and have important implications for computer graphics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15168","fieldValue":"Joan-Arinyo, R."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15168","fieldValue":"Soto-Riera, A."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15168","fieldValue":" In the past few years, there has been a strong trend towards developing parametric, computer-aided design systems based on geometric constraint solving. An effective way to capture the design intent in these systems is to define relationships between geometric and technological variables. In general, geometric constraint solving including functional relationships requires a general approach and appropriate techniques to achieve the expected functional capabilities. This work reports on a hybrid method that combines two geometric constraint solving techniques: constructive and equational. The hybrid solver has the capability of managing functional relationships between dimension variables and variables representing conditions external to the geometric problem. The hybrid solver is described as a rewriting system and is shown to be correct."}
