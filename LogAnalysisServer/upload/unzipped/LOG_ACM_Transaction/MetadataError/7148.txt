The explosion in Internet use has created a huge demand for telecommunications capacity. However, this demand is extremely volatile, making network planning difficult. In this paper, modern financial option pricing methods are applied to the problem of network investment decision timing. In particular, we study the optimal decision problem of building new network capacity in the presence of stochastic demand for services. Adding new capacity requires a capital investment, which must be balanced by uncertain future revenues. We study the underlying risk factor in the bandwidth market and then apply real options theory to the upgrade decision problem. We notice that sometimes it is optimal to wait until the maximum capacity of a line is nearly reached before upgrading directly to the line with the highest known transmission rate (skipping the intermediate lines). It appears that past upgrade practice underestimates the conflicting effects of growth and volatility. This explains the current overcapacity in available bandwidth. To the best of our knowledge, this real options approach has not been used previously in the area of network capacity planning. Consequently, we believe that this methodology can offer insights for network management."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9116","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9116","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9116","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8346","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9117","fieldValue":" This paper presents a detailed analysis of traces of domain name system (DNS) and associated TCP traffic collected on the Internet links of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). The first part of the analysis details how clients at these institutions interact with the wide-area domain name system, focusing on client-perceived performance and the prevalence of failures and errors. The second part evaluates the effectiveness of DNS caching.In the most recent MIT trace, 23% of lookups receive no answer; these lookups account for more than half of all traced DNS packets since query packets are retransmitted overly persistently. About 13% of all lookups result in an answer that indicates an error condition. Many of these errors appear to be caused by missing inverse (IP-to-name) mappings or NS records that point to nonexistent or inappropriate hosts. 27% of the queries sent to the root name servers result in such errors.The paper also presents the results of trace-driven simulations that explore the effect of varying TTLs and varying degrees of cache sharing on DNS cache hit rates. Due to the heavy-tailed nature of name accesses, reducing the TTLs of address (A) records to as low as a few hundred seconds has little adverse effect on hit rates, and little benefit is obtained from sharing a forwarding DNS cache among more than 10 or 20 clients. These results suggest that client latency is not as dependent on aggressive caching as is commonly believed, and that the widespread use of dynamic low-TTL A-record bindings should not greatly increase DNS related wide-area network traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9117","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9117","fieldValue":"DNS"}
