{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18563","fieldValue":" A technique is presented for the graphical representation of some contour (level) surfaces of a function of three variables defined by its values on an array of points (xi, yj, zk). The algorithm involves drawing and projecting the contour curves corresponding to the cross sections x = xI and y = yj. Because the curves are drawn as thick, opaque bands, which mask all bands in the immediate background, a sense of depth is retained, yet background contours are still visible between the bands."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18563","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18563","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18564","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18564","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18565","fieldValue":" The methodology for the simultaneous solution of ordinary differential equations and the associated first-order parametric sensitivity equations is presented, and a detailed description of its implementation as a modification of a widely disseminated implicit ODE solver is given. The error control strategy ensures that local error criteria are independently satisfied by both the model and sensitivity solutions. The internal logic effectuated by this implementation is detailed. Numerical testing of the algorithm is reported; results indicate that greater reliability and improved efficiency is offered over other sensitivity analysis methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18565","fieldValue":"The simultaneous solution and sensitivity analysis of systems described by ordinary differential equations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18566","fieldValue":" ODESSA is a package of FORTRAN routines for simultaneous solution of ordinary differential equations and the associated first-order parametric sensitivity equations, yielding the ODE solution vector y&barbelow;(t) and the first-order sensitivity coefficients with respect to equation parameters p&barbelow;, &sgr;y&barbelow;(t)\/&sgr;p&barbelow;.
