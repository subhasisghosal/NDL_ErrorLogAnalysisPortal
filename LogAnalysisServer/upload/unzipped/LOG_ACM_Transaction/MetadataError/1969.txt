Directly applying existing monocular image warping techniques to stereoscopic images is problematic as it often introduces vertical disparities and damages the original disparity distribution. In this paper, we show that these problems can be solved by appropriately warping both the disparity map and the two images of a stereoscopic image. We accordingly develop a technique for extending existing image warping algorithms to stereoscopic images. This technique divides stereoscopic image warping into three steps. Our method first applies the user-specified warping to one of the two images. Our method then computes the target disparity map according to the user specified warping. The target disparity map is optimized to preserve the perceived 3D shape of image content after image warping. Our method finally warps the other image using a spatially-varying warping method guided by the target disparity map. Our experiments show that our technique enables existing warping methods to be effectively applied to stereoscopic images, ranging from parametric global warping to non-parametric spatially-varying warping."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16773","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16773","fieldValue":" Binocular disparity is one of the most important depth cues used by the human visual system. Recently developed stereo-perception models allow us to successfully manipulate disparity in order to improve viewing comfort, depth discrimination as well as stereo content compression and display. Nonetheless, all existing models neglect the substantial influence of luminance on stereo perception. Our work is the first to account for the interplay of luminance contrast (magnitude\/frequency) and disparity and our model predicts the human response to complex stereo-luminance images. Besides improving existing disparity-model applications (e.g., difference metrics or compression), our approach offers new possibilities, such as joint luminance contrast and disparity manipulation or the optimization of auto-stereoscopic content. We validate our results in a user study, which also reveals the advantage of considering luminance contrast and its significant impact on disparity manipulation techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16773","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16773","fieldValue":"ACM"}
