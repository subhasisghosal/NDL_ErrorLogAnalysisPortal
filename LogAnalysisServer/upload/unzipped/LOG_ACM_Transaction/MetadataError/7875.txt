Their performance optimization is indeed a challenging issue. Even though affine loop nests are generally present, the short trip counts and the complexity of mathematical expressions, which vary among different problems, make it hard to determine an optimal sequence of successful transformations. Our investigation has resulted in the implementation of a compiler (called COFFEE) for local assembly kernels, fully integrated with a framework for developing finite element methods. The compiler manipulates abstract syntax trees generated from a domain-specific language by introducing domain-aware optimizations for instruction-level parallelism and register locality. Eventually, it produces C code including vector SIMD intrinsics. Experiments using a range of real-world finite element problems of increasing complexity show that significant performance improvement is achieved. The generality of the approach and the applicability of the proposed code transformations to other domains is also discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1963","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1963","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10564","fieldValue":"Al-Rodhaan, Mznah A."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10564","fieldValue":"Al-Dhelaan, Abdullah"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10564","fieldValue":" In this paper, we investigate the problem of achieving proportional fairness via access point (AP) association in multirate WLANs. This problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming with an objective function of maximizing the total user bandwidth utilities in the whole network. Such a formulation jointly considers fairness and AP selection. We first propose a centralized algorithm Non-Linear Approximation Optimization for Proportional Fairness (NLAO-PF) to derive the userâ\u20AC\u201CAP association via relaxation. Since the relaxation may cause a large integrality gap, a compensation function is introduced to ensure that our algorithm can achieve at least half of the optimal in the worst case. This algorithm is assumed to be adopted periodically for resource management. To handle the case of dynamic user membership, we propose a distributed heuristic Best Performance First (BPF) based on a novel performance revenue function, which provides an AP selection criterion for newcomers. When an existing user leaves the network, the transmission times of other users associated with the same AP can be redistributed easily based on NLAO-PF. Extensive simulation study has been performed to validate our design and to compare the performance of our algorithms to those of the state of the art."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10564","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
