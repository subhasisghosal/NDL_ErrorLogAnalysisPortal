Identification of (pre-) miRNAs helps in understanding regulatory processes. Machine learning methods have been designed for pre-miRNA identification. However, most of them cannot provide reliable predictive performances on independent testing data sets. We assumed this is because the training sets, especially the negative training sets, are not sufficiently representative. To generate a representative negative set, we proposed a novel negative sample selection technique, and successfully collected negative samples with improved quality. Two recent classifiers rebuilt with the proposed negative set achieved an improvement of âˆ¼6 percent in their predictive performance, which confirmed this assumption. Based on the proposed negative set, we constructed a training set, and developed an online system called miRNApre specifically for human pre-miRNA identification. We showed that miRNApre achieved accuracies on updated human and nonhuman data sets that were 34.3 and 7.6 percent higher than those achieved by current methods. The results suggest that miRNApre is an effective tool for pre-miRNA identification. Additionally, by integrating miRNApre, we developed a miRNA mining tool, mirnaDetect, which can be applied to find potential miRNAs in genome-scale data. MirnaDetect achieved a comparable mining performance on human chromosome 19 data as other existing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5032","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5032","fieldValue":"Improved and promising identification of human MicroRNAs by incorporating a high-quality negative set"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5033","fieldValue":" Small samples are commonplace in genomic\/proteomic classification, the result being inadequate classifier design and poor error estimation. The problem has recently been addressed by utilizing prior knowledge in the form of a prior distribution on an uncertainty class of feature-label distributions. A critical issue remains: how to incorporate biological knowledge into the prior distribution. For genomics\/proteomics, the most common kind of knowledge is in the form of signaling pathways. Thus, it behooves us to find methods of transforming pathway knowledge into knowledge of the feature-label distribution governing the classification problem. In this paper, we address the problem of prior probability construction by proposing a series of optimization paradigms that utilize the incomplete prior information contained in pathways (both topological and regulatory). The optimization paradigms employ the marginal log-likelihood, established using a small number of feature-label realizations (sample points) regularized with the prior pathway information about the variables. In the special case of a Normal-Wishart prior distribution on the mean and inverse covariance matrix (precision matrix) of a Gaussian distribution, these optimization problems become convex.
