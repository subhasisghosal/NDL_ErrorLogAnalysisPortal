In this article, we propose a novel method for detecting various video copies in a video sequence. To achieve fast and robust detection, the method fully integrates several components, namely the min-hashing signature to compactly represent a video sequence, a spatio-temporal matching scheme to accurately evaluate video similarity compiled from the spatial and temporal aspects, and some speedup techniques to expedite both min-hashing indexing and spatio-temporal matching. The results of experiments demonstrate that, compared to several baseline methods with different feature descriptors and matching schemes, the proposed method which combines both global and local feature descriptors yields the best performance when encountering a variety of video transformations. The method is very fast, requiring approximately 0.06 seconds to search for copies of a thirty-second video clip in a six-hour video sequence."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25364","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25364","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25365","fieldValue":"Al-HADRUSI, Musab"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25365","fieldValue":" Providing video streaming users with expected waiting times enhances their perceived quality-of-service (QoS) and encourages them to wait. In the absence of any waiting-time feedback, users are more likely to defect because of the uncertainty as to when their services will start. We analyze waiting-time predictability in scalable video streaming. We propose two prediction schemes and study their effectiveness when applied with various stream merging techniques and scheduling policies. The results demonstrate that the waiting time can be predicted accurately, especially when enhanced cost-based scheduling is applied. The combination of waiting-time prediction and cost-based scheduling leads to outstanding performance benefits."}
