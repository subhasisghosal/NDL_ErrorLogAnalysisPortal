As illustrations, this approach is used to develop interpolants for three explicit RK formulas, including those employed in the well-known subroutines RKF45 and DVERK. A typical result is that no extra function evaluations are required to obtain an interpolant with O(h5) local truncation error for the fifth-order RK formula used in RKF45; two extra function evaluations per step are required to obtain an interpolant with O(h6) local truncation error for this RK formula."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18523","fieldValue":" The problem of finding the plane curve of minimal elastic energy with prescribed endpoints and end-directions was solved in 1983 by B.
