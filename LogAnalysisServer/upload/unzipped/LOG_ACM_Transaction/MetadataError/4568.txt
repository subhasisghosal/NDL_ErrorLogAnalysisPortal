In this article, we propose reverse computation as an alternative approach, and compare its execution performance against that of state-saving. Using compiler techniques, we describe an approach to automatically generate reversible computations, and to optimize them to reap the performance benefits of reverse computation transparently. For certain fine-grain models, such as queuing network models, we show that reverse computation can yield significant improvement in execution speed coupled with significant reduction in memory utilization, as compared to traditional state-saving. On sample models using reverse computation, we observe as much as a six-fold improvement in execution speed over traditional state-saving."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24810","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24810","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24811","fieldValue":" Although redundancy in model specification generally has negative connotations, we offer arguments for revising those convictions. Defining â\u20ACœrepresentational redundancyâ\u20AC? as the inclusion of any symbols not required to fulfill the study objectives, we cite several sources of redundancy, classified as accidental or intentional, that contribute positively to the model development tasks. Comparative benefits and detriments are discussed briefly. Focusing on the most interesting source of redundancy&dash;that which is intentionally induced by a modeling methodologyâ\u20AC\u201Dwe demonstrate that automated elimination of redundancy can actually improve model execution time. Using four models drawn from the literature that are easily understood, but which represent some differences in size and complexity, the direct graphical representations shows improvements over a base case ranging from 27.3 percent to 68.1 percent in execution time. Further, increasing improvement is realized with increasing model size and complexity. These results are encouraging because they suggest that modeling methodologies with automated model diagnosis can significantly reduce both execution and developments time and cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24811","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24811","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24812","fieldValue":" We consider the impact of discarding and tempering on modern huge period high speed linear generators, and illustrate how a simple strategy yields unexpected &mdashh; and unwanted â\u20AC\u201D success in a fair coin gambling which is simulated by a recently proposed generator.
