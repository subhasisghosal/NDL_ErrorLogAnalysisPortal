This problem is driven by the requirements from emerging location-aware applications, which allow a user to pose queries and obtain information in reference to places, for example, â\u20ACœhomeâ\u20AC?, â\u20ACœworkâ\u20AC? or â\u20ACœNorthwest Health Clubâ\u20AC?. It is a challenge to map from physical locations to personally meaningful places due to a lack of understanding of what constitutes the real users' personally meaningful places. Previous work has explored algorithms to discover personal places from location data. However, we know of no systematic empirical evaluations of these algorithms, leaving designers of location-aware applications in the dark about their choices. Our work remedies this situation. We extended a clustering algorithm to discover places. We also defined a set of essential evaluation metrics and an interactive evaluation framework. We then conducted a large-scale experiment that collected real users' location data and personally meaningful places, and illustrated the utility of our evaluation framework. Our results establish a baseline that future work can measure itself against. They also demonstrate that that our algorithm discovers places with reasonable accuracy and outperforms the well-known K-Means clustering algorithm for place discovery. Finally, we provide evidence that shapes more complex than â\u20ACœpointsâ\u20AC? are required to represent the full range of people's everyday places."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23939","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23939","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23940","fieldValue":" The setting of the term frequency normalization hyper-parameter suffers from the query dependence and collection dependence problems, which remarkably hurt the robustness of the retrieval performance. Our study in this article investigates three term frequency normalization methods, namely normalization 2, BM25's normalization and the Dirichlet Priors normalization. We tackle the query dependence problem by modifying the query term weight using a Divergence From Randomness term weighting model, and tackle the collection dependence problem by measuring the correlation of the normalized term frequency with the document length. Our research hypotheses for the two problems, as well as an automatic hyper-parameter setting methodology, are extensively validated and evaluated on four Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) collections."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23940","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23940","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23941","fieldValue":" Documents with timestamps, such as email and news, can be placed along a timeline. The timeline for a set of documents returned in response to a query gives an indication of how documents relevant to that query are distributed in time. Examining the timeline of a query result set allows us to characterize both how temporally dependent the topic is, as well as how relevant the results are likely to be. We outline characteristic patterns in query result set timelines, and show experimentally that we can automatically classify documents into these classes. We also show that properties of the query result set timeline can help predict the mean average precision of a query. These results show that meta-features associated with a query can be combined with text retrieval techniques to improve our understanding and treatment of text search on documents with timestamps."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23941","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23941","fieldValue":"ACM"}
