Using a $K_eff model as the figure of merit for inductive coupling, we then formulate two simultaneous shield insertion and net ordering (SINO) problems: the optimal SINO\/NF problem to find a minimal area SINO solution that is free of capacitive and inductive noise, and the optimal SINO\/NB problem to find a minimal area SINO solution that is free of capacitive noise and is under the given inductive noise bound. We reveal that both optimal SINO problems are NP-hard, and propose effective approximate algorithms for the two problems. Experiments show that our SINO\/NB algorithm uses from 51&percnt; to 82&percnt; fewer shields compared to uniform shield insertion and net ordering (US + NO), and uses from 4&percnt; to 47&percnt; fewer shields compared to separated net ordering and shield insertion (NO + SI). Furthermore, the SINO\/NB solutions under practical noise bounds use from 38&percnt; to 61&percnt; fewer shields compared to SINO\/NF solutions, and use up to 36&percnt; fewer shields compared to the theoretical lower bound for optimal SINO\/NF solutions. Moreover, we show that the Keff$ model has a high fidelity versus the noise voltage computed using accurate RLC circuit models and SPICE simulations. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that presents an in-depth study on the automatic layout optimization of multiple nets to minimize both capacitive and inductive noise."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12885","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12885","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12886","fieldValue":"Vicente, Juan D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12886","fieldValue":" Placement is key issue of integrated circuit physical design. There exist some techniques inspired in thermodynamics coping with this problem as Simulated Annealing. In this article, we present a combinatorial optimization method directly derived from both Thermodynamics and Information Theory. In TCO (Thermodynamic Combinatorial Optimization), two kinds of processes are considered: microstate and macrostate transformations. Applying the Shannon's definition of entropy to reversible microstate transformations, a probability of acceptance based on Fermi--Dirac statistics is derived. On the other hand, applying thermodynamic laws to macrostate transformations, an efficient annealing schedule is provided. TCO has been compared with a custom Simulated Annealing (SA) tool on a set of benchmark circuits for the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) placement problem. TCO has provided the high-quality results of SA, while inheriting the adaptive properties of Natural Optimization (NO)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12886","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12886","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12887","fieldValue":" Architectures that implement the Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) standard have to meet the enormous computing demands of cryptographic algorithms. In addition, IPSec architectures have to be flexible enough to adapt to diverse security parameters. This article proposes an FPGA-based Adaptive Cryptographic Engine (ACE) for IPSec architectures. By taking advantage of FPGA technology, ACE can adapt to diverse security parameters on the fly while providing superior performance compared with software-based solutions. In this paper, we focus on performance issues. A diverse set of private-key cryptographic algorithms is utilized to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed cryptographic engine. The time performance metrics are throughput and key-setup latency. The latency metric is the most important measure for IPSec where a small amount of data is processed per key and key context switching occurs repeatedly. We are not aware of any published results that include extensive key-setup latency results."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12887","fieldValue":"AES"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12887","fieldValue":"ACM"}
