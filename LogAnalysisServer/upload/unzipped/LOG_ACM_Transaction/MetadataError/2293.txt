The key idea is to give the illusion of shape sharpening or rounding by exaggerating orientation patterns in the image that are strongly correlated to surface curvature. We build on a growing literature in both human and computer vision showing the importance of orientation patterns in the communication of shape, which we complement with mathematical relationships and a statistical image analysis revealing that structure tensors are indeed strongly correlated to surface shape features. We then rely on these correlations to introduce a flow-guided image warping algorithm, which in effect exaggerates orientation patterns involved in shape perception. We evaluate our technique by 1) comparing it to ground truth shape deformations, and 2) performing two perceptual experiments to assess its effects. Our algorithm produces convincing shape manipulation results on synthetic images and photographs, for various materials and lighting environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17581","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Univ.

Some of those may transfigure appearance and inspire creative changes, some not, but how would we know without physically trying? We present a system that enables automatic synthesis of limitless numbers of appearances. A user inputs one or more photos (as many as they like) of his or her face, text queries an appearance of interest (just like they'd search an image search engine) and gets as output the input person in the queried appearance. Rather than fixing the number of queries or a dataset our system utilizes all the relevant and searchable images on the Internet, estimates a doppelgÃ¤nger set for the inputs, and utilizes it to generate composites. We present a large number of examples on photos taken with completely unconstrained imaging conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17582","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17582","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2663","fieldValue":" We present a (1 + &epsiv;)-approximation algorithm running in O(f(&epsiv;) Â· $nlogâ\u20AC\u2030^4$n) time for finding the diameter of an undirected planar graph with n vertices and with nonnegative edge lengths."}
