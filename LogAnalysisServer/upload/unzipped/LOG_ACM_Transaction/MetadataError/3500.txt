In particular, we consider source localization using acoustic sensors dispersed over a large area, with the individual sensors located too far apart for direct connectivity. An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is employed for collecting sensor data, with the UAV route adaptively adjusted based on data from sensors already visited, in order to minimize the time to localize events of interest. The UAV therefore acts as a information-seeking data mule, not only providing connectivity, but also making Bayesian inferences from the data gathered in order to guide its future actions. The system we demonstrate has a modular architecture, comprising efficient algorithms for acoustic signal processing, routing the UAV to the sensors, and source localization. We report on extensive field tests which not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our general approach, but also yield specific practical insights into GPS time synchronization and localization accuracy, acoustic signal and channel characteristics, and the effects of environmental phenomena."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21426","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2480730.2480733\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21426","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21426","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21427","fieldValue":"Lu, Yung-Hsiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21427","fieldValue":" Energy conservation is essential in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) because of limited energy in nodes' batteries. Collaborative beamforming uses multiple transmitters to form antenna arrays; the electromagnetic waves from these antenna arrays can create constructive interferences at the receiver and increase the transmission distance. Each transmitter can use lower power and save energy, since the energy consumption is spread over multiple transmitters. Each beamforming transmission requires multiple collaborative transmitters. Repetitively using the same transmitters will deplete their energy and create coverage holes in the sensing area. To prevent holes, energy should be balanced by using different transmitters. This article investigates the factors that can affect the energy consumption and network lifetime when using beamforming. We present an algorithm for selecting the transmitters in order to prolong the network lifetime. Compared with an existing beamforming transmitters scheduling algorithm, our algorithm doubles the network lifetime. When compared with direct transmission or multihop transmissions towards a receiver far away from the sensing area, our approach can increase the network's lifetime substantially."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21427","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2480730.2480734\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21427","fieldValue":"ACM"}
