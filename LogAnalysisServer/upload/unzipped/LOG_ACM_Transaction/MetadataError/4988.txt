Without proper background, it is also difficult to understand retrieved spoken paragraphs. This paper therefore presents a new approach of spoken knowledge organization for course lectures for efficient personalized learning. Automatically extracted key terms are taken as the fundamental elements of the semantics of the course. Key term graph constructed by connecting related key terms forms the backbone of the global semantic structure. Audio\/video signals are divided into multi-layer temporal structure including paragraphs, sections and chapters, each of which includes a summary as the local semantic structure. The interconnection between semantic structure and temporal structure together with spoken term detection jointly offer to the learners efficient ways to navigate across the course knowledge with personalized learning paths considering their personal interests, available time and background knowledge. A preliminary prototype system has also been successfully developed."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3648","fieldValue":"Spoken knowledge organization by semantic structuring and a prototype course lecture system for personalized learning"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3648","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3648","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3649","fieldValue":" This paper presents a speech enhancement technique for signals corrupted by nonstationary acoustic noises. The proposed approach applies the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to the noisy speech signal and obtains a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The main contribution of the proposed procedure is the adoption of the Hurst exponent in the selection of IMFs to reconstruct the speech. This EMD and Hurst-based (EMDH) approach is evaluated in speech enhancement experiments considering environmental acoustic noises with different indices of nonstationarity. The results show that the EMDH improves the segmental signal-to-noise ratio and an overall quality composite measure, encompassing the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). Moreover, the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) measure reinforces the superior performance of EMDH. Finally, the EMDH is also examined in a speaker identification task in noisy conditions. The proposed technique leads to the highest speaker identification rates when compared to the baseline speech enhancement algorithms and also to a multicondition training procedure."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3649","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3649","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3650","fieldValue":"Jensen, Tobias Lindstrm T L"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3650","fieldValue":" In linear prediction of speech, the 1-norm error minimization criterion has been shown to provide a valid alternative to the 2-norm minimization criterion. However, unlike 2-norm minimization, 1-norm minimization does not guarantee the stability of the corresponding all-pole filter and can generate saturations when this is used to synthesize speech. In this paper, we introduce two new methods to obtain intrinsically stable predictors with the 1-norm minimization. The first method is based on constraining the roots of the predictor to lie within the unit circle by reducing the numerical range of the shift operator associated with the particular prediction problem considered. The second method uses the alternative Cauchy bound to impose a convex constraint on the predictor in the 1-norm error minimization. These methods are compared with two existing methods: the Burg method, based on the 1-norm minimization of the forward and backward prediction error, and the iteratively reweighted 2-norm minimization known to converge to the 1-norm minimization with an appropriate selection of weights. The evaluation gives proof of the effectiveness of the new methods, performing as well as unconstrained 1-norm based linear prediction for modeling and coding of speech."}
