The main result of the paper is the design and analysis of Algorithm Z; it does the sampling in one pass using constant space and in O(n(1 + log(N\/n))) expected time, which is optimum, up to a constant factor. Several optimizations are studied that collectively improve the speed of the naive version of the algorithm by an order of magnitude. We give an efficient Pascal-like implementation that incorporates these modifications and that is suitable for general use. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that Algorithm Z outperforms current methods by a significant margin."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18486","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18486","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2735","fieldValue":" This article explores the asymptotic complexity of two problems related to the Miller-Rabin-Selfridge primality test. The first problem is to tabulate strong pseudoprimes to a single fixed base a. It is now proven that tabulating up to x requires O(x) arithmetic operations and O(xlogâ\u20AC\u2030x) bits of space. The second problem is to find all strong liars and witnesses, given a fixed odd composite n. This appears to be unstudied, and a randomized algorithm is presented that requires an expected $O((logâ\u20AC\u2030n)^2$ + &verbar;S(n)&verbar;) operations (here S(n) is the set of strong liars). Although interesting in their own right, a notable application is the search for sets of composites with no reliable witnesses."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2735","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2735","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18487","fieldValue":"ACM"}
