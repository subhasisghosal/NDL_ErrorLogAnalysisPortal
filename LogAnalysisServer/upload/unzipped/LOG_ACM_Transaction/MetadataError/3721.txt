This problem occurs frequently in situations in which placing labels directly in the image is impossible or produces too much visual clutter. Examples are annotating maps, photos, or technical\/medical illustrations. Previous algorithmic results for boundary labeling consider a single layer of labels along some or all sides of a rectangular image. If, however, the number of labels is large or the labels are too long, multiple layers of labels are needed. In this article, we study boundary labeling for panorama images, where n points in a rectangle R are to be annotated by disjoint unit-height rectangular labels placed above R in K different rows (or layers). Each point is connected to its label by a vertical leader that does not intersect any other label. We present polynomial time algorithms based on dynamic programming that either minimize the number of rows to place all n labels or maximize the number (or total weight) of labels that can be placed in K rows for a given integer K. For weighted labels, the problem is shown to be (weakly) NP-hard; in this case, we give a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to maximize the weight of the selected labels. We have implemented our algorithms; the experimental results show that solutions for realistically sized instances are computed instantaneously. We have also investigated two-sided panorama labeling, for which the labels may be placed above or below the panorama image. In this model, all of the aforementioned problems are NP-hard. For solving them, we propose mixed-integer linear program formulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21970","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21970","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21971","fieldValue":" With the popularity of mobile devices, spatial crowdsourcing is rising as a new framework that enables human workers to solve tasks in the physical world. With spatial crowdsourcing, the goal is to crowdsource a set of spatiotemporal tasks (i.e., tasks related to time and location) to a set of workers, which requires the workers to physically travel to those locations in order to perform the tasks. In this article, we focus on one class of spatial crowdsourcing, in which the workers send their locations to the server and thereafter the server assigns to every worker tasks in proximity to the workerâ\u20AC™s location with the aim of maximizing the overall number of assigned tasks. We formally define this maximum task assignment (MTA) problem in spatial crowdsourcing, and identify its challenges. We propose alternative solutions to address these challenges by exploiting the spatial properties of the problem space, including the spatial distribution and the travel cost of the workers. MTA is based on the assumptions that all tasks are of the same type and all workers are equally qualified in performing the tasks. Meanwhile, different types of tasks may require workers with various skill sets or expertise. Subsequently, we extend MTA by taking the expertise of the workers into consideration. We refer to this problem as the maximum score assignment (MSA) problem and show its practicality and generality. Extensive experiments with various synthetic and two real-world datasets show the applicability of our proposed framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21971","fieldValue":"ACM"}
