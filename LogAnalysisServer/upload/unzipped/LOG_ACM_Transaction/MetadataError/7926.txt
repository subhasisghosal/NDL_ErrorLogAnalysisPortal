The source is assumed to be powered by a natural renewable source, and the most general case of arbitrarily varying energy arrivals is considered, where neither the future energy arrival instants or amount nor their distribution is known. The fading coefficients are also assumed to be arbitrarily varying over time, with only causal information available at the source. For a maximization problem, the utility of an online algorithm is tested by finding its competitive ratio or competitiveness that is defined to be the maximum of the ratio of the gain of the optimal offline algorithm and the gain of the online algorithm over all input sequences. We show that the lower bound on the optimal competitive ratio for maximizing the achievable rate is arbitrarily close to the number of slots. Conversely, we propose a simple strategy that invests available energy uniformly over all remaining slots until the next energy arrival, and show that its competitive ratio is equal to the number of slots, to conclude that it is an optimal online algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10667","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10667","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10667","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10668","fieldValue":"Hou, I-Hong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10668","fieldValue":" We develop a general approach for designing scheduling policies for real-time traffic over wireless channels. We extend prior work, which characterizes a real-time flow by its traffic pattern, delay bound, timely throughput requirement, and channel reliability, to allow clients to have different deadlines and allow a variety of channel models. In particular, our extended model consider scenarios where channel qualities are time-varying, the access point may not have explicit information on channel qualities, and the access point may or may not employ rate adaptation. Thus, our model allows the treatment of more realistic fading channels as well as scenarios with mobile nodes and the usage of more general transmission strategies. We derive a sufficient condition for a scheduling policy to be feasibility optimal, and thereby establish a class of feasibility optimal policies. We demonstrate the utility of the identified class by deriving a feasibility optimal policy for the scenario with rate adaptation, time-varying channels, and heterogeneous delay bounds. When rate adaptation is not available, we also derive feasibility optimal policies for both scenarios where the access point may or may not have explicit knowledge on channel qualities. For the scenario where rate adaptation is not available but clients have different delay bounds, we describe a heuristic. Simulation results are also presented, which indicate the usefulness of the scheduling policies for more realistic and complex scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10668","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
