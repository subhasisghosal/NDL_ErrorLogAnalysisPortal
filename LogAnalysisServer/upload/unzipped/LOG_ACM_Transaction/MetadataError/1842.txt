The system extends the retrographic sensor [Johnson and Adelson 2009] to the microscopic domain, demonstrating spatial resolution as small as 2 microns. In contrast to existing microgeometry capture techniques, the system is not affected by the optical characteristics of the surface being measured---it captures the same geometry whether the object is matte, glossy, or transparent. In addition, the hardware design allows for a variety of form factors, including a hand-held device that can be used to capture high-resolution surface geometry in the field. We achieve these results with a combination of improved sensor materials, illumination design, and reconstruction algorithm, as compared to the original sensor of Johnson and Adelson [2009]."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16444","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16444","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16445","fieldValue":" We introduce an interactive method to assess cataracts in the human eye by crafting an optical solution that measures the perceptual impact of forward scattering on the foveal region. Current solutions rely on highly-trained clinicians to check the back scattering in the crystallin lens and test their predictions on visual acuity tests. Close-range parallax barriers create collimated beams of light to scan through sub-apertures, scattering light as it strikes a cataract. User feedback generates maps for opacity, attenuation, contrast and sub-aperture point-spread functions. The goal is to allow a general audience to operate a portable high-contrast light-field display to gain a meaningful understanding of their own visual conditions. User evaluations and validation with modified camera optics are performed. Compiled data is used to reconstruct the individual's cataract-affected view, offering a novel approach for capturing information for screening, diagnostic, and clinical analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16445","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16445","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16446","fieldValue":" Stochastic point distributions with blue-noise spectrum are used extensively in computer graphics for various applications such as avoiding aliasing artifacts in ray tracing, halftoning, stippling, etc. In this paper we present a new approach for generating point sets with high-quality blue noise properties that formulates the problem using a statistical mechanics interacting particle model. Points distributions are generated by sampling this model. This new formulation of the problem unifies randomness with the requirement for equidistant point spacing, responsible for the enhanced blue noise spectral properties. We derive a highly efficient multi-scale sampling scheme for drawing random point distributions from this model. The new scheme avoids the critical slowing down phenomena that plagues this type of models. This derivation is accompanied by a model-specific analysis. Altogether, our approach generates high-quality point distributions, supports spatially-varying spatial point density, and runs in time that is linear in the number of points generated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16446","fieldValue":"ACM"}
