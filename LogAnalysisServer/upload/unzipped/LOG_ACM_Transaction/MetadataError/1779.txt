Among existing sampling methods, blue noise sampling remains popular thanks to its spatial uniformity and absence of aliasing artifacts. However, research so far has been mainly focused on blue noise sampling with a single class of samples. This could be insufficient for common natural as well as man-made phenomena requiring multiple classes of samples, such as object placement, imaging sensors, and stippling patterns. We extend blue noise sampling to multiple classes where each individual class as well as their unions exhibit blue noise characteristics. We propose two flavors of algorithms to generate such multi-class blue noise samples, one extended from traditional Poisson hard disk sampling for explicit control of sample spacing, and another based on our soft disk sampling for explicit control of sample count. Our algorithms support uniform and adaptive sampling, and are applicable to both discrete and continuous sample space in arbitrary dimensions. We study characteristics of samples generated by our methods, and demonstrate applications in object placement, sensor layout, and color stippling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16285","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16285","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16286","fieldValue":"Prez, lvaro G."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16286","fieldValue":" Collision detection is a problem that has often been addressed efficiently with the use of hierarchical culling data structures. In the subproblem of self-collision detection for triangle meshes, however, such hierarchical data structures lose much of their power, because triangles adjacent to each other cannot be distinguished from actually colliding ones unless individually tested. Shape regularity of surface patches, described in terms of orientation and contour conditions, was proposed long ago as a culling criterion for hierarchical self-collision detection. However, to date, algorithms based on shape regularity had to trade conservativeness for efficiency, because there was no known algorithm for efficiently performing 2D contour self-intersection tests. In this paper, we introduce a star-contour criterion that is amenable to hierarchical computations. Together with a thorough analysis of the tree traversal process in hierarchical self-collision detection, it has led us to novel hierarchical data structures and algorithms for efficient yet conservative self-collision detection. We demonstrate the application of our algorithm to several example animations, and we show that it consistently outperforms other approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16286","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16286","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16287","fieldValue":" We show how to greatly accelerate self-collision detection (SCD) for reduced deformable models. Given a triangle mesh and a set of deformation modes, our method precomputes Subspace Self-Collision Culling (SSCC) certificates which, if satisfied, prove the absence of self-collisions for large parts of the model. At runtime, bounding volume hierarchies augmented with our certificates can aggressively cull overlap tests and reduce hierarchy updates. Our method supports both discrete and continuous SCD, can handle complex geometry, and makes no assumptions about geometric smoothness or normal bounds. It is particularly effective for simulations with modest subspace deformations, where it can often verify the absence of self-collisions in constant time. Our certificates enable low amortized costs, in time and across many objects in multi-body dynamics simulations. Finally, SSCC is effective enough to support self-collision tests at audio rates, which we demonstrate by producing the first sound simulations of clattering objects."}
