We instead study aggregate user behavior and the retweet graph with a focus on quantitative descriptions. We find that the lifetime tweet distribution is a type-II discrete Weibull stemming from a power law hazard function, that the tweet rate distribution, although asymptotically power law, exhibits a lognormal cutoff over finite sample intervals, and that the inter-tweet interval distribution is a power law with exponential cutoff. The retweet graph is small-world and scale-free, like the social graph, but less disassortative and has much stronger clustering. These differences are consistent with it better capturing the real-world social relationships of and trust between users than the social graph. Beyond just understanding and modeling human communication patterns and social networks, applications for alternative, decentralized microblogging systems---both predicting real-word performance and detecting spam---are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3376","fieldValue":" Proprioception plays a crucial role in enabling humans to move purposively and interact with their physical surroundings. Current technology in upper-limb prostheses, while beginning to incorporate some haptic feedback, does not provide amputees with proprioceptive information about the state of the limb. Thus, the wearer must visually monitor the limb, which is often inconvenient or even impossible for some tasks. This work seeks to quantify the potential benefits of incorporating proprioceptive motion feedback into upper-limb prosthesis designs. We apply a noninvasive method for controlling the availability of proprioceptive motion feedback in unimpaired individuals in a human subject study to compare the benefits of visual and proprioceptive motion feedback in targeted motion tasks. Combined results of the current study and our previous study using a different task indicate that the addition of proprioceptive motion feedback improves targeting accuracy under nonsighted conditions and, for some tasks, under sighted conditions as well. This work motivates the development of methods for providing artificial proprioceptive feedback to a prosthesis wearer."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24497","fieldValue":"Bandara, H M N Dilum"}
