Chips that can autonomously modify their execution and power-dissipation characteristics permit the use of lower-cost cooling solutions while still guaranteeing safe temperature regulation. Evaluating techniques for this dynamic thermal management (DTM), however, requires a thermal model that is practical for architectural studies.This paper describes HotSpot, an accurate yet fast and practical model based on an equivalent circuit of thermal resistances and capacitances that correspond to microarchitecture blocks and essential aspects of the thermal package. Validation was performed using finite-element simulation. The paper also introduces several effective methods for DTM: \"temperature-tracking\" frequency scaling, \"migrating computation\" to spare hardware units, and a \"hybrid\" policy that combines fetch gating with dynamic voltage scaling. The latter two achieve their performance advantage by exploiting instruction-level parallelism, showing the importance of microarchitecture research in helping control the growth of cooling costs.Modeling temperature at the microarchitecture level also shows that power metrics are poor predictors of temperature, that sensor imprecision has a substantial impact on the performance of DTM, and that the inclusion of lateral resistances for thermal diffusion is important for accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6623","fieldValue":"Lim, Seung-Ho"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6623","fieldValue":" Recent development of high-speed wireless networks and embedded systems has enabled the recording and delivery of high-performance multimedia to heterogeneous mobile users. To support heterogeneous mobile users with high-quality multimedia services, scalable video coding was introduced. In the scalable video coding (SVC), through multidimensional scalability, all types of these scalability can be exploited at the same time. However, the generated video sequences of scalable video coding are not adequate for mobile multimedia service systems since its flexibility makes non contiguous storing and retrieval of partial stream data. In this article, we propose efficient scalable video data reorganization for video servicing systems, which consist of video server and mobile clients. For video server, we reorganize scalable video streams taking into account both of decoding dependency and location in disk array storage, where disk array is widely used for storage systems of video server. In the mobile devices, we place substreams with the consideration of NAND flash memory page and block boundaries, which is storage for mobile devices. The experimental results show that the proposed reorganization of scalable video can improve the performance of mobile multimedia service systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6623","fieldValue":"ACM"}
