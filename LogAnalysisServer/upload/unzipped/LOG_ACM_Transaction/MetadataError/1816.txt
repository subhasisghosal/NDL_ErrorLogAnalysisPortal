To date, such dual-stacked LCDs have used heuristic parallax barriers for view-dependent imagery: the front LCD shows a fixed array of slits or pinholes, independent of the multi-view content. While prior works adapt the spacing between slits or pinholes, depending on viewer position, we show both layers can also be adapted to the multi-view content, increasing brightness and refresh rate. Unlike conventional barriers, both masks are allowed to exhibit non-binary opacities. It is shown that any 4D light field emitted by a dual-stacked LCD is the tensor product of two 2D masks. Thus, any pair of 1D masks only achieves a rank-1 approximation of a 2D light field. Temporal multiplexing of masks is shown to achieve higher-rank approximations. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) minimizes the weighted Euclidean distance between a target light field and that emitted by the display. Simulations and experiments characterize the resulting content-adaptive parallax barriers for low-rank light field approximation."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16376","fieldValue":"Content-adaptive parallax barriers: optimizing dual-layer 3D displays using low-rank light field factorization"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16377","fieldValue":"OToole, Matthew"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16377","fieldValue":" We present a general framework for analyzing the transport matrix of a real-world scene at full resolution, without capturing many photos. The key idea is to use projectors and cameras to directly acquire eigenvectors and the Krylov subspace of the unknown transport matrix. To do this, we implement Krylov subspace methods partially in optics, by treating the scene as a \"black box subroutine\" that enables optical computation of arbitrary matrix-vector products. We describe two methods---optical Arnoldi to acquire a low-rank approximation of the transport matrix for relighting; and optical GMRES to invert light transport. Our experiments suggest that good quality relighting and transport inversion are possible from a few dozen low-dynamic range photos, even for scenes with complex shadows, caustics, and other challenging lighting effects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16378","fieldValue":" We demonstrate for the first time a proof of concept projector with a secondary array of individually controllable, analog micromirrors added to improve the contrast and peak brightness of conventional projectors. The micromirrors reallocate the light of the projector lamp from the dark parts towards the light parts of the image, before it reaches the primary image modulator. Each element of the analog micromirror array can be tipped\/tilted to divert portions of the light from the lamp in two dimensions. By directing these mirrors on an image-dependent basis, we can increase both the peak intensity of the projected image as well as its contrast. In this paper, we describe and analyze the optical design for projectors using this light reallocation approach. We also discuss software algorithms to compute the best light reallocation pattern for a given input image, using the constraints of real hardware. We perform extensive simulations of this process to evaluate image quality and performance characteristics of this process. Finally, we present a first proof-of-concept implementation of this approach using a prototype analog micromirror device."}
