Resource usage exceeding the limits specified in the SLA incurs the content provider additional charges, usually at a higher cost. Hence, the content provider's goal is to provision adequate resources in the SLA based on forecasts of future demand. We study capacity purchasing strategies when the content provider employs network coded multicast as the media delivery mechanism, with uncertainty in its future customer set explicitly taken into consideration. The latter requires the content provider to make capacity provisioning decisions based on market predictions and historical customer usage patterns. The probabilistic element suggests a stochastic optimization approach. We model this problem as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem with recourse. Such optimizations are &num;P-hard to solve directly, and we design two approximation algorithms for them. The first is a heuristic algorithm that exploits properties unique to network coding, so that only polynomial-time operations are needed. It performs well in general scenarios, but the gap from the optimal solution is not bounded by any constant in the worst case. This motivates our second approach, a sampling algorithm partly inspired from the work of Gupta et al. [2004a]. We employ techniques from duality theory in linear optimization to prove that the sampling algorithm provides a 3-approximation to the stochastic multicast problem. We conduct extensive simulations to illustrate the efficacy of both algorithms, and show that the performance of both is usually within 10&percnt; of the optimal solution in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25482","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25482","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25483","fieldValue":"Van Der Velden, Joeri"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25483","fieldValue":" Hundreds of millions of people play computer games every day. For them, game contentâ\u20AC\u201Dfrom 3D objects to abstract puzzlesâ\u20AC\u201Dplays a major entertainment role. Manual labor has so far ensured that the quality and quantity of game content matched the demands of the playing community, but is facing new scalability challenges due to the exponential growth over the last decade of both the gamer population and the production costs. Procedural Content Generation for Games (PCG-G) may address these challenges by automating, or aiding in, game content generation. PCG-G is difficult, since the generator has to create the content, satisfy constraints imposed by the artist, and return interesting instances for gamers. Despite a large body of research focusing on PCG-G, particularly over the past decade, ours is the first comprehensive survey of the field of PCG-G. We first introduce a comprehensive, six-layered taxonomy of game content: bits, space, systems, scenarios, design, and derived. Second, we survey the methods used across the whole field of PCG-G from a large research body. Third, we map PCG-G methods to game content layers; it turns out that many of the methods used to generate game content from one layer can be used to generate content from another. We also survey the use of methods in practice, that is, in commercial or prototype games. Fourth and last, we discuss several directions for future research in PCG-G, which we believe deserve close attention in the near future."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25484","fieldValue":"Ji, Rong-Rong"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25484","fieldValue":"Hua, Xian-Sheng"}
