Images captured in natural environments with varied weather conditions frequently exhibit localized light sources or color-shift effects. The occurrence of these effects presents a difficult challenge for hazy image restoration, with which many traditional restoration methods cannot adequately contend. In this article, we present a new image haze removal approach based on Fisher's linear discriminant-based dual dark channel prior scheme in order to solve the problems associated with the presence of localized light sources and color shifts, and thereby achieve effective restoration. Experimental restoration results via qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our proposed approach can provide higher haze-removal efficacy for images captured in varied weather conditions than can the other state-of-the-art approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25690","fieldValue":"Bao, Bing-Kun"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25690","fieldValue":" With the explosive growth of online media platforms in recent years, it becomes more and more attractive to provide users a solution of emerging topic detection and elaboration. And this posts a real challenge to both industrial and academic researchers because of the overwhelming information available in multiple modalities and with large outlier noises. This article provides a method on emerging topic detection and elaboration using multimedia streams cross different online platforms. Specifically, Twitter, New York Times and Flickr are selected for the work to represent the microblog, news portal and imaging sharing platforms. The emerging keywords of Twitter are firstly extracted using aging theory. Then, to overcome the nature of short length message in microblog, Robust Cross-Platform Multimedia Co-Clustering (RCPMM-CC) is proposed to detect emerging topics with three novelties: 1) The data from different media platforms are in multimodalities; 2) The coclustering is processed based on a pairwise correlated structure, in which the involved three media platforms are pairwise dependent; 3) The noninformative samples are automatically pruned away at the same time of coclustering. In the last step of cross-platform elaboration, we enrich each emerging topic with the samples from New York Times and Flickr by computing the implicit links between social topics and samples from selected news and Flickr image clusters, which are obtained by RCPMM-CC. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25691","fieldValue":" Video dissemination over Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks is an attractive technology that supports many novel applications. The merit of this work lies in the design of an efficient video dissemination protocol that provides high video quality at different data rates for urban scenarios. Our objective is to improve received video quality while meeting delay and packet loss. In this work, we first employ a reliable scheme known as connected dominating set, which is an efficient receiver-based routing scheme for broadcasting video content. To avoid repeated computing of the connected dominating set, we add three statuses to each node. In nonscalable video coding, the distribution of lost frames can cause a major impact on video quality at the receiver's end. Therefore, for the second step, we employ Interleaving to spread out the burst losses and to reduce the influence of loss distributions. Although Interleaving can reduce the influence of cluster frame loss, single packet loss is also a concern due to collisions, and to intermittent disconnection in the topology. In order to fix these single packet losses, we propose a store-carry-forward scheme for the nodes in order to retransmit the local buffer stored packets. The results, when compared to the selected base protocols, show that our proposed protocol is an efficient solution for video dissemination over urban Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks."}
