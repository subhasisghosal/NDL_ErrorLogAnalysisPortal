In this article we present a smoothed analysis of the number of left-to-right maxima in the presence of additive random noise. We show that for every sequence of n numbers si$ âˆˆ [0,1] that are perturbed by uniform noise from the interval [-&epsi;,&epsi;], the expected number of left-to-right maxima is Î˜(&sqrt;n\/&epsi; + log n) for &epsi;>1\/n. For Gaussian noise with standard deviation Ïƒ we obtain a bound of $O((log^3\/2$ n)\/Ïƒ + log n). We apply our results to the analysis of the smoothed height of binary search trees and the smoothed number of comparisons in the quicksort algorithm and prove bounds of Î˜(&sqrt;n\/&epsi; + log n) and Î˜(n\/&epsi;+1&sqrt;n\/&epsi; + n log n), respectively, for uniform random noise from the interval [-&epsi;,&epsi;]. Our results can also be applied to bound the smoothed number of points on a convex hull of points in the two-dimensional plane and to smoothed motion complexity, a concept we describe in this article. We bound how often one needs to update a data structure storing the smallest axis-aligned box enclosing a set of points moving in d-dimensional space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16319","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16319","fieldValue":" Limited spatial resolution of current displays makes the depiction of very fine spatial details difficult. This work proposes a novel method applied to moving images that takes into account the human visual system and leads to an improved perception of such details. To this end, we display images rapidly varying over time along a given trajectory on a high refresh rate display. Due to the retinal integration time the information is fused and yields apparent super-resolution pixels on a conventional-resolution display. We discuss how to find optimal temporal pixel variations based on linear eye-movement and image content and extend our solution to arbitrary trajectories. This step involves an efficient method to predict and successfully treat potentially visible flickering. Finally, we evaluate the resolution enhancement in a perceptual study that shows that significant improvements can be achieved both for computer generated images and photographs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16319","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16319","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16320","fieldValue":" Large scale fluid simulation can be difficult using existing techniques due to the high computational cost of using large grids. We present a novel technique for simulating detailed fluids quickly. Our technique coarsens the Eulerian fluid grid during the pressure solve, allowing for a fast implicit update but still maintaining the resolution obtained with a large grid. This allows our simulations to run at a fraction of the cost of existing techniques while still providing the fine scale structure and details obtained with a full projection. Our algorithm scales well to very large grids and large numbers of processors, allowing for high fidelity simulations that would otherwise be intractable."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16320","fieldValue":"ACM"}
