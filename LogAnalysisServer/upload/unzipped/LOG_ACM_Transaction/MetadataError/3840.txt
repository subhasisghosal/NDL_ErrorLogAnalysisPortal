Existing studies rely on annotated training data, which is quite expensive to obtain large datasets, limiting the effectiveness of recognition. In this research, we propose a semisupervised learning approach for web named entity recognition (NER) model construction via automatic labeling and tri-training. The former utilizes structured resources containing known named entities for automatic labeling, while the latter makes use of unlabeled examples to improve the extraction performance. Since this automatically labeled training data may contain noise, a self-testing procedure is used as a follow-up to remove low-confidence annotation and prepare higher-quality training data. Furthermore, we modify tri-training for sequence labeling and derive a proper initialization for large dataset training to improve entity recognition. Finally, we apply this semisupervised learning framework for person name recognition, business organization name recognition, and location name extraction. In the task of Chinese NER, an F-measure of 0.911, 0.849, and 0.845 can be achieved, for person, business organization, and location NER, respectively. The same framework is also applied for English and Japanese business organization name recognition and obtains models with performance of a 0.832 and 0.803 F-measure."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22345","fieldValue":"Gorantla, M C"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22345","fieldValue":" Two-party key exchange (2PKE) protocols have been rigorously analyzed under various models considering different adversarial actions. However, the analysis of group key exchange (GKE) protocols has not been as extensive as that of 2PKE protocols. Particularly, an important security attribute called key compromise impersonation (KCI) resilience has been completely ignored for the case of GKE protocols. Informally, a protocol is said to provide KCI resilience if the compromise of the long-term secret key of a protocol participant A does not allow the adversary to impersonate an honest participant B to A. In this paper, we argue that KCI resilience for GKE protocols is at least as important as it is for 2PKE protocols. Our first contribution is revised definitions of security for GKE protocols considering KCI attacks by both outsider and insider adversaries. We also give a new proof of security for an existing two-round GKE protocol under the revised security definitions assuming random oracles. We then show how to achieve insider KCIR in a generic way using a known compiler in the literature. As one may expect, this additional security assurance comes at the cost of an extra round of communication. Finally, we show that a few existing protocols are not secure against outsider KCI attacks. The attacks on these protocols illustrate the necessity of considering KCI resilience for GKE protocols."}
