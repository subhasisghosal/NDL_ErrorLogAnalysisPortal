Functionality in CPS emerges from the interaction of networked computational and physical objects. System design and integration are particularly challenging because fundamentally different physical and computational design concerns intersect. The impact of these interactions is the loss of compositionality which creates tremendous challenges. The key idea in this article is to use passivity for decoupling the control design of networked systems from uncertainties such as time delays and packet loss, thus providing a fundamental simplification strategy that limits the complexity of interactions. The main contribution is the application of the approach to an experimental case study of a networked multi-robot system. We present a networked control architecture that ensures the overall system remains stable in spite of implementation uncertainties such as network delays and data dropouts, focusing on the technical details required for the implementation. We describe a prototype domain-specific modeling language and automated code generation tools for the design of networked control systems on top of passivity that facilitate effective system configuration, deployment, and testing. Finally, we present experimental evaluation results that show decoupling of interlayer interactions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6582","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6582","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6583","fieldValue":" A joint optimization of the physical system and the cyber world is one of the key problems in the design of a cyber-physical system (CPS). The major mechanical forces and\/or chemical reactions in a plant are commonly modified by actuators in the balance-of-plant (BOP) system. More powerful actuators requires more power, but generally increase the response of the physical system powered by the electrical energy generated by the physical system. To maximize the overall output of a power generating plant therefore requires joint optimization of the physical system and the cyber world, and this is a key factor in the design of a CPS. We introduce a systematic approach to the modeling and synthesis of a CPS that emphasize joint power optimization, using an active direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) as a case study. Active DMFC systems are superior to passive DMFCs in terms of fuel efficiency thanks to their BOP system, which includes pumps, air blowers, and fans. However, designing a small-scale active DMFC with the best overall system efficiency requires the BOP system to be jointly optimized with the DMFC stack operation, because the BOP components are powered by the stack. Our approach to this synthesis problem involves i) BOP system characterization, ii) integrated DMFC system modeling, iii) configuring a system for the maximum net power output through design space exploration, iv) synthesis of feedback control tasks, and v) implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6583","fieldValue":"Control-theoretic cyber-physical system modeling and synthesis: A case study of an active direct methanol fuel cell"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6583","fieldValue":"ACM"}
