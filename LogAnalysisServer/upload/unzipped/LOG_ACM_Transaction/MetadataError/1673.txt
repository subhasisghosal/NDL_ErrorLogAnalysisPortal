{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16014","fieldValue":" In this paper we describe a method for directly deducing new interpolating subdivision masks for meshes from corresponding approximating subdivision masks. The purpose is to avoid complex computation for producing interpolating subdivision masks on extraordinary vertices. The method can be applied to produce new interpolating subdivision schemes, solve some limitations in existing interpolating subdivision schemes and satisfy some application needs. As cases, in this paper a new interpolating subdivision scheme for polygonal meshes is produced by deducing from the Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme. It can directly operate on polygonal meshes, which solves the limitation of Kobbelt's interpolating subdivision scheme. A new √3 interpolating subdivision scheme for triangle meshes and a new √2 interpolating subdivision scheme for quadrilateral meshes are also presented in the paper by deducing from √3 subdivision schemes and 4-8 subdivision schemes respectively. They both produce $C^1$ continuous limit surfaces and avoid the blemish in the existing interpolating √3 and √2 subdivision masks where the weight coefficients on extraordinary vertices can not be described by formulation explicitly. In addition, by adding a parameter to control the transition from approximation to interpolation, they can produce surfaces intervening between approximating and interpolating which can be used to solve the \"popping effect\" problem when switching between meshes at different levels of resolution. They can also force surfaces to interpolate chosen vertices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16015","fieldValue":" This paper presents a new quadrangulation algorithm, extending the spectral surface quadrangulation approach where the coarse quadrangular structure is derived from the Morse-Smale complex of an eigenfunction of the Laplacian operator on the input mesh. In contrast to the original scheme, we provide flexible explicit controls of the shape, size, orientation and feature alignment of the quadrangular faces. We achieve this by proper selection of the optimal eigenvalue (shape), by adaption of the area term in the Laplacian operator (size), and by adding special constraints to the Laplace eigenproblem (orientation and alignment). By solving a generalized eigen-problem we can generate a scalar field on the mesh whose Morse-Smale complex is of high quality and satisfies all the user requirements. The final quadrilateral mesh is generated from the Morse-Smale complex by computing a globally smooth parametrization. Here we additionally introduce edge constraints to preserve user specified feature lines accurately."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16016","fieldValue":" We introduce a simplification algorithm for meshes composed of quadrilateral elements. It is reminiscent of edge-collapse based methods for triangle meshes, but takes a novel approach to the challenging problem of maintaining the quadrilateral connectivity during level-of-detail creation. The method consists of a set of unit operations applied to the dual of the mesh, each designed to improve mesh structure and maintain topological genus. Geometric shape is maintained by an extension of a quadric error metric to quad meshes. The technique is straightforward to implement and efficient enough to be applied to real-world models. Our technique can handle models with sharp features, and can be used to re-mesh general polygonal, i.e. tri- and quad-dominant, meshes into quadonly meshes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16016","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16016","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16017","fieldValue":" In this paper, we introduce a system to virtually restore damaged or historically significant objects without needing to physically change the object in any way. Our work addresses both creating a restored synthetic version of the object as viewed from a camera and projecting the necessary light, using digital projectors, to give the illusion of the object being restored. The restoration algorithm uses an energy minimization method to enforce a set of criteria over the surface of the object and provides an interactive tool to the user which can compute a restoration in a few minutes. The visual compensation method develops a formulation that is particularly concerned with obtaining bright compensations under a specified maximum amount of light. The bound on the amount of light is of crucial importance when viewing and restoring old and potentially fragile objects. Finally, we demonstrate our system by restoring several deteriorated and old objects enabling the observer to view the original or restored object at will."}
