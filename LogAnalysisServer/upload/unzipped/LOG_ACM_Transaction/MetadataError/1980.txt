Although much attention has been devoted to the modeling of aging and weathering phenomena over the last decade, comparatively little attention has been paid to fading effects. In this article, we present a theoretical framework for the physically based simulation of time-dependent spectral changes induced by absorbed radiation. This framework relies on the general volumetric radiative transfer theory, and it employs a physicochemical approach to account for variations in the absorptive properties of colorants. Employing this framework, a layered fading model that can be readily integrated into existing rendering systems is developed using the Kubelka-Munk theory. We evaluate its correctness through comparisons of measured and simulated fading results. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this model through renderings depicting typical fading scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16802","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16802","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2592","fieldValue":"Stengel, Bernhard von"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2592","fieldValue":" The list update problem is a classical online problem, with an optimal competitive ratio that is still open, known to be somewhere between 1.5 and 1.6. An algorithm with competitive ratio 1.6, the smallest known to date, is COMB, a randomized combination of BIT and the TIMESTAMP algorithm TS. This and almost all other list update algorithms, like MTF, are projective in the sense that they can be defined by looking only at any pair of list items at a time. Projectivity (also known as â\u20ACœlist factoringâ\u20AC?) simplifies both the description of the algorithm and its analysis, and so far seems to be the only way to define a good online algorithm for lists of arbitrary length. In this article, we characterize all projective list update algorithms and show that their competitive ratio is never smaller than 1.6 in the partial cost model. Therefore, COMB is a best possible projective algorithm in this model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2592","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2592","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16803","fieldValue":" Materials such as clothing or carpets, or complex assemblies of small leaves, flower petals, or mosses, do not fit well into either BRDF or BSSRDF models. Their appearance is a complex combination of reflection, transmission, scattering, shadowing, and inter-reflection. This complexity can be handled by simulating the full volumetric light transport within these materials by Monte Carlo algorithms, but there is no easy way to construct the necessary distributions of local material properties thatwould lead to the desired global appearance. In this article, we consider one way to alleviate the problem: an editing algorithm that enables a material designer to set the local (singlescattering) albedo coefficients interactively, and see an immediate update of the emergent appearance in the image. This is a difficult problem, since the function from materials to pixel values is neither linear nor low-order polynomial. We combine the following two ideas to achieve high-dimensional heterogeneous edits: precomputing the homogeneous mapping of albedo to intensity, and a large Jacobian matrix, which encodes the derivatives of each image pixel with respect to each albedo coefficient. Combining these two datasets leads to an interactive editing algorithm with a very good visual match to a fully path-traced ground truth."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16803","fieldValue":"ACM"}
