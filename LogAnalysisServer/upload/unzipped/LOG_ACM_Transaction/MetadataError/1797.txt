A gesture controller is an optimal-policy controller that schedules gesture animations in real time based on acoustic features in the user's speech. The controller consists of an inference layer, which infers a distribution over a set of hidden states from the speech signal, and a control layer, which selects the optimal motion based on the inferred state distribution. The inference layer, consisting of a specialized conditional random field, learns the hidden structure in body language style and associates it with acoustic features in speech. The control layer uses reinforcement learning to construct an optimal policy for selecting motion clips from a distribution over the learned hidden states. The modularity of the proposed method allows customization of a character's gesture repertoire, animation of non-human characters, and the use of additional inputs such as speech recognition or direct user control."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16330","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16330","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16331","fieldValue":" Traditional image compositing techniques, such as alpha matting and gradient domain compositing, are used to create composites that have plausible boundaries. But when applied to images taken from different sources or shot under different conditions, these techniques can produce unrealistic results. In this work, we present a framework that explicitly matches the visual appearance of images through a process we call image harmonization, before blending them. At the heart of this framework is a multi-scale technique that allows us to transfer the appearance of one image to another. We show that by carefully manipulating the scales of a pyramid decomposition of an image, we can match contrast, texture, noise, and blur, while avoiding image artifacts. The output composite can then be reconstructed from the modified pyramid coefficients while enforcing both alpha-based and seamless boundary constraints. We show how the proposed framework can be used to produce realistic composites with minimal user interaction in a number of different scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16331","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16331","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16332","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16332","fieldValue":" We present an easy-to-use image retouching technique for realistic reshaping of human bodies in a single image. A model-based approach is taken by integrating a 3D whole-body morphable model into the reshaping process to achieve globally consistent editing effects. A novel body-aware image warping approach is introduced to reliably transfer the reshaping effects from the model to the image, even under moderate fitting errors. Thanks to the parametric nature of the model, our technique parameterizes the degree of reshaping by a small set of semantic attributes, such as weight and height. It allows easy creation of desired reshaping effects by changing the full-body attributes, while producing visually pleasing results even for loosely-dressed humans in casual photographs with a variety of poses and shapes."}
