The objective of this work is to enable effective search and discovery of Web content using social bookmarking tags. Tags are metadata generated by users for Web content annotation. Their potential as effective Web search and discovery tool is hindered by challenges such as, the tag space being untidy due to ambiguity, and hidden or implicit semantics. Using a novel analytics approach, we conducted network analyses on tags and discovered that tags are generated for different purposes and that there are inherent relationships among tags. Our approach can be used to extract the purposes of tags and relationships among the tags and this information can be used as facets to add structure and hierarchy to reorganize the flat tag space. The semantics of relationships and hierarchy in our proposed faceted model of tags enable searches on annotated Web content in an effective manner. We describe the implementation of a prototype system called FASTS to demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8176","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8176","fieldValue":"Using a Network Analysis Approach for Organizing Social Bookmarking Tags and Enabling Web Content Discovery"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8176","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8176","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8177","fieldValue":" By using online retail data collected from Amazon, Barnes & Nobel, and Pricegrabber, this paper investigates whether online vendorsâ\u20AC™â\u20AC™ pricing decisions fully reflect the information contained in various components of customersâ\u20AC™ online reviews. The findings suggest that there is inefficiency in vendorsâ\u20AC™ pricing decisions. Specifically, vendors do not appear to fully understand the incremental predictive power of online reviews in forecasting future sales when they adjust their prices. However, they do understand demand persistence. Interestingly, vendors reduce price if the actual demand is higher than the expected demand (positive demand shock). This phenomenon is attributed to the advertising effect suggested in previous literature and the intense competitiveness of e-Commerce. Finally, we document that vendors do not change their prices directly in response to online reviews; their response to online reviews is through forecasting consumerâ\u20AC™s future demand."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8177","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8177","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8177","fieldValue":"ACM"}
