Although recent developments have slightly exceeded previous methods of SS prediction, accuracy has stagnated around 80 percent and many wonder if prediction cannot be advanced beyond this ceiling. Disciplines that have traditionally employed neural networks are experimenting with novel deep learning techniques in attempts to stimulate progress. Since neural networks have historically played an important role in SS prediction, we wanted to determine whether deep learning could contribute to the advancement of this field as well. We developed an SS predictor that makes use of the position-specific scoring matrix generated by PSI-BLAST and deep learning network architectures, which we call DNSS. Graphical processing units and CUDA software optimize the deep network architecture and efficiently train the deep networks. Optimal parameters for the training process were determined, and a workflow comprising three separately trained deep networks was constructed in order to make refined predictions. This deep learning network approach was used to predict SS for a fully independent test dataset of 198 proteins, achieving a Q3 accuracy of 80.7 percent and a Sov accuracy of 74.2 percent."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5187","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5188","fieldValue":" Various strategies can be used to select representative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a large number of SNPs, such as tag SNP for haplotype coverage and informative SNP for haplotype reconstruction, respectively. Representative SNPs are not only instrumental in reducing the cost of genotyping, but also serve an important function in narrowing the combinatorial space in epistasis analysis. The capacity of kernel SNPs to unify informative SNP and tag SNP is explored, and inconsistencies are minimized in further studies. The correlation between multiple SNPs is formalized using multi-information measures. In extending the correlation, a distance formula for measuring the similarity between clusters is first designed to conduct hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering consists of both information gain and haplotype diversity, so that the proposed approach can achieve unification. The kernel SNPs are then selected from every cluster through the top rank or backward elimination scheme. Using these kernel SNPs, extensive experimental comparisons are conducted between informative SNPs on haplotype reconstruction accuracy and tag SNPs on haplotype coverage. Results indicate that the kernel SNP can practically unify informative SNP and tag SNP and is therefore adaptable to various applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5188","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5188","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5188","fieldValue":"ACM"}
