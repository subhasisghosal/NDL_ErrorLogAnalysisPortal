Our approach, which is implemented on a standard Linux platform, and which we call ADvanced Wi-fi Internet Service EnhanceR (ADWISER), is an extension of our previous system WLAN Manager (WM). ADWISER addresses several infrastructure WLAN performance anomalies such as mixed-rate inefficiency, unfair medium sharing between simultaneous TCP uploads and downloads, and inefficient utilization of the Internet access bandwidth when Internet transfers compete with LAN-WLAN transfers, etc. The approach is via centralized queueing and scheduling, using a novel, configurable, cascaded packet queueing and scheduling architecture, with an adaptive service rate. In this paper, we describe the design of ADWISER and report results of extensive experimentation conducted on a hybrid testbed consisting of real end-systems and an emulated WLAN on Qualnet. We also present results from a physical testbed consisting of one access point (AP) and a few end-systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10450","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10450","fieldValue":"Experiences with a centralized scheduling approach for performance management of IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10450","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10450","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10451","fieldValue":" Almost all geographic routing protocols have been designed for 2-D. We present a novel geographic routing protocol, named Multihop Delaunay Triangulation (MDT), for 2-D, 3-D, and higher dimensions with these properties: 1) guaranteed delivery for any connected graph of nodes and physical links, and 2) low routing stretch from efficient forwarding of packets out of local minima. The guaranteed delivery property holds for node locations specified by accurate, inaccurate, or arbitrary coordinates. The MDT protocol suite includes a packet forwarding protocol together with protocols for nodes to construct and maintain a distributed MDT for routing. We present the performance of MDT protocols in 3-D and 4-D as well as performance comparisons of MDT routing versus representative geographic routing protocols for nodes in 2-D and 3-D. Experimental results show that MDT provides the lowest routing stretch in the comparisons. Furthermore, MDT protocols are specially designed to handle churn, i.e., dynamic topology changes due to addition and deletion of nodes and links. Experimental results show that MDT's routing success rate is close to 100% during churn, and node states converge quickly to a correct MDT after churn."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10451","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10451","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10451","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8411","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
