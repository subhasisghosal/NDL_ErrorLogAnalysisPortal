We consider system performance under a many-user asymptotic. We distinguish two scenarios, namely \"Distributed Server Networks\" (DSNs) for which requests are exogenous to the system, and \"Pure P2P Networks\" (PP2PNs) for which requests emanate from the peers themselves. For both scenarios, we consider a loss network model of performance and determine asymptotically optimal content placement strategies in the case of a limited content catalog. We then turn to an alternative \"large catalog\" scaling where the catalog size scales with the peer population. Under this scaling, we establish that storage space per peer must necessarily grow unboundedly if bandwidth utilization is to be maximized. Relating the system performance to properties of a specific random graph model, we then identify a content placement strategy and a request acceptance policy that jointly maximize bandwidth utilization, provided storage space per peer grows unboundedly, although arbitrarily slowly, with system size."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10444","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10444","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10444","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10445","fieldValue":"De A Rocha, Antonio A."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10445","fieldValue":" BitTorrent, the immensely popular file swarming system, suffers a fundamental problem: content unavailability. Although swarming scales well to tolerate flash crowds for popular content, it is less useful for unpopular content as peers arriving after the initial rush find it unavailable. In this paper, we present a model to quantify content availability in swarming systems. We use the model to analyze the availability and the performance implications of bundling, a strategy commonly adopted by many BitTorrent publishers today. We find that even a limited amount of bundling exponentially reduces content unavailability. For swarms with highly unavailable publishers, the availability gain of bundling can result in a net decrease in average download time. We empirically confirm the model's conclusions through experiments on PlanetLab using the Mainline BitTorrent client."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10445","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10445","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10445","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10446","fieldValue":" Opportunistic routing aims to improve wireless performance by exploiting communication opportunities arising by chance. A key challenge in opportunistic routing is how to achieve good, predictable performance despite the incidental nature of such communication opportunities and the complicated effects of wireless interference in IEEE 802.11 networks. To address the challenge, we develop a model-driven optimization framework to jointly optimize opportunistic routes and rate limits for both unicast and multicast traffic. A distinctive feature of our framework is that the performance derived from optimization can be achieved in a real IEEE 802.11 network. Our framework consists of three key components: 1) a model for capturing the interference among IEEE 802.11 broadcast transmissions; 2) a novel algorithm for accurately optimizing different performance objectives; and 3) effective techniques for mapping the resulting solutions to practical routing configurations. Extensive simulations and testbed experiments show that our approach significantly out-performs state-of-the-art shortest-path routing and opportunistic routing protocols. Moreover, the difference between the achieved performance and our model estimation is typically within 20%. Evaluation in dynamic and uncontrolled environments further shows that our approach is robust against inaccuracy introduced by a dynamic network and it also consistently outperforms the existing schemes. These results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach."}
