In many software programs, global matching algorithms are used in order to obtain accurate disparity maps. Although their error rates are considerably low, their processing speeds are far from that required for real-time processing because of their complex processing sequences. In order to realize real-time processing, many hardware systems have been proposed to date. They have achieved considerably high processing speeds; however, their error rates are not as good as those of software programs, because simple local matching algorithms have been widely used in those systems. In our system, sophisticated local matching algorithms (CA and FLC) that are suitable for FPGA implementation are used to achieve low error rate while maintaining the high processing speed. We evaluate the performance of our circuit on Xilinx Vertex-6 FPGAs. Its error rate is comparable to that of top-level software algorithms, and its processing speed is nearly 2 clock cycles per pixel, which reaches 507.9 fps for 640 480 pixel images."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21846","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21847","fieldValue":"Bahar, R Iris"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21847","fieldValue":" The ease-of-use and reconfigurability of FPGAs makes them an attractive platform for accelerating algorithms. However, accelerating becomes a challenging task as the large number of possible design parameters lead to different accelerator variants. In this article, we propose techniques for fast design exploration and multi-objective optimization to quickly identify both algorithmic and hardware parameters that optimize these accelerators. This information is used to run regression analysis and train mathematical models within a nonlinear optimization framework to identify the optimal algorithm and design parameters under various objectives and constraints. To automate and improve the model generation process, we propose the use of $L_1$-regularized least squares regression techniques.We implement two real-time image processing accelerators as test cases: one for image deblurring and one for block matching. For these designs, we demonstrate that by sampling only a small fraction of the design space (0.42&percnt; and 1.1&percnt;), our modeling techniques are accurate within 2&percnt;--4&percnt; for area and throughput, 8&percnt;--9&percnt; for power, and 5&percnt;--6&percnt; for arithmetic accuracy. We show speedups of 340Ã\u2014 and 90Ã\u2014 in time for the test cases compared to brute-force enumeration. We also identify the optimal set of parameters for a number of scenarios (e.g., minimizing power under arithmetic inaccuracy bounds)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21847","fieldValue":"ACM"}
