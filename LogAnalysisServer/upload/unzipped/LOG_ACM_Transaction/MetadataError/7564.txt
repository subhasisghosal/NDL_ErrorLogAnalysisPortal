In this paper, we develop a polynomial-time algorithmic framework, called graded channel reservation (GCR), to support the implementation of such architectures. This framework enables users to specify minimum bandwidth and duration requirements for their connections. Upon receiving a request, GCR returns the highest graded path, selected according to a general, multicriteria optimization objective. In particular, if the optimization criterion is delay, we prove that GCR returns the earliest time available to establish the connection. Thereafter, we present a generalization of GCR, called GCRswitch, that is capable of supporting path switching throughout a connection. We present practical methods for minimizing or limiting the number of path switches. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of GCR and its variants under various topological settings and applications workload. Our results show that, for certain traffic parameters, optimized path selection combined with path switching can reduce the average delay of requests by an order of magnitude and increase the maximum sustainable load by as much as 50%."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9936","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9936","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9936","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8390","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9937","fieldValue":"Andrew, Lachlan L H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9937","fieldValue":" We prove that the XCP equilibrium solves a constrained max-min fairness problem by identifying it with the unique solution of a hierarchy of optimization problems, namely those solved by max-min fair allocation, but solved by XCP under an additional constraint. This constraint is due to the \"bandwidth shuffling\" necessary to obtain fairness. We describe an algorithm to compute this equilibrium and derive a lower and upper bound on link utilization. While XCP reduces to max-min allocation at a single link, its behavior in a network can be very different. We illustrate that the additional constraint can cause flows to receive an arbitrarily small fraction of their max-min fair allocations. We confirm these results using ns2 simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9937","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9937","fieldValue":"ACM"}
