They often refer to the items signified by either a gesture or visual means. In this article we classify referring expressions into two types (i.e., a deictic reference and an anaphoric reference), and propose two general methods to resolve these referring expressions. One method is a simple mapping algorithm that can find items referred with\/without pointing gestures on a screen. The other is the centering algorithm with a dual cache model, to which Walker's centering algorithm is extended for a multimodal dialogue system. The extended algorithm is appropriate for resolving various anaphoric references in a multimodal dialogue. In the experiments, the proposed system correctly resolved 376 out of 405 referring expressions in 40 dialogues (0.54 referring expressions per utterance) showing 92.84 percent correctness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2831","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2831","fieldValue":"ACM"}
