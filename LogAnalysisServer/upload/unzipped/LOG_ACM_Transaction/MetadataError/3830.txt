The underlying definitions, which are based on the idea of indistinguishability between two worlds, provide new insights into the relation between, and the fundamental structure of, different privacy notions. We furthermore place previous privacy definitions concerning group signature, anonymous communication, and secret voting systems in the context of our hierarchy; this renders these traditionally disconnected notions comparable."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22322","fieldValue":" We present a novel video stream authentication scheme which combines signature amortization by means of hash chains and an advanced watermarking technique. We propose a new hash chain construction, the Duplex Hash Chain, which allows us to achieve bit-by-bit authentication that is robust to low bit error rates. This construction is well suited for wireless broadcast communications characterized by low packet losses such as in satellite networks. Moreover, neither hardware upgrades nor specific end-user equipment are needed to enjoy the authentication services. The computation overhead experienced on the receiver only sums to two hashes per block of pictures and one digital signature verification for the whole received stream. This overhead introduces a provably negligible decrease in video quality. A thorough analysis of the proposed solution is provided in conjunction with extensive simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22322","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22322","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22323","fieldValue":" We present a new technique that can trace data provenance and enforce data access policies across multiple applications and machines. We have developed Garm, a tool that uses binary rewriting to implement this technique on arbitrary binaries. Users can use Garm to attach access policies to data and Garm enforces the policy on all accesses to the data (and any derived data) across all applications and executions. Garm uses static analysis to generate optimized instrumentation that traces the provenance of an application's state and the policies that apply to this state. Garm monitors the interactions of the application with the underlying operating system to enforce policies. Conceptually, Garm combines trusted computing support from the underlying operating system with a stream cipher to ensure that data protected by an access policy cannot be accessed outside of Garm's policy enforcement mechanisms. We have evaluated Garm with several common Linux applications. We found that Garm can successfully trace the provenance of data across executions of multiple applications and enforce data access policies on the application's executions."}
