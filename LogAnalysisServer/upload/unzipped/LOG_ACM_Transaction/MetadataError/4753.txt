{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25319","fieldValue":" The research area of interactive digital TV is in the midst of a significant revival. Unlike the first generation of digital TV, which focused on producer concerns that effectively limited (re)distribution, the current generation of research is closely linked to the role of the user in selecting, producing, and distributing content. The research field of interactive digital television is being transformed into a study of human-centered television. Our guest editorial reviews relevant aspects of this transformation in the three main stages of the content lifecycle: content production, content delivery, and content consumption. While past research on content production tools focused on full-fledged authoring tools for professional editors, current research studies lightweight, often informal end-user authoring systems. In terms of content delivery, user-oriented infrastructures such as peer-to-peer are being seen as alternatives to more traditional broadcast solutions. Moreover, end-user interaction is no longer limited to content selection, but now facilitates nonlinear participatory television productions. Finally, user-to-user communication technologies have allowed television to become a central component of an interconnected social experience. The background context given in this article provides a framework for appreciating the significance of four detailed contributions that highlight important directions in transforming interactive television research."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25319","fieldValue":"Introduction to special issue: Human-centered televisionâ\u20AC\u201Ddirections in interactive digital television research"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25319","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25319","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25320","fieldValue":" This article is motivated by the question whether television should do more than simply offer interactive services alongside (and separately from) traditional linear programs, in the context of its dominance being seriously challenged and threatened by interactive forms of screen media entertainment. It suggests: yes. Interactive narrativity, that is, the ability to interact with (and influence) stories whilst they are being told, represents one clear development path for interactive television. The capabilities of computing technology are ripe for exploring this new form of storytelling, from creation to commercial distribution. The article starts by looking at the relationship between narrativity and interactivity in the current context of screen media, and identifies clear signs of interest from certain European public broadcasters in interactive TV narratives. It then presents in detail four recent experimental interactive TV productions in the genres of drama, news, and documentary, developed in collaboration with public broadcasters, which illustrate the potential and richness of this new form of storytelling, but also highlight new technological capabilities necessary for such productions. A number of essential technological requirements are then discussed in more detail in the final part. The article suggests that the ShapeShifting Media Technology, employed in the implementation of the four productions, has made significant advances both at the technological and the creative ends in supporting the development of interactive TV narrativity, but, however, that further developments are required before being able to answer questions such as â\u20ACœWould end users want such a form of screen media entertainment&quest;â\u20AC? and â\u20ACœWould it be effective for both end users and producers&quest;â\u20AC?"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25321","fieldValue":" Video-on-Demand (VoD) is a compelling application, but costly. VoD is costly due to the load it places on video source servers. Many have proposed using peer-to-peer (P2P) techniques to shift load from servers to peers. Yet, nobody has implemented and deployed a system to openly and systematically evaluate how these techniques work. This article describes the design, implementation and evaluation of GridCast, a real deployed P2P VoD system. GridCast has been live on CERNET since May of 2006. It provides seek, pause, and play operations, and employs peer sharing to improve system scalability. In peak months, GridCast has served videos to 23,000 unique users. From the first deployment, we have gathered information to understand the system and evaluate how to further improve peer sharing through caching and replication. We first show that GridCast with single video caching (SVC) can decrease load on source servers by an average of 22&percnt; from a client-server architecture. We analyze the net effect on system resources and determine that peer upload is largely idle. This leads us to changing the caching algorithm to cache multiple videos (MVC). MVC decreases source load by an average of 51&percnt; over the client-server. The improvement is greater as user load increases. This bodes well for peer-assistance at larger scales. A detailed analysis of MVC shows that departure misses become a major issue in a P2P VoD system with caching optimization. Motivated by this observation, we examine how to use replication to eliminate departure misses and further reduce server load. A framework for lazy replication is presented and evaluated in this article. In this framework, two predictors are plugged in to create the working replication algorithm. With these two simple predictors, lazy replication can decrease server load by 15&percnt; from MVC with only a minor increase in network traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25321","fieldValue":"ACM"}
