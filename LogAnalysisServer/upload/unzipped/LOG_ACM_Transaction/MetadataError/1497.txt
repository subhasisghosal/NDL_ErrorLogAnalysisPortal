The key problem in creating a PVT is that although only a portion of the scene has been imaged at any given time, the output must simultaneously portray motion throughout the scene. Like previous work in video textures, our method employs min-cut optimization to select fragments of video that can be stitched together both spatially and temporally. However, it differs from earlier work in that the optimization must take place over a much larger set of data. Thus, to create PVTs, we introduce a dynamic programming step, followed by a novel hierarchical min-cut optimization algorithm. We also use gradient-domain compositing to further smooth boundaries between video fragments. We demonstrate our results with an interactive viewer in which users can interactively pan and zoom on high-resolution PVTs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15563","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15563","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15564","fieldValue":" Flash images are known to suffer from several problems: saturation of nearby objects, poor illumination of distant objects, reflections of objects strongly lit by the flash and strong highlights due to the reflection of flash itself by glossy surfaces. We propose to use a flash and no-flash (ambient) image pair to produce better flash images. We present a novel gradient projection scheme based on a gradient coherence model that allows removal of reflections and highlights from flash images. We also present a brightness-ratio based algorithm that allows us to compensate for the falloff in the flash image brightness due to depth. In several practical scenarios, the quality of flash\/no-flash images may be limited in terms of dynamic range. In such cases, we advocate using several images taken under different flash intensities and exposures. We analyze the flash intensity-exposure space and propose a method for adaptively sampling this space so as to minimize the number of captured images for any given scene. We present several experimental results that demonstrate the ability of our algorithms to produce improved flash images."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15564","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15564","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15565","fieldValue":" High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is an area of increasing importance, but most display devices still have limited dynamic range (LDR). Various techniques have been proposed for compressing the dynamic range while retaining important visual information. Multi-scale image processing techniques, which are widely used for many image processing tasks, have a reputation of causing halo artifacts when used for range compression. However, we demonstrate that they can work when properly implemented. We use a symmetrical analysis-synthesis filter bank, and apply local gain control to the subbands. We also show that the technique can be adapted for the related problem of \"companding\", in which an HDR image is converted to an LDR image, and later expanded back to high dynamic range."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15565","fieldValue":"ACM"}
