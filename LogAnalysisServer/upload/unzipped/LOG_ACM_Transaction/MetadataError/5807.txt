This article describes and evaluates a novel method for modeling and synthesizing ASL animations based on samples of ASL signs collected from native signers. We apply this technique to ASL inflecting verbs, common signs in which the location and orientation of the hands is influenced by the arrangement of locations in 3D space that represent entities under discussion. We train mathematical models of hand movement on animation data of signs produced by a native signer. In evaluation studies with native ASL signers, the verb animations synthesized from our model had similar subjective-rating and comprehension-question scores to animations produced by a human animator; they also achieved higher scores than baseline animations. Further, we examine a split modeling technique for accommodating certain verb signs with complex movement patterns, and we conduct an analysis of how robust our modeling techniques are to reductions in the size of their training data. The modeling techniques in this article are applicable to other types of ASL signs and to other sign languages used internationally. Our modelsâ\u20AC™ parameterization of sign animations can increase the repertoire of generation systems and can partially automate the work of humans using sign language scripting systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1453","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1453","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5320","fieldValue":" Advances in biomedical sensors and mobile communication technologies have fostered the rapid growth of mobile health (mHealth) applications in the past years. Users generate a high volume of biomedical data during health monitoring, which can be used by the mHealth server for training predictive models for disease diagnosis and treatment. However, the biomedical sensing data raise serious privacy concerns because they reveal sensitive information such as health status and lifestyles of the sensed subjects. This paper proposes and experimentally studies a scheme that keeps the training samples private while enabling accurate construction of predictive models. We specifically consider logistic regression models which are widely used for predicting dichotomous outcomes in healthcare, and decompose the logistic regression problem into small subproblems over two types of distributed sensing data, i.e., horizontally partitioned data and vertically partitioned data. The subproblems are solved using individual private data, and thus mHealth users can keep their private data locally and only upload (encrypted) intermediate results to the mHealth server for model training. Experimental results based on real datasets show that our scheme is highly efficient and scalable to a large number of mHealth users."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5320","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5320","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}
