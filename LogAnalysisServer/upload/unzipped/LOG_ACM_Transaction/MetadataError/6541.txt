Most of the proposed solutions are centered around supervised, machine learning approaches and review-oriented datasets. In this article, we focus on the more common informal textual communication on the Web, such as online discussions, tweets and social network comments and propose an intuitive, less domain-specific, unsupervised, lexicon-based approach that estimates the level of emotional intensity contained in text in order to make a prediction. Our approach can be applied to, and is tested in, two different but complementary contexts: subjectivity detection and polarity classification. Extensive experiments were carried on three real-world datasets, extracted from online social Web sites and annotated by human evaluators, against state-of-the-art supervised approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, even though unsupervised, outperforms machine learning solutions in the majority of cases, overall presenting a very robust and reliable solution for sentiment analysis of informal communication on the Web."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7431","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7431","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7432","fieldValue":"Duvall, Scott L"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7432","fieldValue":" Automatic clustering of Web pages helps a number of information retrieval tasks, such as improving user interfaces, collection clustering, introducing diversity in search results, etc. Typically, Web page clustering algorithms use only features extracted from the page-text. However, the advent of social-bookmarking Web sites, such as StumbleUpon.com and Delicious.com, has led to a huge amount of user-generated content such as the social tag information that is associated with the Web pages. In this article, we present a subspace based feature extraction approach that leverages the social tag information to complement the page-contents of a Web page for extracting beter features, with the goal of improved clustering performance. In our approach, we consider page-text and tags as two separate views of the data, and learn a shared subspace that maximizes the correlation between the two views. Any clustering algorithm can then be applied in this subspace. We then present an extension that allows our approach to be applicable even if the Web page corpus is only partially tagged, that is, when the social tags are present for not all, but only for a small number of Web pages. We compare our subspace based approach with a number of baselines that use tag information in various other ways, and show that the subspace based approach leads to improved performance on the Web page clustering task. We also discuss some possible future work including an active learning extension that can help in choosing which Web pages to get tags for, if we only can get the social tags for only a small number of Web pages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7432","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7432","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7433","fieldValue":" This article studies information retrieval tasks related to Web comments. Prerequisite of such a study and a main contribution of the article is a unifying survey of the research field. We identify the most important retrieval tasks related to comments, namely filtering, ranking, and summarization. Within these tasks, we distinguish two paradigms according to which comments are utilized and which we designate as comment-targeting and comment-exploiting. Within the first paradigm, the comments themselves form the retrieval targets. Within the second paradigm, the commented items form the retrieval targets (i.e., comments are used as an additional information source to improve the retrieval performance for the commented items). We report on four case studies to demonstrate the exploration of the commentsphere under information retrieval aspects: comment filtering, comment ranking, comment summarization and cross-media retrieval. The first three studies deal primarily with comment-targeting retrieval, while the last one deals with comment-exploiting retrieval. Throughout the article, connections to information retrieval research are pointed out."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7433","fieldValue":"ACM"}
