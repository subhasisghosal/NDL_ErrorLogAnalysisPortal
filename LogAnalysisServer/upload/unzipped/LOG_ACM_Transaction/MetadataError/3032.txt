{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2922","fieldValue":" The large numbers of Chinese calligraphic scripts in existence are valuable part of the Chinese cultural heritage. However, due to the shape complexity of these characters, it is hard to employ existing techniques to effectively retrieve and efficiently index them. In this article, using a novel shape-similarity- based retrieval method in which shapes of calligraphic characters are represented by their contour points extracted from the character images, we propose an interactive partial-distance-map(PDM)- based high-dimensional indexing scheme which is designed specifically to speed up the retrieval performance of the large Chinese calligraphic character databases effectively. Specifically, we use the approximate minimal bounding sphere of a query character and utilize users' relevance feedback to refine the query gradually. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to testify the efficiency and effectiveness of this method. In addition, a new k-NN search called Pseudo k-NN (Pk-NN) search is presented to better facilitate the PDM-based character retrieval."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2922","fieldValue":"Pseudo <i>k<\/i>-NN"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2922","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2922","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20079","fieldValue":" Consider a pipelined machine that can issue instructions every machine cycle. Sometimes, an instruction that uses the result of the instruction preceding it in a pipe must be delayed to ensure that a program computes a right value. We assume that issuing of such instructions is delayed by at most one machine cycle. For such a machine model, given an unbounded number of machine registers and memory locations, an algorithm to find a shortest schedule of the given expression is presented and analyzed. The proposed algorithm is a modification of Coffman-Graham's algorithm [7], which provides an optimal solution to the problem of scheduling tasks on two parallel processors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20079","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20079","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20080","fieldValue":"Steensgaard-Madsen, J."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20080","fieldValue":" A systematic representation of objects grouped into types by constructions similar to the composition of sets in mathematics is proposed. The representation is by lambda expressions, which supports the representation of objects from function spaces. The representation is related to a rather conventional language of type descriptions in a way that is believed to be new.
