Up to now, all existing stability criteria for equilibrium points of the kind of considered GRNs are in the form of the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In this paper, the Brouwer's fixed point theorem is employed to obtain sufficient conditions such that the kind of GRNs under consideration here has at least one nonnegative equilibrium point. Then, by using the nonsingular M-matrix theory and the functional differential equation theory, M-matrix-based sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee that the kind of GRNs under consideration here has a unique nonnegative equilibrium point which is globally asymptotically stable. The M-matrix-based sufficient conditions derived here are to check whether a constant matrix is a nonsingular M-matrix, which can be easily verified, as there are many equivalent statements on the nonsingular M-matrices. So, in terms of computational complexity, the M-matrix-based stability criteria established in this paper are superior to the LMI-based ones in literature. To illustrate the effectiveness of the approach proposed in this paper, several numerical examples and their simulations are given."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5294","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5294","fieldValue":"Globally asymptotic stability analysis for genetic regulatory networks with mixed delays: an m-matrix-based approach"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5294","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5294","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5295","fieldValue":" Human Serum Albumin (HSA) has been suggested to be an alternate biomarker to the existing Hemoglobin-A1c (HbA1c) marker for glycemic monitoring. Development and usage of HSA as an alternate biomarker requires the identification of glycation sites, or equivalently, glucose-binding pockets. In this work, we combine molecular dynamics simulations of HSA and the state-of-art machine learning method Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict glucose-binding pockets in HSA. SVM uses the three dimensional arrangement of atoms and their chemical properties to predict glucose-binding ability of a pocket. Feature selection reveals that the arrangement of atoms and their chemical properties within the first 4A from the centroid of the pocket play an important role in the binding of glucose. With a 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 84 percent, our SVM model reveals seven new potential glucose-binding sites in HSA of which two are exposed only during the dynamics of HSA. The predictions are further corroborated using docking studies. These findings can complement studies directed towards the development of HSA as an alternate biomarker for glycemic monitoring."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5295","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
