The method assigns a score to an arbitrary subset of genes from multiple genomes to assess the orthologous relationships between genes in the subset. This score is computed using sequence similarities between the member genes and the phylogenetic relationship between the corresponding genomes. An ortholog cluster is found as the subset with the highest score, so ortholog clustering is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. The algorithm for finding an ortholog cluster runs in time O(|E|+|V| log|V|), where V and E are the sets of vertices and edges, respectively, in the graph. However, if we discretize the similarity scores into a constant number of bins, the runtime improves to O(|E|+|V|). The proposed method was applied to seven complete eukaryote genomes on which the manually curated database of eukaryotic ortholog clusters, KOG, is constructed. A comparison of our results with the manually curated ortholog clusters shows that our clusters are well correlated with the existing clusters."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4268","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4268","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4268","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4269","fieldValue":" Cryo-EM has become an increasingly powerful technique for elucidating the structure, dynamics, and function of large flexible macromolecule assemblies that cannot be determined at atomic resolution. However, due to the relatively low resolution of cryo-EM data, a major challenge is to identify components of complexes appearing in cryo-EM maps. Here, we describe EMatch, a novel integrated approach for recognizing structural homologues of protein domains present in a 6-10 Ã\u2026 resolution cryo-EM map and constructing a quasi-atomic structural model of their assembly. The method is highly efficient and has been successfully validated on various simulated data. The strength of the method is demonstrated by a domain assembly of an experimental cryo-EM map of native GroEL at 6 Ã\u2026 resolution."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4269","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4269","fieldValue":"Structural bioinformatics, intermediate resolution cryo-EM maps, 3D alignment of secondary structures, macromolecular assemblies, cyclic symmetry."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4269","fieldValue":"EMatch: Discovery of High Resolution Structural Homologues of Protein Domains in Intermediate Resolution Cryo-EM Maps"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4269","fieldValue":"ACM"}
