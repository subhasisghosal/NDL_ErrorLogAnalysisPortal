Owing to content control and other issues, some video-on-demand systems attempt to prevent downloading and peer-to-peer content delivery. Instead, such systems rely on server replication, such as via third-party content distribution networks, to support video streaming (or pseudostreaming) to their clients. A major issue with such systems is the cost of the required server resources. By synchronizing the video streams for clients that make closely spaced requests for the same video from the same server, server costs (such as for retrieval of the video data from disk) can be amortized over multiple requests. A fundamental trade-off then arises, however, with respect to server selection. Network delivery cost is minimized by selecting the nearest server, while server cost is minimized by directing closely spaced requests for the same video to a common server. This article compares classes of server selection policies within the context of a simple system model. We conclude that: (i) server selection using dynamic system state information (rather than only proximities and average loads) can yield large improvements in performance, (ii) deferring server selection for a request as late as possible (i.e., until just before streaming is to begin) can yield additional large improvements, and (iii) within the class of policies using dynamic state information and deferred selection, policies using only â\u20ACœlocalâ\u20AC? (rather than global) request information are able to achieve most of the potential performance gains."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25355","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25355","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25356","fieldValue":" The article addresses the problem of copyright protection for 3D motion-captured data by designing a robust blind watermarking mechanism. The mechanism segments motion capture data and identifies clusters of 3D points per segment. A watermark can be embedded and extracted within these clusters by using a proposed extension of 3D quantization index modulation. The watermarking scheme is blind in nature and the encoded watermarks are shown to be imperceptible, and secure. The resulting hiding capacity has bounds based on cluster size. The watermarks are shown to be robust against attacks such as uniform affine transformations (scaling, rotation, and translation), cropping, reordering, and noise addition. The time complexity for watermark embedding and extraction is estimated as O(n log n) and $O(n^2$ log n), respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25356","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25356","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25357","fieldValue":" Considerable research has been done on the content-based multimedia delivery and access in distributed data repositories. As noted in the literature, there is always a trade-off between multimedia quality and access speed. In addition, the overall performance is greatly determined by the distribution of the multimedia data. In this article, an unsupervised multimedia semantic integration approach for a distributed infrastructure, the Distributed Semantic Indexing (DSI), is presented that addresses both the data quality and search performance. With the ability of summarizing content information and guiding data distribution, the proposed approach is distinguished by: (1) logic-based representation and concise abstraction of the semantic contents of multimedia data, which are further integrated to form a general overview of a multimedia data repositoryâ\u20AC\u201Dcontent signature; (2) application of linguistic relationships to construct a hierarchical metadata based on the content signatures allowing imprecise queries; and (3) achieving the optimal performance in terms of search cost. The fundamental structure of the proposed model is presented. The proposed scheme has been simulated and the simulation results are analyzed and compared against several other approaches that have been advocated in the literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25357","fieldValue":"ACM"}
