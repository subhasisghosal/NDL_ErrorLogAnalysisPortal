The objective of this work is to measure and classify psychophysiological reactivity in response to cultural heritage material presented as visual and audio. We present a data processing and classification framework for the classification of interest. Two studies are reported, adopting a subject-dependent approach to classify psychophysiological signals using mobile physiological sensors and the support vector machine learning algorithm. The results show that it is possible to reliably infer a state of interest from cultural heritage material using psychophysiological feature data and a machine learning approach, informing future work for the development of a real-time physiological computing system for use within an adaptive cultural heritage experience designed to adapt the provision of information to sustain the interest of the visitor."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5883","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5883","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5884","fieldValue":"Treacy Solovey, Erin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5884","fieldValue":"Peck, Evan M"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5884","fieldValue":"Hincks, Samuel W"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5884","fieldValue":"Jacob, Robert J K"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5884","fieldValue":" A growing body of recent work has shown the feasibility of brain and body sensors as input to interactive systems. However, the interaction techniques and design decisions for their effective use are not well defined. We present a conceptual framework for considering implicit input from the brain, along with design principles and patterns we have developed from our work. We also describe a series of controlled, offline studies that lay the foundation for our work with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging, as well as our real-time platform that serves as a testbed for exploring brain-based adaptive interaction techniques. Finally, we present case studies illustrating the principles and patterns for effective use of brain data in human--computer interaction. We focus on signals coming from the brain, but these principles apply broadly to other sensor data and in domains such as aviation, education, medicine, driving, and anything involving multitasking or varying cognitive workload."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5884","fieldValue":"Designing Implicit Interfaces for Physiological Computing: Guidelines and Lessons Learned Using fNIRS"}
