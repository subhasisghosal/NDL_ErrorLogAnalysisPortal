{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1942","fieldValue":" Emerging non-volatile memory technologies such as MRAM are promising design solutions for energy-efficient memory architecture, especially for mobile systems. However, building commodity MRAM by reusing DRAM designs is not straightforward. The existing memory interfaces are incompatible with MRAM small page size, and they fail to leverage MRAM unique properties, causing unnecessary performance and energy overhead. In this article, we propose four techniques to enable and optimize an LPDDRx-compatible MRAM solution: ComboAS to solve the pin incompatibility; DynLat to avoid unnecessary access latencies; and EarlyPA and BufW to further improve performance by exploiting the MRAM unique features of non-destructive read and independent write path. Combining all these techniques together, we boost the MRAM performance by 17&percnt; and provide a DRAM-compatible MRAM solution consuming 21&percnt; less energy."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1942","fieldValue":"MRAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1942","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1942","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10362","fieldValue":" Interdomain routing stitches the disparate parts of the Internet together, making protocol stability a critical issue to both researchers and practitioners. Yet, researchers create safety proofs and counterexamples by hand and build simulators and prototypes to explore protocol dynamics. Similarly, network operators analyze their router configurations manually or using homegrown tools. In this paper, we present a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and implementing routing policies, ranging from high-level guidelines to specific router configurations. Our Formally Safe Routing (FSR) toolkit performs all of these functions from the same algebraic representation of routing policy. We show that routing algebra has a natural translation to both integer constraints (to perform safety analysis with SMT solvers) and declarative programs (to generate distributed implementations). Our extensive experiments with realistic topologies and policies show how FSR can detect problems in an autonomous system's (AS's) iBGP configuration, prove sufficient conditions for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) safety, and empirically evaluate convergence time."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10362","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10363","fieldValue":" Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks remain a major security problem, the mitigation of which is very hard especially when it comes to highly distributed botnet-based attacks. The early discovery of these attacks, although challenging, is necessary to protect end-users as well as the expensive network infrastructure resources. In this paper, we address the problem of DDoS attacks and present the theoretical foundation, architecture, and algorithms of FireCol. The core of FireCol is composed of intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) located at the Internet service providers (ISPs) level. The IPSs form virtual protection rings around the hosts to defend and collaborate by exchanging selected traffic information. The evaluation of FireCol using extensive simulations and a real dataset is presented, showing FireCol effectiveness and low overhead, as well as its support for incremental deployment in real networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10363","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
