{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11014","fieldValue":" On-demand video streaming is becoming a killer application for wireless networks. Recent information-theoretic results have shown that a combination of caching on the users' devices and device-to-device D2D communications yields throughput scalability for very dense networks, which represent critical bottlenecks for conventional cellular and wireless local area network WLAN technologies. In this paper, we consider the implementation of such caching D2D systems where each device pre-caches a subset of video files from a library, and users requesting a file that is not already in their library obtain it from neighboring devices through D2D communication. We develop centralized and distributed algorithms for the delivery phase, encompassing a link scheduling and a streaming component. The centralized scheduling is based on the max-weighted independent set MWIS principle and uses message-passing to determine max-weight independent sets. The distributed scheduling is based on a variant of the FlashLinQ link scheduling algorithm, enhanced by introducing video-streaming specific weights. In both cases, the streaming component is based on a quality-aware stochastic optimization approach, reminiscent of current Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP DASH technology, for which users sequentially request video â\u20ACœchunksâ\u20AC? by choosing adaptively their quality level. The streaming and the scheduling components are coupled by the length of the users' request queues. Through extensive system simulation, the proposed approaches are shown to provide sizeable gains with respect to baseline schemes formed by the concatenation of off-the-shelf FlashLinQ with proportional fair link scheduling and DASH at the application layer."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11014","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11015","fieldValue":" In the context of the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol PTP, estimating the delay's bias is a problem that appears in both one-way using transparent devices or two-way message exchange mechanisms. For estimating the offset via the two-way message exchange mechanism, it is usually assumed that the expected value of delays in forward and reverse directions are equal. However, this is not a realistic assumption for packet-based wide area networks, where delays in down-link and up-link directions may have a significant difference. In this work, we propose a solution to estimate the random delay's bias and improve the synchronization accuracy of IEEE 1588. Our method is easy to implement and is compatible with the current version of the protocol. We compared our results to no bias correction and the Boot-strap method. In addition to the improvement in synchronization accuracy, our method allows us to update the slave clock recursively. The proposed method works well even in the presence of large frequency offsets and can also be implemented by using different filters."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11015","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada (Hajikhani, Mohammad Javad; Kunz, Thomas; Schwartz, Howard); Dept. of Syst. &amp; Comput.
