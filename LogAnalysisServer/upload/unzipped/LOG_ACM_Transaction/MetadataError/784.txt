During this time, clock synthesis tools and algorithms have strove to address a myriad of important issues helping designers to create faster, more reliable, and more power efficient chips. This work provides a complete discussion of the high-performance ASIC clock distribution using information gathered from both leading industrial clock designers and previous research publications. While many techniques are only briefly explained, the references summarize the most influential papers on a variety of topics for more in-depth investigation. This article also provides a thorough discussion of current issues in clock synthesis and concludes with insight into future research and design challenges for the community at large."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/13325","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442087.2442102\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13325","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13325","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13326","fieldValue":" We present the core elements of BonnRoute: advanced data structures and algorithms for fast and high-quality routing in modern technologies. Global routing is based on a combinatorial approximation scheme for min-max resource sharing. Detailed routing uses exact shortest path algorithms, based on a shape-based data structure for pin access and a two-level track-based data structure for long-distance connections. All algorithms are very fast. Compared to an industrial router (on 32 nm and 22 nm chips), BonnRoute is over two times faster, has 5 &percnt; less netlength, 20 &percnt; less vias, and reduces detours by more than 90 &percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/13326","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442087.2442103\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13327","fieldValue":" We address the problem of optimizing fault tolerance in FPGA architectures with high defect rates (such as nano-FPGAs) without significantly degrading performance. Our methods address fault tolerance during the placement and reconfiguration stages of FPGA programming. First, we provide several complexity results for both the fault reconfiguration and fault-tolerance placement problems. Then, we propose a placement algorithm which, in the presence of randomly generated faults, optimizes spare placement to maximize the probability that the FPGA can be reconfigured to meet a specified timing constraint. We also give heuristics for reconfiguration after faults have been detected. Despite the hardness results for both the placement and reconfiguration problems, we show our heuristics perform well in simulation (in one scenario, increasing the probability of successful reconfiguration by as much as 55&percnt; compared to a uniform spare placement)."}
