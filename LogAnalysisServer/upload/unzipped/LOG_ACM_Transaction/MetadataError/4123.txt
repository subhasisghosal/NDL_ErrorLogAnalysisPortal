We present a novel approach for enabling domain experts to model and deploy such processes from their respective domain as Web service compositions. The approach builds on user-editable service, naming and representing Web services as forms. On this basis, the approach provides a visual composition language with a targeted restriction of control-flow expressivity, process simulation, automated process verification mechanisms, and code generation for executing orchestrations. A Web-based service composition prototype implements this approach, including a WS-BPEL code generator. A small lab user study with 14 participants showed promising results for the usability of the system, even for nontechnical domain experts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23283","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23283","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23284","fieldValue":"Cambazoglu, B Barla"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23284","fieldValue":"Ulusoy, zgr"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23284","fieldValue":" Web search engines are known to cache the results of previously issued queries. The stored results typically contain the document summaries and some data that is used to construct the final search result page returned to the user. An alternative strategy is to store in the cache only the result document IDs, which take much less space, allowing results of more queries to be cached. These two strategies lead to an interesting trade-off between the hit rate and the average query response latency. In this work, in order to exploit this trade-off, we propose a hybrid result caching strategy where a dynamic result cache is split into two sections: an HTML cache and a docID cache. Moreover, using a realistic cost model, we evaluate the performance of different result prefetching strategies for the proposed hybrid cache and the baseline HTML-only cache. Finally, we propose a machine learning approach to predict singleton queries, which occur only once in the query stream. We show that when the proposed hybrid result caching strategy is coupled with the singleton query predictor, the hit rate is further improved."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23285","fieldValue":" With the rapid growth of applications which generate timestamped sequences (click streams, GPS trajectories, RFID sequences), sequence anonymization has become an important problem, in that should such data be published or shared. Existing trajectory anonymization techniques disregard the importance of time or the sensitivity of events. This article is the first, to our knowledge, thorough study on time-stamped event sequence anonymization. We propose a novel and tunable generalization framework tailored to event sequences. We generalize time stamps using time intervals and events using a taxonomy which models the domain semantics. We consider two scenarios: (i) sharing the data with a single receiver (the SSR setting), where the receiverâ\u20AC™s background knowledge is confined to a set of time stamps and time generalization suffices, and (ii) sharing the data with colluding receivers (the SCR setting), where time generalization should be combined with event generalization. For both cases, we propose appropriate anonymization methods that prevent both user identification and event prediction. To achieve computational efficiency and scalability, we propose optimization techniques for both cases using a utility-based index, compact summaries, fast to compute bounds for utility, and a novel taxonomy-aware distance function. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach compared with state of the art, in terms of information loss, range query distortion, and preserving temporal causality patterns. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate efficiency and scalability on large-scale real and synthetic datasets."}
