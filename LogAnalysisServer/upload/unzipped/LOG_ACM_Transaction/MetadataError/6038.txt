It is oftentimes harder to guarantee truthfulness when solving a problem than it is to solve the problem itself. Even worse, truthfulness can be utterly destroyed by small uncertainties in a mechanismâ\u20AC™s outcome. One obstacle is that truthful payments depend on outcomes other than the one realized, such as the lengths of non-shortest-paths in a shortest-path auction. Single-call mechanisms are a powerful tool that circumvents this obstacle: they implicitly charge truthful payments, guaranteeing truthfulness in expectation using only the outcome realized by the mechanism. The cost of such truthfulness is a trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments. We study two of the most general domains for truthful mechanisms and largely settle when and to what extent single-call mechanisms are possible. The first single-call construction was discovered by Babaioff et al. [2010] in single-parameter domains. They give a transformation that turns any monotone, single-parameter allocation rule into a truthful-in-expectation single-call mechanism. Our first result is a natural complement to Babaioff et al. [2010]: we give a new transformation that produces a single-call VCG mechanism from any allocation rule for which VCG payments are truthful. Second, in both the single-parameter and VCG settings, we precisely characterize the possible transformations, showing that a wide variety of transformations are possible but that all take a very simple form. Finally, we study the inherent trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments. We show that our construction and that of Babaioff et al. [2010] simultaneously optimize a variety of metrics in their respective domains. Our study is motivated by settings where uncertainty in a mechanism renders other known techniques untruthful, and we offer a variety of examples where such uncertainty can arise. In particular, we analyze pay-per-click advertising auctions, where the truthfulness of the standard VCG-based auction is easily broken when the auctioneerâ\u20AC™s estimated click-through-rates are imprecise."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6033","fieldValue":" Web publishers must balance two objectives: how to keep users engaged by directing them to relevant content, and how to properly monetize this user traffic. The standard approach is to solve each problem in isolation, for example, by displaying content that is tailored to the userâ\u20AC™s interests so as to maximize clickthrough rates (CTR), and also by building a standalone ad serving system that displays ads depending on the userâ\u20AC™s characteristics, the article being viewed by the user, and advertiser-specified constraints. However, showing the user only those articles with highest expected CTR precludes the display of some ads; if the publisher had previously guaranteed the delivery of a certain volume of impressions to such ads, then underdelivery penalties might have to be paid. We propose a joint optimization of article selection and ad serving that minimizes underdelivery by shaping some of the incoming traffic to pages where underperforming ads can be displayed, while incurring only minor drops in CTR. In addition to formulating the problem, we design an online optimization algorithm that can find the optimal traffic shaping probabilities for each new user using only a cache of one number per ad contract. Experiments on a large real-world ad-serving Web portal demonstrate significant advantages over the standalone approach: a threefold reduction in underdelivery with only 10% drop in CTR, or a 2.6-fold reduction with a 4% CTR drop, and similar results over a wide range."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6034","fieldValue":"McAfee, R Preston"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6034","fieldValue":" Modern online advertising increasingly relies on the ability to follow the same user across the Internet using technology called cookie matching to increase efficiency in ad allocation. Web publishers today use this technology to share information about the websites a user has visited, making it possible to target advertisements to users based on their prior history. This begs the question: do publishers (who are competitors for advertising money) always have the incentive to share online information? Intuitive arguments as well as anecdotal evidence suggest that sometimes a premium publisher might suffer information sharing through an effect called information leakage: by sharing user information with the advertiser, the advertiser will be able to target the same user elsewhere on cheaper publishers, leading to a dilution of the value of the supply on the premium publishers. The goal of this article is to explore this aspect of online information sharing. We show that, when advertisers are homogeneous in the sense that their relative valuations of users are consistent, publishers always agree about the benefits of cookie matching in equilibrium: either all publishersâ\u20AC™ revenues benefit, or all suffer, from cookie matching. We also show using a simple model that, when advertisers are not homogeneous, the information leakage indeed can occur, with cookie matching helping one publisherâ\u20AC™s revenues while harming the other."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6034","fieldValue":"ACM"}
