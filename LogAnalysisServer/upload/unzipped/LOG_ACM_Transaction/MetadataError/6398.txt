We propose an opportunistic transmission and fair resource allocation framework, including joint application-layer and physical-layer transmission and optimization. First, we use a parallel subchannels structure by concatenating the Fountain codes and diversity-embedded space-time block codes to provide reliable and flexible transmission in heterogeneous circumstances. Second, we exploit the quality of heterogeneous user experience (quality of experience) metric under D2D video multicast systems, with consideration of various channel states, device capability, video content urgency, and the number of demanding users. Third, we formulate reliable multiple video streams broadcasting to heterogeneous devices as an aggregate maximum utility achieving problem, and we use opportunistic scheduling to select suitable users in each transmission interval to improve the broadcasting utility. Fourth, we use the utility fair scheme to guide rate allocation among multicontent video multicast. Extensive performance comparison and analysis are presented to demonstrate efficiency of the proposed solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7006","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7006","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7007","fieldValue":" The new development of embedded systems has the potential to revolutionize our lives and will have a significant impact on future Internet of Thing (IoT) systems if required services can be automatically discovered and accessed at runtime in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication networks. It is a crucial task for devices to perform timely service discovery in a dynamic environment of IoTs. In this article, we propose a Socioecological Service Discovery (SESD) model for advanced service discovery in M2M communication networks. In the SESD network, each device can perform advanced service search to dynamically resolve complex enquires and autonomously support and co-operate with each other to quickly discover and self-configure any services available in M2M communication networks to deliver a real-time capability. The proposed model has been systematically evaluated and simulated in a dynamic M2M environment. The experiment results show that SESD can self-adapt and self-organize themselves in real time to generate higher flexibility and adaptability and achieve a better performance than the existing methods in terms of the number of discovered service and a better efficiency in terms of the number of discovered services per message."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7008","fieldValue":" Machine-to-Machine communication (M2M) is nowadays increasingly becoming a world-wide network of interconnected devices uniquely addressable, via standard communication protocols. The prevalence of M2M is bound to generate a massive volume of heterogeneous, multisource, dynamic, and sparse data, which leads a system towards major computational challenges, such as, analysis, aggregation, and storage. Moreover, a critical problem arises to extract the useful information in an efficient manner from the massive volume of data. Hence, to govern an adequate quality of the analysis, diverse and capacious data needs to be aggregated and fused. Therefore, it is imperative to enhance the computational efficiency for fusing and analyzing the massive volume of data. Therefore, to address these issues, this article proposes an efficient, multidimensional, big data analytical architecture based on the fusion model. The basic concept implicates the division of magnitudes (attributes), i.e., big datasets with complex magnitudes can be altered into smaller data subsets using five levels of the fusion model that can be easily processed by the Hadoop Processing Server, resulting in formalizing the problem of feature extraction applications using earth observatory system, social networking, or networking applications. Moreover, a four-layered network architecture is also proposed that fulfills the basic requirements of the analytical architecture. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithms used in the fusion model are implemented on Hadoop single-node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS core i5 machine with 3.2GHz processor and 4GB memory. The results show that the proposed system architecture efficiently extracts various features (such as land and sea) from the massive volume of satellite data."}
