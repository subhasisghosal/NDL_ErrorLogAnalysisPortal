After the analysis of an incoming query, a query-specific hardware processing unit is generated on the fly and loaded on the FPGA for immediate query execution. For each query, a specialized hardware accelerator pipeline is composed and configured on the FPGA from a set of presynthesized hardware modules. These partially reconfigurable hardware modules are gathered in a library covering all major SQL operations like restrictions and aggregations, as well as more complex operations such as joins and sorts. Moreover, this holistic query processing approach in hardware supports different data processing strategies including row- as column-wise data processing in order to optimize data communication and processing. This article gives an overview of the proposed query processing methodology and the corresponding library of modules. Additionally, a performance analysis is introduced that is able to estimate the processing time of a query for different processing strategies and different communication and processing architecture configurations. With the help of this performance analysis, architectural bottlenecks may be exposed and future optimized architectures, besides the two prototypes presented here, may be determined."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/21945","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: IBM Deutschland Research & Development GmbH, B&#246;blingen, Germany (Schrfeld, Ute; Vogt, Jrg-Stephan; Weber, Helmut); Friedrich-Alexander-Universit&#228;t Erlangen-N&#252;rnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany (Ziener, Daniel; Bauer, Florian; Becher, Andreas; Dennl, Christopher; Meyer-Wegener, Klaus; Teich, Jrgen)"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21945","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21946","fieldValue":" In this work, we present PolyBlaze, a scalable and configurable multicore platform for FPGA-based embedded systems and systems research. PolyBlaze is an extension of the MicroBlaze soft processor, leveraging the configurability of the MicroBlaze and bringing it into the multicore era with Linux Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP) support. This work details the hardware modifications required for the MicroBlaze processor and its software stack to enable fully validated SMP operations, including atomic operation support, shared interrupts and timers, and exception handling. New in this work, we present a scalable and flexible memory hierarchy optimized for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which manages atomic operations and provides support for future flexible memory hierarchies and heterogeneous systems. Also new is an in-depth analysis of key performance characteristics, including memory bandwidth, latency, and resource usage. For all system configurations, bandwidth is found to scale linearly with the addition of processor cores until the memory interface is saturated. Additionally, average memory latency remains constant until the memory interface is saturated; after which, it scales linearly with each additional processor core."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21946","fieldValue":"ACM"}
