However, the description and parallelization of applications with a time dependent functional behavior has not been considered in NLPs. In such a description, semantic information about time dependent behavior must be made available for the compiler, such that an optimized time independent implementation can be generated automatically. This article introduces language constructs with temporal semantics to NLPs. Using these language constructs, time dependent applications can be specified and a corresponding data-driven implementation can be generated for use on a multi-core system. Despite that these time-aware language constructs can be data-dependent, the application remains functionally deterministic. Pipelining is exploited to increase the throughput of an application. The media access control (MAC) protocol of an IEEE 802.11p WLAN transceiver is used to illustrate the relevance and applicability of the introduced concepts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6631","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6631","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6632","fieldValue":" This article proposes a lifetime aware buffer assignment method for streaming applications like multimedia specified in a synchronous dataflow (SDF) graph on a DRAM\/PRAM hybrid memory in which the endurance of PRAM is limited. We determine whether buffers are assigned to DRAM or PRAM to minimize the writing frequency of PRAM. To solve the problems, we formulate them using Answer Set Programming. Experimental results show that the proposed approach increases the PRAM lifetime by 63&percnt; compared with no optimization, and shows the tradeoff between PRAM and DRAM size to guarantee a lifetime constraint."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6632","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6632","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6633","fieldValue":"Chung, Yi-Fan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6633","fieldValue":"Lo, Yin-Tsung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6633","fieldValue":"King, Chung-Ta"}
