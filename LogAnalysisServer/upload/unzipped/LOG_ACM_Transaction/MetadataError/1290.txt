Under this definition, it is shown that algebraic blending surfaces (surfaces that smoothly join two or more surfaces) have a very specific form. In particular, any polynomial whose zero set blends the zero sets of several other polynomials is always expressible as a simple combination of these polynomials. Using this result, new methods for blending several algebraic surfaces simultaneously are derived."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15015","fieldValue":" To date, methods that blend solids, that is, B-rep or CSG models, with implicit functions require successive composition of the blending functions to handle an arbitrary solid model. The shape of the resulting surfaces depends upon the algebraic distances defined by these functions. To achieve meaningful shapes, previous methods have relied on blending functions that have a pseudo-Euclidean distance measure. These methods are abstracted, resulting in some general observations. Unfortunately, the functions used can exhibit unwanted discontinuities. A new method, the displacement form of blending, embeds the zero surface of the blending functions in a form for which algebraic distance is C1 continuous in the entire domain of definition.Characteristics of the displacement form are demonstrated using the superelliptic blending functions. Intuitive and mathematical underpinnings are provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15016","fieldValue":" A method is proposed for computing an implicit approximant at a point to a parametric curve or surface. The method works for both polynomially and rationally parameterized curves and surfaces and achieves an order of contact that can be prescribed. In the case of nonsingular curve points, the approximant must be irreducible, but in the surface case additional safeguards are incorporated into the algorithm to ensure irreducibility. The method also yields meaningful results at most singularities. In principle, the method is capable of exact implicitization and has a theoretical relationship with certain resultant-based elimination methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15016","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15016","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15017","fieldValue":" For an irreducible algebraic space curve C that is implicitly defined as the intersection of two algebraic surfaces, f (x, y, z) = 0 and g (x, y, z) = 0, there always exists a birational correspondence between the points of C and the points of an irreducible plane curve P, whose genus is the same as that of C. Thus C is rational if the genus of P is zero. Given an irreducible space curve C = (f âˆ© g), with f and g not tangent along C, we present a method of obtaining a projected irreducible plane curve P together with birational maps between the points of P and C. Together with [4], this method yields an algorithm to compute the genus of C, and if the genus is zero, the rational parametric equations for C. As a biproduct, this method also yields the implicit and parametric equations of a rational surface S containing the space curve C.The birational mappings of implicitly defined space curves find numerous applications in geometric modeling and computer graphics since they provide an efficient way of manipulating curves in space by processing curves in the plane. Additionally, having rational surfaces containing C yields a simple way of generating related families of rational space curves."}
