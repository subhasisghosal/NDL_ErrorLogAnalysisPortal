Due to its decentralized and self-organizing nature, P2P malware is harder to detect and block, especially if it utilizes specialized techniques for hiding. We analyze a number of hiding strategies through extensive and realistic simulations over a model of the AS-level Internet topology. We show that the most effective strategy to avoid detection is to drastically reduce the maximal number of peers a node communicates with. While overlay networks of a small constant maximal degree are generally considered to be unscalable, we argue that it is possible to design them to be scalable, efficient, and robust. An important implication is that stealth mode P2P malware that is very difficult to discover with state-of-the-art methods is a plausible threat. We discuss algorithms and theoretical results that support the scalability of stealth mode overlays, and we present realistic event-based simulations of a proof-of-concept system. Besides the context of P2P malware, some of our results are of general interest in the area of constant degree overlays in connection with the problem of how to maintain reasonable performance and reliability with the smallest degree possible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1222","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1222","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3024","fieldValue":" We propose a named entity (NE) recognition method in which word chunks are repeatedly decomposed and concatenated. Our method identifies word chunks with a base chunker, such as a noun phrase chunker, and then recognizes NEs from the recognized word chunk sequences. By using word chunks, we can obtain features that cannot be obtained in word-sequence-based recognition methods, such as the first word of a word chunk, the last word of a word chunk, and so on. However, each word chunk may include a part of an NE or multiple NEs. To solve this problem, we use the following operators: SHIFT for separating the first word from a word chunk, POP for separating the last word from a word chunk, JOIN for concatenating two word chunks, and REDUCE for assigning an NE label to a word chunk. We evaluate our method on a Japanese NE recognition dataset that includes about 200,000 annotations of 191 types of NEs from over 8,500 news articles. The experimental results show that the training and processing speeds of our method are faster than those of a linear-chain structured perceptron and a semi-Markov perceptron, while maintaining high accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21235","fieldValue":" The ability to efficiently aggregate informationâ\u20AC\u201Dfor example compute the average temperatureâ\u20AC\u201Din large networks is crucial for the successful employment of sensor networks. This article addresses the problem of designing truly scalable protocols for computing aggregates in the presence of faults, protocols that can enable million node sensor networks to work efficiently. More precisely, we make four distinct contributions. First, we introduce a simple fault model and analyze the behavior of two existing protocols under the fault model: tree aggregation and gossip aggregation. Second, since the behavior of the two protocols depends on the size of the network and probability of failure, we introduce a hybrid approach that can leverage the strengths of the two protocols and minimize the weaknesses; the new protocol is analyzed under the same fault model. Third, we propose methodology for determining the optimal mix between the two basic protocols; the methodology consists in formulating an optimization problem, using models of the protocol behavior, and solving it. Fourth, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the hybrid protocol and show that it usually performs better, sometimes orders of magnitude better, than both the tree and gossip aggregation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21235","fieldValue":"ACM"}
