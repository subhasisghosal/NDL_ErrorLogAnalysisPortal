While disjoint path protection can effectively deal with isolated single link failures, recovering from multiple failures is not guaranteed. In particular, events such as natural disasters or intentional attacks can lead to multiple correlated failures, for which recovery mechanisms are not well understood. We take a probabilistic view of network failures where multiple failure events can occur simultaneously, and develop algorithms for finding diverse routes with minimum joint failure probability. Moreover, we develop a novel Probabilistic Shared Risk Link Group (PSRLG) framework for modeling correlated failures. In this context, we formulate the problem of finding two paths with minimum joint failure probability as an integer nonlinear program (INLP) and develop approximations and linear relaxations that can find nearly optimal solutions in most cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10104","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10104","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10104","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10105","fieldValue":" In this paper, we define and address a new problem that arises when a base station in a broadband wireless network wishes to multicast information to a large group of nodes and to guarantee some level of reliability using Application-layer forward error correction (FEC) codes. Every data block to be multicast is translated into a sequence of K + n packets, from which every receiver must receive at least K in order to correctly decode the block. The new problem is to determine which PHY-layer modulation and coding scheme (MCS) the base station should use for each packet. We present several variants of this problem, which differ in the number of automatic repeat request (ARQ) rounds during which the delivery of a data block must be completed. Most of these variants are shown to be NP-hard. However, we present optimal solutions for practical instances, where the number of MCSs is small, and efficient approximations and heuristics for the general case of each variant."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10105","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10105","fieldValue":"FEC\/ARQ"}
