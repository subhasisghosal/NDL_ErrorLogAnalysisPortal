The Web-based nature of this information makes it ideal for use in a variety of intelligent systems that can take advantage of the users' social and personal data. For those systems to be effective, however, it is important to understand the relationship between social and personal preferences. In this work we investigate features of profile similarity and how those relate to the way users determine trust. Through a controlled study, we isolate several profile features beyond overall similarity that affect how much subjects trust hypothetical users. We then use data from FilmTrust, a real social network where users rate movies, and show that the profile features discovered in the experiment allow us to more accurately predict trust than when using only overall similarity. In this article, we present these experimental results and discuss the potential implications for using trust in user interfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23199","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23199","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23200","fieldValue":" With fast-paced growth of digital data and exploding storage management costs, enterprises are looking for new ways to effectively manage their data. One such cost-effective paradigm is the cloud storage model also referred to as Storage-as-a-Service, in which enterprises outsource their storage to a storage service provider (SSP) by storing data (usually encrypted) at a remote SSP-managed site and accessing it over a high speed network. Along with storage capacity used, the SSP often charges clients on the amount of data that is accessed from the SSP site. Thus, it is in the interest of the client enterprise to download only relevant content. This makes search over outsourced storage an important capability. Searching over encrypted outsourced storage, however, is a complex challenge. Each enterprise has different access privileges for different users and this access control needs to be preserved during search (for example, ensuring that a user cannot search through data that is inaccessible from the filesystem due to its permissions). Secondly, the search mechanism has to preserve confidentiality from the SSP and indices can not be stored in plain text. In this article, we present a new filesystem search technique that integrates access control and indexing\/search mechanisms into a unified framework to support access control aware search. Our approach performs indexing within the trusted enterprise domain and uses a novel access control barrel (ACB) primitive to encapsulate access control within these indices. The indices are then systematically encrypted and shipped to the SSP for hosting. Unlike existing enterprise search techniques, our approach is resilient to various common attacks that leak private information. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, our approach is a first such technique that allows search indices to be hosted at the SSP site, thus effectively providing search-as-a-service. This does not require the client enterprise to fully trust the SSP for data confidentiality. We describe the architecture and implementation of our approach and a detailed experimental analysis comparing with other approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23200","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23200","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23201","fieldValue":" This article uses data from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us to empirically examine the dynamics of collaborative tagging systems and to study how coherent categorization schemes emerge from unsupervised tagging by individual users. First, we study the formation of stable distributions in tagging systems, seen as an implicit form of â\u20ACœconsensusâ\u20AC? reached by the users of the system around the tags that best describe a resource. We show that final tag frequencies for most resources converge to power law distributions and we propose an empirical method to examine the dynamics of the convergence process, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. The convergence analysis is performed for both the most utilized tags at the top of tag distributions and the so-called long tail. Second, we study the information structures that emerge from collaborative tagging, namely tag correlation (or folksonomy) graphs. We show how community-based network techniques can be used to extract simple tag vocabularies from the tag correlation graphs by partitioning them into subsets of related tags. Furthermore, we also show, for a specialized domain, that shared vocabularies produced by collaborative tagging are richer than the vocabularies which can be extracted from large-scale query logs provided by a major search engine. Although the empirical analysis presented in this article is based on a set of tagging data obtained from del.icio.us, the methods developed are general, and the conclusions should be applicable across other websites that employ tagging."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23202","fieldValue":"Ma, Wei-Ying"}
