In this articles, we introduce a context-aware semi-local detector (CASL) framework to give a systematic answer with three contributions: (1) We integrate the context of interest points to recurrently refine their detections. (2) This integration boosts interest point detectors from the traditionally local scale to a semi-local scale to discover more discriminative salient regions. (3) Such context-aware structure further enables us to bring forward category learning (usually in the subsequent recognition phase) into interest point detection to locate category-aware, meaningful salient regions. Our CASL detector consists of two phases. The first phase accumulates multiscale spatial correlations of local features into a difference of contextual Gaussians (DoCG) field. DoCG quantizes detector context to highlight contextually salient regions at a semi-local scale, which also reveals visual attentions to a certain extent. The second phase locates contextual peaks by mean shift search over the DoCG field, which subsequently integrates contextual cues into feature description. This phase enables us to integrate category learning into mean shift search kernels. This learning-based CASL mechanism produces more category-aware features, which substantially benefits the subsequent visual categorization process. We conducted experiments in image search, object characterization, and feature detector repeatability evaluations, which reported superior discriminability and comparable repeatability to state-of-the-art works."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1674","fieldValue":" Extended subwords and the matrix register file (MRF) are two micro architectural techniques that address some of the limitations of existing SIMD architectures. Extended subwords are wider than the data stored in memory. Specifically, for every byte of data stored in memory, there are four extra bits in the media register file. This avoids the need for data-type conversion instructions. The MRF is a register file organization that provides both conventional row-wise, as well as column-wise, access to the register file. In other words, it allows to view the register file as a matrix in which corresponding subwords in different registers corresponds to a column of the matrix. It was introduced to accelerate matrix transposition which is a very common operation in multimedia applications. In this paper, we show that the MRF is very versatile, since it can also be used for other permutations than matrix transposition. Specifically, it is shown how it can be used to provide efficient access to strided data, as is needed in, e.g., color space conversion. Furthermore, it is shown that special-purpose instructions (SPIs), such as the sum-of-absolute differences (SAD) instruction, have limited usefulness when extended subwords and a few general SIMD instructions that we propose are supported, for the following reasons. First, when extended subwords are supported, the SAD instruction provides only a relatively small performance improvement. Second, the SAD instruction processes 8-bit subwords only, which is not sufficient for quarter-pixel resolution nor for cost functions used in image and video retrieval. Results obtained by extending the SimpleScalar toolset show that the proposed techniques provide a speedup of up to 3.00 over the MMX architecture. The results also show that using, at most, 13 extra media registers yields an additional performance improvement ranging from 1.38 to 1.57."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1674","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1674","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7410","fieldValue":"Del Bimbo, Alberto"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7410","fieldValue":" Among different approaches for 3D face recognition, solutions based on local facial characteristics are very promising, mainly because they can manage facial expression variations by assigning different weights to different parts of the face. However, so far, a few works have investigated the individual relevance that local features play in 3D face recognition with very simple solutions applied in the practice. In this article, a local approach to 3D face recognition is combined with a feature selection model to study the relative relevance of different regions of the face for the purpose of discriminating between different subjects. The proposed solution is experimented using facial scans of the Face Recognition Grand Challenge dataset. Results of the experimentation are two-fold: they quantitatively demonstrate the assumption that different regions of the face have different relevance for face discrimination and also show that the relevance of facial regions changes for different ethnic groups."}
