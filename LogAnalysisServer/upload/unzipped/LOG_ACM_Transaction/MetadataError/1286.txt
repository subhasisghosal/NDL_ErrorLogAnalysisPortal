For any fixed &epsis;, the counter achieves a relative error of Î\u201D with high probability, at the cost of O(((1\/Î\u201D) log $n)^O(1\/&epsis;)) register operations per increment and O(n4\/5+&epsis;((1\/Î\u201D) log n)O(1\/&epsis;)$) register operations per read. The counter combines randomized sampling for estimating large values with an expander for estimating small values. This is the first counter implementation that is sublinear the number of processes and works despite a strong adversary scheduler that can observe internal states of processes. An application of the improved counter is an improved protocol for solving randomized shared-memory consensus, which reduces the best previously known individual work complexity from O(n log n) to an optimal O(n), resolving one of the last remaining open problems concerning consensus in this model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15006","fieldValue":" Goodman (Properties of Beta-splines. J. Approx. Theory 44, 2 (June 1985), 132-153) gave an explicit formula for cubic Beta-splines on a uniform knot sequence with varying Î²1 and Î²2 values at the knots. We establish an alternative explicit formula for cubic Beta-splines on a nonuniform knot sequence with constant Î²1 = 1 and varying Î²2 values at the knots. This alternative formula can also be used if the knot sequence contains multiple knots, and is useful for knot insertion. We show how to efficiently evaluate a cubic Beta-spline curve at many values using this formula. We introduce rational cubic Beta-spline curves and surfaces that have extra weight parameters for shape control, and show that they satisfy the same geometric continuity conditions and properties as nonrational cubic Beta-spline curves and surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15006","fieldValue":"ACM"}
