This class of graphs (which we call \"unicyclic networksâ\u20AC?) also has some attractive combinatorial properties, which we present. We characterize when a set of binary phylogenetic trees is displayed by a unicyclic network in terms of tree rearrangement operations. This leads to a triple-wise compatibility theorem and a simple, fast algorithm to determine 1{\\hbox{-}}{\\rm cycle} compatibility. We also use generating function techniques to provide closed-form expressions that enumerate unicyclic networks with specified or unspecified cycle length, and we provide an extension to enumerate a class of multicyclic networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4230","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4231","fieldValue":" Maximum likelihood is one of the most widely used techniques to infer evolutionary histories.
