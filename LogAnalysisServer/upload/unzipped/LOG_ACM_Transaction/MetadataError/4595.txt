The advantage of this property is that a single multiplication is needed to compute the recurrence, so the generator would run faster than the general case. For p = $2^31 âˆ\u2019 1, the most popular modulus used, we provide tables of specific parameter values yielding maximum period for recurrence of order k = 102 and 120.
