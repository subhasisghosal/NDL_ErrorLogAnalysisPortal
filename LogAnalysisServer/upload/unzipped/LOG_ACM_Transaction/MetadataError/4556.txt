Up to a linear transformation, most of the commonly used random vectors possess orthounimodal densities. To generate a random vector from a given orthounimodal density, several general-purpose algorithms are presented; and an experimental performance evaluation illustrates the potential efficiency increases that can be achieved by these algorithms versus naive rejection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24780","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24780","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24781","fieldValue":" Performance of product-form multiclass queuing networks can be determined from normalization constants. For large models, the evaluation of these performance metrics is not possible because of the required amount of computer resources (either by using normalization constants or by using MVA approaches). Such large models can be evaluated with Monte Carlo summation and integration methods. This article proposes two cluster sampling Monte Carlo techniques to deal with such models. First, for a particular type of network, we propose a variance reduction technique based on antithetic variates. It leads to an improvement of Ross, Tsang and Wang's algorithm which is designed to analyze the same family of models. Second, for a more general class of models, we use a mixture of Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods to improve the estimate with respect to Monte Carlo alone."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24781","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24781","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24782","fieldValue":" We present a new concept for a system network to represent systems that are able to undergo structural change. Change in structure is defined in general terms, and includes the addition and deletion of systems and the modification of the relations among components. The structure of a system network is stored in the network executive. Any change in structure-related information is mapped into modifications in the network structure.Based on these concepts, we derive three new system specifications that provide a shorthand notation to specify classes of dynamic structure systems. These new formalisms are: dynamic structure discrete time system, dynamic structure differential equation specified systems, and dynamic structure discrete event system specification. We demonstrate that these formalisms are closed under coupling, making hierarchical model construction possible. formalisms are described using set theoretic notation and general systems theory concepts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24782","fieldValue":"ACM"}
