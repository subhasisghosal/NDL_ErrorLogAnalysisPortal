However there is little published work to support its popularity. Another form of query-independent evidence, URL-type, has been shown to be beneficial on a home page finding task. We compared the usefulness of these types of evidence on the home page finding task, combined with both content and anchor text baselines. Our experiments made use of five query sets spanning three corpora---one enterprise crawl, and the WT10g and VLC2 Web test collections.We found that, in optimal conditions, all of the query-independent methods studied (in-degree, URL-type, and two variants of PageRank) offered a better than random improvement on a content-only baseline. However, only URL-type offered a better than random improvement on an anchor text baseline. In realistic settings, for either baseline, only URL-type offered consistent gains. In combination with URL-type the anchor text baseline was more useful for finding popular home pages, but URL-type with content was more useful for finding randomly selected home pages. We conclude that a general home page finding system should combine evidence from document content, anchor text, and URL-type classification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23866","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23866","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23867","fieldValue":" The evaluative character of a word is called its semantic orientation. Positive semantic orientation indicates praise (e.g., \"honest\", \"intrepid\") and negative semantic orientation indicates criticism (e.g., \"disturbing\", \"superfluous\"). Semantic orientation varies in both direction (positive or negative) and degree (mild to strong). An automated system for measuring semantic orientation would have application in text classification, text filtering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey responses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). This article introduces a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. Two instances of this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of word association: pointwise mutual information (PMI) and latent semantic analysis (LSA). The method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive (1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words). The method attains an accuracy of 82.8&percnt; on the full test set, but the accuracy rises above 95&percnt; when the algorithm is allowed to abstain from classifying mild words."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23867","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23867","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23868","fieldValue":" Specifying exact query concepts has become increasingly challenging to end-users. This is because many query concepts (e.g., those for looking up a multimedia object) can be hard to articulate, and articulation can be subjective. In this study, we propose a query-concept learner that learns query criteria through an intelligent sampling process. Our concept learner aims to fulfill two primary design objectives: (1) it has to be expressive in order to model most practical query concepts and (2) it must learn a concept quickly and with a small number of labeled data since online users tend to be too impatient to provide much feedback. To fulfill the first goal, we model query concepts in k-CNF, which can express almost all practical query concepts. To fulfill the second design goal, we propose our maximizing expected generalization algorithm (MEGA), which converges to target concepts quickly by its two complementary steps: sample selection and concept refinement. We also propose a divide-and-conquer method that divides the concept-learning task into G subtasks to achieve speedup. We notice that a task must be divided carefully, or search accuracy may suffer. Through analysis and mining results, we observe that organizing image features in a multiresolution manner, and minimizing intragroup feature correlation, can speed up query-concept learning substantially while maintaining high search accuracy. Through examples, analysis, experiments, and a prototype implementation, we show that MEGA converges to query concepts significantly faster than traditional methods."}
