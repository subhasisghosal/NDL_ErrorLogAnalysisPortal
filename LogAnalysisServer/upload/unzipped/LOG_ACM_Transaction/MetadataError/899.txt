This multiuser system gives a relational view of data, supports two high level nonprocedural data sublanguages, and runs as a collection of user processes on top of the UNIX operating system for Digital Equipment Corporation PDP 11\/40, 11\/45, and 11\/70 computers. Emphasis is on the design decisions and tradeoffs related to (1) structuring the system into processes, (2) embedding one command language in a general purpose programming language, (3) the algorithms implemented to process interactions, (4) the access methods implemented, (5) the concurrency and recovery control currently provided, and (6) the data structures used for system catalogs and the role of the database administrator.Also discussed are (1) support for integrity constraints (which is only partly operational), (2) the not yet supported features concerning views and protection, and (3) future plans concerning the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13781","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13781","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2299","fieldValue":" We obtain a new fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining the transitive closure of a directed graph. Our algorithm maintains the transitive closure matrix in a total running time of O(mn &plus; (ins &plus; del) · $n^2), where ins (del) is the number of insert (delete) operations performed. Here n is the number of vertices in the graph and m is the initial number of edges in the graph. Obviously, reachability queries can be answered in constant time. The algorithm uses only O(n2) time which is essentially optimal for maintaining the transitive closure matrix. Our algorithm can also support path queries. If v is reachable from u, the algorithm can produce a path from u to v in time proportional to the length of the path. The best previously known algorithm for the problem is due to Demetrescu and Italiano [2000]. Their algorithm has a total running time of O(n3 &plus; (ins &plus; del) · n2). The query time is also constant. In addition, we also present a simple algorithm for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with a total running time of O(mn &plus; ins · n2$ &plus; del). Our algorithms are obtained by combining some new ideas with techniques of Italiano [1986, 1988], King [1999], King and Thorup [2001] and Frigioni et al. [2001]. We also note that our algorithms are extremely simple and can be easily implemented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13782","fieldValue":" Strategy for processing multivariable queries in the database management system INGRES is considered. The general procedure is to decompose the query into a sequence of one-variable queries by alternating between (a) reduction: breaking off components of the query which are joined to it by a single variable, and (b) tuple substitution: substituting for one of the variables a tuple at a time. Algorithms for reduction and for choosing the variable to be substituted are given. In most cases the latter decision depends on estimation of costs; heuristic procedures for making such estimates are outlined."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13782","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13782","fieldValue":"ACM"}
