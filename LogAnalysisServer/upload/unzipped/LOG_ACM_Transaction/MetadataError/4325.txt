The massive influx of video clips has created an urgent need for video search engines to facilitate retrieving relevant clips. Different from traditional long videos, a video clip is a short video often expressing a moment of significance. Due to the high complexity of video data, efficient video clip search from large databases turns out to be very challenging. We propose a novel video clip representation model called the Bounded Coordinate System (BCS), which is the first single representative capturing the dominating content and contentâ\u20AC\u201Dchanging trends of a video clip. It summarizes a video clip by a coordinate system, where each of its coordinate axes is identified by principal component analysis (PCA) and bounded by the range of data projections along the axis. The similarity measure of BCS considers the operations of translation, rotation, and scaling for coordinate system matching. Particularly, rotation and scaling reflect the difference of content tendencies. Compared with the quadratic time complexity of existing methods, the time complexity of measuring BCS similarity is linear. The compact video representation together with its linear similarity measure makes real-time search from video clip collections feasible. To further improve the retrieval efficiency for large video databases, a two-dimensional transformation method called Bidistance Transformation (BDT) is introduced to utilize a pair of optimal reference points with respect to bidirectional axes in BCS. Our extensive performance study on a large database of more than 30,000 video clips demonstrates that BCS achieves very high search accuracy according to human judgment. This indicates that content tendencies are important in determining the meanings of video clips and confirms that BCS can capture the inherent moment of video clip to some extent that better resembles human perception. In addition, BDT outperforms existing indexing methods greatly. Integration of the BCS model and BDT indexing can achieve real-time search from large video clip databases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23991","fieldValue":"Tan, Kian-Lee"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23991","fieldValue":" Over the past decade, there has been explosive growth in the availability of multimedia data, particularly image, video, and music. Because of this, content-based music retrieval has attracted attention from the multimedia database and information retrieval communities. Content-based music retrieval requires us to be able to automatically identify particular characteristics of music data. One such characteristic, useful in a range of applications, is the identification of the singer in a musical piece. Unfortunately, existing approaches to this problem suffer from either low accuracy or poor scalability. In this article, we propose a novel scheme, called Hybrid Singer Identifier (HSI), for efficient automated singer recognition. HSI uses multiple low-level features extracted from both vocal and nonvocal music segments to enhance the identification process; it achieves this via a hybrid architecture that builds profiles of individual singer characteristics based on statistical mixture models. An extensive experimental study on a large music database demonstrates the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, scalability, and robustness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23992","fieldValue":"ACM"}
