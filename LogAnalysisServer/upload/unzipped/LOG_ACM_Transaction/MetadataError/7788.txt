Hamming graphs (Cartesian products of complete graphs) and dragonflies (two-level direct networks with nodes organized in groups) are some direct topologies proposed for such networks. The original definition of the dragonfly topology is very loose, with several degrees of freedom, such as the inter- and intragroup topology, the specific global connectivity, and the number of parallel links between groups (or trunking level). This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the topological properties of the dragonfly network, providing balancing conditions for network dimensioning, as well as introducing and classifying several alternatives for the global connectivity and trunking level. From a topological study of the network, it is noted that a Hamming graph can be seen as a canonical dragonfly topology with a high level of trunking. Based on this observation and by carefully selecting the global connectivity, the Dimension Order Routing (DOR) mechanism safely used in Hamming graphs is adapted to dragonfly networks with trunking. The resulting routing algorithms approximate the performance of minimal, nonminimal, and adaptive routings typically used in dragonflies but without requiring virtual channels to avoid packet deadlock, thus allowing for lower cost router implementations. This is obtained by properly selecting the link to route between groups based on a graph coloring of network routers. Evaluations show that the proposed mechanisms are competitive with traditional solutions when using the same number of virtual channels and enable for simpler implementations with lower cost. Finally, multilevel dragonflies are discussed, considering how the proposed mechanisms could be adapted to them."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10391","fieldValue":" This paper deals with efficient location-based decision-supporting content distribution to mobile groups. We consider the case where a set of information dissemination devices (IDDs) broadcast a limited amount of location-based information to passing mobile nodes that are moving along well-defined paths. We develop a novel model that captures the main aspects of the problem and define a new optimization problem we call Maximum Benefit Message Assignment Problem (MBMAP). We study several variants of this problem in the case where the IDDs are cooperative and in the case where they are not. We develop new approximation algorithms for these variants and then focus on the practical effects of using them in realistic networking scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10391","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10391","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10391","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10392","fieldValue":" A large number of network applications today allow several users to interact together using the many-to-many service mode. In many-to-many communication, also referred to as group communication, a session consists of a group of users (we refer to them as members), where each member transmits its traffic to all other members in the same group. In this paper, we address the problem of grooming subwavelength many-to-many traffic (e.g., OC-3) into high-bandwidth wavelength channels (e.g., OC-192) in optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks. The cost of an optical WDM network is dominated by the cost of higher-layer electronic ports (i.e., transceivers). A transceiver is needed for each initiation and termination of a lightpath. Therefore, our objective is to minimize the total number of lightpaths established. Unfortunately, the grooming problem even with unicast traffic has been shown to be NP-hard. In this paper, we introduce two novel approximation algorithms for the many-to-many traffic grooming problem. We also consider the routing and wavelength assignment problem with the objective of minimizing the number of wavelengths used. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed algorithms use a number of lightpaths that is very close to that of a derived lower bound. Also, we compare the two algorithms on other important objectives such as the number of logical hops traversed by a traffic stream, total amount of electronic switching at a node, and Min-Max objectives."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10392","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
