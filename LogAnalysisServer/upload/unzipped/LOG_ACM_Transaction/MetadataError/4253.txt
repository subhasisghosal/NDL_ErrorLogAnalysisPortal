In this article, we show that queries formulated on shared views, export schema, and shared â\u20ACœontologiesâ\u20AC? can be mediated in the same way using the Context Interchange framework. The proposed framework provides a logic-based object-oriented formalsim for representing and reasoning about data semantics in disparate systems, and has been validated in a prototype implementation providing mediated data access to both traditional and web-based information sources."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23809","fieldValue":"Lim, Ee-Peng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23809","fieldValue":" The main purpose of a digital library is to facilitate users easy access to enormous amount of globally networked information. Typically, this information includes preexisting public library catalog data, digitized document collections, and other databases. In this article, we describe the distributed query system of a digital library prototype system known as HARP. In the HARP project, we have designed and implemented a distributed query processor and its query front-end to support integrated queries to preexisting public library catalogs and structured databases. This article describes our experiences in the design of an extended Sequel (SQL) query language known as HarpSQL. It also presents the design and implementation of the distributed query system. Our experience in distributed query processor and user interface design and development will be highlighted. We believe that our prototyping effort will provide useful lessons to the development of a complete digital library infrastructure."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23810","fieldValue":" There are numerous problems associated with formulating queries on networked information systems. These include increased data volume and complexity, accompanied by slow network access. This article proposes a new approach to a network query user interfaces that consists of two phases: query preview and query refinement. This new approach is based on the concepts of dynamic queries and query previews, which guides users in rapidly and dynamically eliminating undesired records, reducing the data volume to a manageable size, and refining queries locally before submission over a network. Examples of two applications are given: a Restaurant Finder and a prototype for NASA's Earth Observing Systems Data Information Systems (EOSDIS). Data architecture is discussed, and user feedback is presented."}
