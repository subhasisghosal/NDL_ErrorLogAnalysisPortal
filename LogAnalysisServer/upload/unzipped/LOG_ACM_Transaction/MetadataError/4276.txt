Since regions can overlap, a relevant issue is to estimate the proximity of regions in order to predict the number of objects in the regions' intersection. This paper analyzes the problem using a probabilistic approach and provides a solution that effectively computes the proximity through realistic heuristics that only require small amounts of auxiliary data. An extensive simulation to validate the technique is provided. An application is developed to demonstrate how the proximity measure can be successfully applied to the approximate similarity search. Search speedup is achieved by ignoring data regions whose proximity to the query region is smaller than a user-defined threshold. This idea is implemented in a metric tree environment for the similarity range and \"nearest neighbors\" queries. Several measures of efficiency and effectiveness are applied to evaluate proposed approximate search algorithms on real-life data sets. An analytical model is developed to relate proximity parameters and the quality of search. Improvements of two orders of magnitude are achieved for moderately approximated search results. We demonstrate that the precision of proximity measures can significantly influence the quality of approximated algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23864","fieldValue":" Research has shown that most users' online information searches are suboptimal. Query optimization based on a relevance feedback or genetic algorithm using dynamic query contexts can help casual users search the Internet. These algorithms can draw on implicit user feedback based on the surrounding links and text in a search engine result set to expand user queries with a variable number of keywords in two manners. Positive expansion adds terms to a user's keywords with a Boolean \"and,\" negative expansion adds terms to the user's keywords with a Boolean \"not.\" Each algorithm was examined for three user groups, high, middle, and low achievers, who were classified according to their overall performance. The interactions of users with different levels of expertise with different expansion types or algorithms were evaluated. The genetic algorithm with negative expansion tripled recall and doubled precision for low achievers, but high achievers displayed an opposed trend and seemed to be hindered in this condition. The effect of other conditions was less substantial."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3318","fieldValue":" Many steganographic systems embed hidden messages inside the least significant bit layers of colour natural images. The presence of these messages can be difficult to detect by using statistical steganalysis. However, visual steganalysis by humans may be more successful in natural image discrimination. This study examined whether humans could detect least-significant bit steganography in 15 color natural images from the VisTex database using a controlled same\/different task (N &equals; 58) and a yes\/no task (N &equals; 61). While dâ\u20AC² > 1 was observed for color layers 4--8, layers 1--3 had dâ\u20AC² < 1 in both experiments. Thus, layers 1--3 appear to be highly resistant to visual steganalysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3318","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3318","fieldValue":"ACM"}
