We deal systematically with the issues of constructing and representing the trajectories of moving objects and querying the MOD. We propose to model an uncertain trajectory as a three-dimensional (3D) cylindrical body and we introduce a set of novel but natural spatio-temporal operators which capture the uncertainty and are used to express spatio-temporal range queries. We devise and analyze algorithms for processing the operators and demonstrate that the model incorporates the uncertainty in a manner which enables efficient querying, thus striking a balance between the modeling power and computational efficiency. We address some implementation aspects which we experienced in our DOMINO project, as a part of which the operators that we introduce have been implemented. We also report on some experimental observations of a practical relevance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14328","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14328","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14329","fieldValue":" Modern relational database systems are beginning to support ad hoc queries on mining models. In this article, we explore novel techniques for optimizing queries that contain predicates on the results of application of mining models to relational data. For such queries, we use the internal structure of the mining model to automatically derive traditional database predicates. We present algorithms for deriving such predicates for a large class of popular discrete mining models: decision trees, naive Bayes, clustering and linear support vector machines. Our experiments on Microsoft SQL Server demonstrate that these derived predicates can significantly reduce the cost of evaluating such queries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14329","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14329","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14330","fieldValue":" Continuous queries often require significant run-time state over arbitrary data streams. However, streams may exhibit certain data or arrival patterns, or constraints, that can be detected and exploited to reduce state considerably without compromising correctness. Rather than requiring constraints to be satisfied precisely, which can be unrealistic in a data streams environment, we introduce k-constraints, where k is an adherence parameter specifying how closely a stream adheres to the constraint. (Smaller k's are closer to strict adherence and offer better memory reduction.) We present a query processing architecture, called k-Mon, that detects useful k-constraints automatically and exploits the constraints to reduce run-time state for a wide range of continuous queries. Experimental results showed dramatic state reduction, while only modest computational overhead was incurred for our constraint monitoring and query execution algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14330","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14330","fieldValue":"ACM"}
