{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21174","fieldValue":" Many distributed monitoring applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) require the location information of a sensor node. In this article, we address the problem of enabling nodes of Wireless Sensor Networks to determine their location in an untrusted environment, known as the secure localization problem. We propose a novel range-independent localization algorithm called SeRLoc that is well suited to a resource constrained environment such as a WSN. SeRLoc is a distributed algorithm based on a two-tier network architecture that allows sensors to passively determine their location without interacting with other sensors. We show that SeRLoc is robust against known attacks on a WSNs such as the wormhole attack, the Sybil attack, and compromise of network entities and analytically compute the probability of success for each attack. We also compare the performance of SeRLoc with state-of-the-art range-independent localization schemes and show that SeRLoc has better performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21174","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21174","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21175","fieldValue":" In this article, we define the time-indexing problem as the in-network storage and querying of sensor network data based solely on the time attribute. We argue qualitatively why existing storage schemes may be insufficient as solutions. We then present, analyze, and evaluate novel and lightweight solutions to both the storage and the querying subproblems for time indexing. First, the time-indexed storage problem is formally defined and two formulations are presented seeking to optimize generic utility functions that are derived from concerns about energy, bandwidth usage, and storage balancing. We present and analyze decentralized protocols to solve these formulations and prove the optimality of some of our solutions. Secondly, maintenance and use of simple overlays among rendezvous point nodes in order to enable fault-tolerant and efficient time-indexed queries are discussed. Finally, simulation results are presented to quantify performance characteristics of the protocols, and we find that our proposed scheme has low query overhead that scales with system size and density while exhibiting very good load-balancing and fault-tolerance properties. The use of time-indexed structure is shown to achieve more than double the lifetime of sensor networks compared to existing approaches in some scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21175","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21175","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21176","fieldValue":" We show that the coarse-grained and fine-grained localization problems for ad hoc sensor networks can be posed and solved as a pattern recognition problem using kernel methods from statistical learning theory. This stems from an observation that the kernel function, which is a similarity measure critical to the effectiveness of a kernel-based learning algorithm, can be naturally defined in terms of the matrix of signal strengths received by the sensors. Thus we work in the natural coordinate system provided by the physical devices. This not only allows us to sidestep the difficult ranging procedure required by many existing localization algorithms in the literature, but also enables us to derive a simple and effective localization algorithm. The algorithm is particularly suitable for networks with densely distributed sensors, most of whose locations are unknown. The computations are initially performed at the base sensors, and the computation cost depends only on the number of base sensors. The localization step for each sensor of unknown location is then performed locally in linear time. We present an analysis of the localization error bounds, and provide an evaluation of our algorithm on both simulated and real sensor networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21176","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21176","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21177","fieldValue":"Ldeczi, kos"}
