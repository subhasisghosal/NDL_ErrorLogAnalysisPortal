The key (meta) rule introduces cooperation between proofs, a new concept needed to deal with proofs about synchronization by message passing. CSP's new convention for distributed termination of loops is dealt with. Applications of the method involve correctness proofs for two algorithms, one for distributed partitioning of sets, the other for distributed computation of the greatest common divisor of n numbers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19830","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19830","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19831","fieldValue":" A formal system for proving properties of programs accessing a database is introduced. Proving that a program preserves consistency of the database is one of the possible applications of the system. The formal system is a variant of dynamic logic and incorporates a data definition language (DDL) for describing relational databases and a data manipulation language (DML) whose programs access data in a database. The DDL is a many-sorted first-order language that accounts for data aggregations. The DML features a many-sorted assignment in place of the usual data manipulation statements, in addition to the normal programming language constructs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19831","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19831","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19832","fieldValue":"and Walter L Ruzzo, Michael Harrison"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19832","fieldValue":" A new algorithm for recognizing and parsing arbitrary context-free languages is presented, and several new results are given on the computational complexity of these problems. The new algorithm is of both practical and theoretical interest. It is conceptually simple and allows a variety of efficient implementations, which are worked out in detail. Two versions are given which run in faster than cubic time. Surprisingly close connections between the Cocke-Kasami-Younger and Earley algorithms are established which reveal that the two algorithms are â\u20ACœalmostâ\u20AC? identical."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19832","fieldValue":"ACM"}
