In this article, we propose a novel learning-to-trade algorithm termed CORrelation-driven Nonparametric learning strategy (CORN) for actively trading stocks. CORN effectively exploits statistical relations between stock market windows via a nonparametric learning approach. We evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm extensively on several large historical and latest real stock markets, and show that it can easily beat both the market index and the best stock in the market substantially (without or with small transaction costs), and also surpass a variety of state-of-the-art techniques significantly."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7345","fieldValue":" Social network analysis has gained significant attention in recent years, largely due to the success of online social networking and media-sharing sites, and the consequent availability of a wealth of social network data. In spite of the growing interest, however, there is little understanding of the potential business applications of mining social networks. While there is a large body of research on different problems and methods for social network mining, there is a gap between the techniques developed by the research community and their deployment in real-world applications. Therefore the potential business impact of these techniques is still largely unexplored. In this article we use a business process classification framework to put the research topics in a business context and provide an overview of what we consider key problems and techniques in social network analysis and mining from the perspective of business applications. In particular, we discuss data acquisition and preparation, trust, expertise, community structure, network dynamics, and information propagation. In each case we present a brief overview of the problem, describe state-of-the art approaches, discuss business application examples, and map each of the topics to a business process classification framework. In addition, we provide insights on prospective business applications, challenges, and future research directions. The main contribution of this article is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of current techniques while providing a critical perspective on business applications of social network analysis and mining."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7345","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7345","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7346","fieldValue":" Electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) is growing exponentially with the rapid development of electronic commerce. As a result, consumers are increasingly crowded by a huge amount of eWOM contents and therefore there is a need to automatically recommend eWOM contents that are helpful to them. Existing helpfulness assessment approaches that deterministically estimate the helpfulness of eWOM contents lack a generative formulation and are limited to the training set that has been voted by many readers. This article presents a rigorous probabilistic framework for inferring the â\u20ACœhelpfulnessâ\u20AC? of eWOM contents which can build a â\u20ACœhelpfulnessâ\u20AC? model from a low number of votes on eWOM contents. Furthermore, we introduce a measurement, â\u20ACœhelpfulnessâ\u20AC? bias, as the benchmark for the â\u20ACœhelpfulnessâ\u20AC? of eWOM documents. We also propose a model that exploits the graphical model and expectation maximization algorithm, under this probabilistic framework, to demonstrate the versatility of our framework. Our algorithm is compared experimentally to other existing helpfulness discovering algorithms and the experimental results show that our framework can effectively model the helpfulness of eWOM contents better than other approaches, and therefore indicate the capability of our framework to recommend helpful eWOMs to potential consumers."}
