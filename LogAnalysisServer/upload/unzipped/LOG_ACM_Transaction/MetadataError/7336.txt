It is shown that the two-hop relaying scheme proposed by Grossglauser and Tse (2001), while capable of achieving a per-node throughput of Î˜(1), incurs an expected packet delay of $Î©(logn\/Î±n^2), where Î±n2) is the variance parameter of the Brownian motion model. It is then shown that an attempt to reduce the delay beyond this value results in the throughput dropping to its value under static settings.In particular, it is shown that under a large class of scheduling and relaying schemes, if the mean packet delay is O(nÎ±\/Î±n2$), for any Î± â\u2030¤ 0, then the per-node throughput must be O(1\/âˆšn). This result is in sharp contrast to other results that have recently been reported in the literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9486","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9486","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9486","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9486","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9487","fieldValue":" This correspondence considers the problem of distributed source coding of multiple sources over a network with multiple receivers. Each receiver seeks to reconstruct all of the original sources. The work by Ho et al. 2004 demonstrates that random network coding can solve this problem at the potentially high cost of jointly decoding the source and the network code. Motivated by complexity considerations we consider the performance of separate source and network codes. Previous work by Effros et al. 2003 demonstrates the failure of separation between source and network codes for nonmulticast networks.We demonstrate that failure for multicast networks. We study networks with capacity constraints on edges. It is shown that the problem with two sources and two receivers is always separable. Counterexamples are presented for other cases."}
