In the F-Completion problem, we are given an n-vertex graph G and an integer k as input, and asked whether at most k edges can be added to G so that the resulting graph does not contain a graph from F as an induced subgraph. It was shown recently that two special cases of F-Completion, namely, (i) the problem of completing into a chordal graph known as Minimum Fill-in (SIAM J. Comput. 2013), which corresponds to the case of $F&equals;{C_4, C5, C6, &ldots;}, and (ii) the problem of completing into a split graph (Algorithmica 2015), that is, the case of F&equals;{C4, 2K2, C5}, are solvable in parameterized subexponential time $2O(&surd;k&log;k)n^O(1). The exploration of this phenomenon is the main motivation for our research on F-Completion. In this article, we prove that completions into several well-studied classes of graphs without long induced cycles and paths also admit parameterized subexponential time algorithms by showing that: ‚\u20AC\u201DThe problem Trivially Perfect Completion, which is F-Completion for F&equals;{C4, P4}, a cycle and a path on four vertices, is solvable in parameterized subexponential time 2O(&surd;klogk)nO(1). ‚\u20AC\u201DThe problems known in the literature as Pseudosplit Completion, the case in which F{2K2, C4}, and Threshold Completion, in which F&equals;2K2, P4, C4}, are also solvable in time 2O(&surd;klogk)nO}(1). We complement our algorithms for F-Completion with the following lower bounds: ‚\u20AC\u201DFor F&equals;{2K2}, F&equals; {C4}, F&equals;{Po4}, and F&equals;{2K2, P4}, F-Completion cannot be solved in time 2o(k)nO(1)$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. Our upper and lower bounds provide a complete picture of the subexponential parameterized complexity of F-Completion problems for any F ‚ä\u2020 {2K2, C4, P4$}."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12539","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12539","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12540","fieldValue":" We introduce quantum XOR games, a model of two-player, one-round games that extends the model of XOR games by allowing the referee‚\u20ACôs questions to the players to be quantum states. We give examples showing that quantum XOR games exhibit a wide range of behaviors that are known not to exist for standard XOR games, such as cases in which the use of entanglement leads to an arbitrarily large advantage over the use of no entanglement. By invoking two deep extensions of Grothendieck‚\u20ACôs inequality, we present an efficient algorithm that gives a constant-factor approximation to the best performance that players can obtain in a given game, both in the case that they have no shared entanglement and that they share unlimited entanglement. As a byproduct of the algorithm, we prove some additional interesting properties of quantum XOR games, such as the fact that sharing a maximally entangled state of arbitrary dimension gives only a small advantage over having no entanglement at all."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/12540","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: CNRS, D&#233;partement d&#8217;Informatique, &#201;cole normale sup&#233;rieure, Paris (Regev, Oded); Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Vidick, Thomas)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12540","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12540","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12541","fieldValue":" An input-oblivious proof system is a proof system in which the proof does not depend on the claim being proved. Input-oblivious versions of NP and MA were introduced in passing by Fortnow, Santhanam, and Williams, who also showed that those classes are related to questions on circuit complexity. In this article, we wish to highlight the notion of input-oblivious proof systems and initiate a more systematic study of them. We begin by describing in detail the results of Fortnow et al. and discussing their connection to circuit complexity. We then extend the study to input-oblivious versions of IP, and PCP, and ZK and present few preliminary results regarding those versions."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12541","fieldValue":"BPP"}
