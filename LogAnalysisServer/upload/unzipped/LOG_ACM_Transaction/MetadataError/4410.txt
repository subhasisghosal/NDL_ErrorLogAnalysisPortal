In the U.S., critics have decried P3P as an industry attempt to avoid meaningful privacy legislation, while developers have portrayed the proposal as a tool for helping users make informed decisions about the impact of their Web surfing choices. This dispute touches upon the privacy model underlying P3P, the U.S. political context regarding privacy, and the technical components of the protocol. This article presents an examination of these factors, with an eye towards distilling lessons for developers of future social protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24273","fieldValue":"The platform for privacy preference as a social protocol: An examination within the U.S. policy context"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24273","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24273","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24274","fieldValue":" We study management strategies for main memory database clusters that are interposed between Internet applications and back-end databases as content caches. The task of management is to allocate data across individual cache databases and to route queries to the appropriate databases for execution. The goal is to maximize effective cache capacity and to minimize synchronization cost. We propose an affinity-based management system for main memory database cLUsters (ALBUM). ALBUM executes each query in two stages in order to take advantage of the query affinity that is observed in a wide range of applications. We evaluate the data\/query distribution strategy in ALBUM with a set of trace-based simulations. The results show that ALBUM reduces cache miss ratio by a factor of 1.7 to 9 over alternative strategies. We have implemented a prototype of ALBUM, and compare its performance to that of an existing infrastructure: a fully replicated database with large buffer cache. The results show that ALBUM outperforms the existing infrastructure with the same number of server machines by a factor of 2 to 7, and that ALBUM with only 1\/3 to 1\/2 of the server machines achieves the same throughput as the existing infrastructure."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3353","fieldValue":" The use of illumination and view-dependent texture information is recently the best way to capture the appearance of real-world materials accurately. One example is the Bidirectional Texture Function. The main disadvantage of these data is their massive size. In this article, we employ perceptually-based methods to allow more efficient handling of these data. In the first step, we analyse different uniform resampling by means of a psychophysical study with 11 subjects, comparing original data with rendering of a uniformly resampled version over the hemisphere of illumination and view-dependent textural measurements. We have found that down-sampling in view and illumination azimuthal angles is less apparent than in elevation angles and that illumination directions can be down-sampled more than view directions without loss of visual accuracy. In the second step, we analyzed subjects gaze fixation during the experiment. The gaze analysis confirmed results from the experiment and revealed that subjects were fixating at locations aligned with direction of main gradient in rendered stimuli. As this gradient was mostly aligned with illumination gradient, we conclude that subjects were observing materials mainly in direction of illumination gradient. Our results provide interesting insights in human perception of real materials and show promising consequences for development of more efficient compression and rendering algorithms using these kind of massive data."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3353","fieldValue":"BTF"}
