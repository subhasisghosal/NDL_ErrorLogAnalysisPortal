Unfortunately, rather than benchmarking with realistic file-system images, most system designers and evaluators rely on ad hoc assumptions and (often inaccurate) rules of thumb. Furthermore, the lack of standardization and reproducibility makes file-system benchmarking ineffective. To remedy these problems, we develop Impressions, a framework to generate statistically accurate file-system images with realistic metadata and content. Impressions is flexible, supporting user-specified constraints on various file-system parameters using a number of statistical techniques to generate consistent images. In this article, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Impressions and demonstrate its utility using desktop search as a case study. We believe Impressions will prove to be useful to system developers and users alike."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20986","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20986","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3004","fieldValue":" Japanese sentences have completely different word orders from corresponding English sentences. Typical phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems such as Moses search for the best word permutation within a given distance limit (distortion limit). For English-to-Japanese translation, we need a large distance limit to obtain acceptable translations, and the number of translation candidates is extremely large. Therefore, SMT systems often fail to find acceptable translations within a limited time. To solve this problem, some researchers use rule-based preprocessing approaches, which reorder English words just like Japanese by using dozens of rules. Our idea is based on the following two observations: (1) Japanese is a typical head-final language, and (2) we can detect heads of English sentences by a head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) parser. The main contributions of this article are twofold: First, we demonstrate how off-the-shelf, state-of-the-art HPSG parser enables us to write the reordering rules in an abstract level and can easily improve the quality of English-to-Japanese translation. Second, we also show that syntactic heads achieve better results than semantic heads. The proposed method outperforms the best system of NTCIR-7 PATMT EJ task."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3004","fieldValue":"HPSG"}
