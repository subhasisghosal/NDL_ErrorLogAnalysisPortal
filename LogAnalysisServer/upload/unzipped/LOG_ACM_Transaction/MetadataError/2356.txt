The existing methods, such as the Lloyd algorithm and the quasi-Newton solver, are efficient and easy to implement; however, they compute only the local optimal solutions due to the highly non-linear nature of the CVT energy. This paper presents a novel method, called manifold differential evolution (MDE), for computing globally optimal geodesic CVT energy on triangle meshes. Formulating the mutation operator using discrete geodesics, MDE naturally extends the powerful differential evolution framework from Euclidean spaces to manifold domains. Under mild assumptions, we show that MDE has a provable probabilistic convergence to the global optimum. Experiments on a wide range of 3D models show that MDE consistently out-performs the existing methods by producing results with lower energy. Thanks to its intrinsic and global nature, MDE is insensitive to initialization and mesh tessellation. Moreover, it is able to handle multiply-connected Voronoi cells, which are challenging to the existing geodesic CVT methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17740","fieldValue":"Manifold differential evolution (MDE): a global optimization method for geodesic centroidal voronoi tessellations on meshes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17740","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17740","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17741","fieldValue":"Xin, Shi-Qing"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17741","fieldValue":" This article presents a new method to optimally partition a geometric domain with capacity constraints on the partitioned regions. It is an important problem in many fields, ranging from engineering to economics. It is known that a capacity-constrained partition can be obtained as a power diagram with the squared L2 metric. We present a method with super-linear convergence for computing optimal partition with capacity constraints that outperforms the state-of-the-art in an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in the context of three different applications in computer graphics and geometric processing: displacement interpolation of function distribution, blue-noise point sampling, and optimal convex decomposition of 2D domains. Furthermore, the proposed method is extended to capacity-constrained optimal partition with respect to general cost functions beyond the squared Euclidean distance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17741","fieldValue":"ACM"}
