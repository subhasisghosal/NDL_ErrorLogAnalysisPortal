{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5588","fieldValue":" This article describes a design and implementation of an augmented desk system, named EnhancedDesk, which smoothly integrates paper and digital information on a desk. The system provides users an intelligent environment that automatically retrieves and displays digital information corresponding to the real objects (e.g., books) on the desk by using computer vision. The system also provides users direct manipulation of digital information by using the users' own hands and fingers for more natural and more intuitive interaction. Based on the experiments with our first prototype system, some critical issues on augmented desk systems were identified when trying to pursue rapid and fine recognition of hands and fingers. To overcome these issues, we developed a novel method for realtime finger tracking on an augmented desk system by introducing a infrared camera, pattern matching with normalized correlation, and a pan-tilt camera. We then show an interface prototype on EnhancedDesk. It is an application to a computer-supported learning environment, named Interactive Textbook. The system shows how effective the integration of paper and digital information is and how natural and intuitive direct manipulation of digital information with users' hands and fingers is."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5588","fieldValue":"Integrating paper and digital information on EnhancedDesk: a method for realtime finger tracking on an augmented desk system"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5588","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5588","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5589","fieldValue":" The rapid and accelerating move towards use of mobile technologies has increasingly provided people and organizations with the ability to work away from the office and on the move. The new ways of working afforded by these technologies are often characterized in terms of access to information and people anytime, anywhere. This article presents a study of mobile workers that highlights different facets of access to remote people and information, and different facets of anytime, anywhere. Four key factors in mobile work are identified: the role of planning, working in \"dead time,\" accessing remote technological and informational resources, and monitoring the activities of remote colleagues. By reflecting on these issues, we can better understand the role of technology and artifacts in mobile work and identify the opportunities for the development of appropriate technological solutions to support mobile workers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5589","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5589","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5590","fieldValue":" Real-time collaborative graphics editing systems allow a group of users to view and edit the same graphics document at the same time from geographically dispersed sites connected by communication networks. Consistency maintenance in the face of concurrent accesses to shared objects is one of the core issues in the design of these types of systems. In this article, we propose an object-level multiversioning approach to consistency maintenance in real-time collaborative graphic editors. This approach is novel in achieving intention preservation and convergence, in preserving the work concurrently produced by multiple users in the face of conflict, and in minimizing the number of object versions for conflict resolution. Major technical contributions of this work include a formal specification of a unique combined effect for an arbitrary group of conflict and compatible operations, a distributed algorithm for incremental creation of multiple object versions, a consistent object identification scheme for multiple object versions, and a convergent layering scheme for overlapping objects. All algorithms and schemes presented in this article have been implemented in an Internet-based GRACE (graphics collaborative editing) system."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5590","fieldValue":"GRACE"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5590","fieldValue":"ACM"}
