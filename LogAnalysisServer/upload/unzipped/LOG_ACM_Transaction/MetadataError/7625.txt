{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10059","fieldValue":" Motivated partially by a control-theoretic viewpoint, we propose a game-theoretic model, called random access game, for contention control. We characterize Nash equilibria of random access games, study their dynamics, and propose distributed algorithms (strategy evolutions) to achieve Nash equilibria. This provides a general analytical framework that is capable of modeling a large class of system-wide quality-of-service (QoS) models via the specification of per-node utility functions, in which system-wide fairness or service differentiation can be achieved in a distributed manner as long as each node executes a contention resolution algorithm that is designed to achieve the Nash equilibrium. We thus propose a novel medium access method derived from carrier sense multiple access\/collision avoidance (CSMA\/CA) according to distributed strategy update mechanism achieving the Nash equilibrium of random access game. We present a concrete medium access method that adapts to a continuous contention measure called conditional collision probability, stabilizes the network into a steady state that achieves optimal throughput with targeted fairness (or service differentiation), and can decouple contention control from handling failed transmissions. In addition to guiding medium access control design, the random access game model also provides an analytical framework to understand equilibrium and dynamic properties of different medium access protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10059","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10059","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10059","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10060","fieldValue":" We study the scaling laws for the throughputs and delays of two coexisting wireless networks that operate in the same geographic region. The primary network consists of Poisson distributed legacy users of density n, and the secondary network consists of Poisson distributed cognitive users of density m, with m >n. The primary users have a higher priority to access the spectrum without particular considerations for the secondary users, while the secondary users have to act conservatively in order to limit the interference to the primary users. With a practical assumption that the secondary users only know the locations of the primary transmitters (not the primary receivers), we first show that both networks can achieve the same throughput scaling law as what Gupta and Kumar (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 46, no. 2, pp. 388-404, Mar. 2000) established for a standalone wireless network if proper transmission schemes are deployed, where a certain throughput is achievable for each individual secondary user (i.e., zero outage) with high probability. By using a fluid model, we also show that both networks can achieve the same delay-throughput tradeoff as the optimal one established by El Gamal et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 52, no. 6, pp. 2568-2592, Jun. 2006) for a standalone wireless network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10060","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10060","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10060","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10061","fieldValue":" Network operators need high-capacity router architectures that can offer scalability, provide throughput guarantees, and maintain packet ordering. However, current centralized crossbar-based architectures cannot scale to fast line rates and high port counts. On the other hand, while load-balanced switch architectures that rely on two identical stages of fixed configuration meshes appear to be an effective way to scale Internet routers to very high capacities, they incur a large worst-case packet reordering that is at best quadratic to the switch size. In this paper, we introduce the concurrent matching switch (CMS) architecture, which also uses two identical stages of fixed configuration meshes with the same scalability properties as current load-balanced routers. However, by adopting a novel contention-resolution architecture that is scalable and distributed, the CMS architecture enforces packet ordering throughout the switch. Using the CMS architecture, we show that scalability, 100% throughput, packet ordering, and O(1) amortized time complexity with sequential hardware per linecard can all be achieved. We further demonstrate a delay analysis for the CMS architecture."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10061","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
