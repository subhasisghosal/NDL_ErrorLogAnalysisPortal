Our method is inspired by painting operations and uses methods for statistical example-based synthesis to automate content synthesis and deformation. Our real-time approach takes a form of local inverse procedural modeling based on intermediate statistical models: selected regions of procedurally and manually constructed example scenes are analyzed, and their parameters are stored as distributions in a palette, similar to colors on a painter's palette. These distributions can then be interactively applied with brushes and combined in various ways, like in painting systems. Selected regions can also be moved or stretched while maintaining the consistency of their content. Our method captures both distributions of elements and structured objects, and models their interactions. Results range from the interactive editing of 2D artwork maps to the design of 3D virtual worlds, where constraints set by the terrain's slope are also taken into account."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17354","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: University Grenoble-Alpes, CNRS (LJK), and Inria and Universit&#233; de Montr&#233;al (Emilien, Arnaud); University Grenoble-Alpes, CNRS (LJK), and Inria (Vimont, Ulysse; Cani, Marie-Paule); Purdue University (Benes, Bedrich); Universit&#233; de Montr&#233;al (Poulin, Pierre)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17354","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17354","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17355","fieldValue":" We present the novel grammar language CGA++ for the procedural modeling of architecture. While existing grammar-based approaches can produce stunning results, they are limited in what modeling scenarios can be realized. In particular, many context-sensitive tasks are precluded, not least because within the rules specifying how one shape is refined, the necessary knowledge about other shapes is not available. Transcending such limitations, CGA++ significantly raises the expressiveness and offers a generic and integrated solution for many advanced procedural modeling problems. Pivotally, CGA++ grants first-class citizenship to shapes, enabling, within a grammar, directly accessing shapes and shape trees, operations on multiple shapes, rewriting shape (sub)trees, and spawning new trees (e.g., to explore multiple alternatives). The new linguistic device of events allows coordination across multiple shapes, featuring powerful dynamic grouping and synchronization. Various examples illustrate CGA++, demonstrating solutions to previously infeasible modeling challenges."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17355","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Esri R&#38;D Center Zurich (Schwarz, Michael; Mller, Pascal)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17355","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17355","fieldValue":"ACM"}
