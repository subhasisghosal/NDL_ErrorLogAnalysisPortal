Using a photon-counting technique, we derive expressions for the relativistic transformation of radiance. We show how to incorportate the Doppler and searchlight effects in the two common techniques of special relativistic visualization, namely ray tracing and polygon rendering. Most authors consider geometrical appearance only and neglect relativistic effects on the lighting model. Chang et al. [1996] present an incorrect derivation of the searchlight effect, which we compare to our results. Some examples are given to show the results of image synthesis with relativistic effects taken into account."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15176","fieldValue":"Searchlight and Doppler effects in the visualization of special relativity: a corrected derivation of the transformation of radiance"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15176","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15176","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15177","fieldValue":" Generalized cylinders provide a compact representation for modeling many components of natural objects as well as a great variety of human-made industrial parts. This paper presents a new approach to modeling generalized cylinders based on cross-sectional curves defined using Fourier descriptors. This modeling is based on contour interpolation and is implemented using a subdivision technique. The definition of generalized cylinders uses a three-dimensional trajectory which provides an adequate control for the smoothness of bend with a small number of parameters and includes the orientation of each cross-section (i.e, the local coordinate system) in the interpolation framework. Fourier representations of cross-sectional curves are obtained from contours in digital images, and corresponding points are identified by considering angular and arc-length parametrizations. Changes in cross-section shape through the trajectory are performed using Fourier morphing. The technique proposed provides a comprehensive definition that allows the modeling of a wide variety of shapes, while maintaining a compact characterization to facilitate the description of shapes and displays."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15177","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15177","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15178","fieldValue":" In this paper we give a simple method for drawing a closed rational curve specified in terms of control points as two BÃ©zier segments.
