Although programming languages and tools are evolving to simplify device-level design, programming such systems is still difficult and time-consuming largely due to system-wide challenges involving communication between heterogeneous devices, which currently require ad hoc solutions. Most communication frameworks and APIs which have dominated parallel application development for decades were developed for homogeneous systems, and hence cannot be directly employed for hybrid systems. To solve this problem, this article presents the System Coordination Framework (SCF), which employs message passing to transparently enable communication between tasks described using different programming tools (and languages), and running on heterogeneous processing devices of systems from domains ranging from embedded systems to High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. By hiding low-level architectural details of the underlying communication from an application designer, SCF can improve application development productivity, provide higher levels of application portability, and offer rapid design-space exploration of different task\/device mappings. In addition, SCF enables custom communication synthesis that exploits mechanisms specific to different devices and platforms, which can provide performance improvements over generic solutions employed previously. Our results indicate a performance improvement of 28Ã\u2014 and 682Ã\u2014 by employing FPGA devices for two applications presented in this article, while simultaneously improving the developer productivity by approximately 2.5 to 5 times by using SCF."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21809","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3085","fieldValue":"Costa-Juss, Marta R."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3085","fieldValue":" Two of the most popular Machine Translation (MT) paradigms are rule based (RBMT) and corpus based, which include the statistical systems (SMT). When scarce parallel corpus is available, RBMT becomes particularly attractive. This is the case of the Chinese--Spanish language pair. This article presents the first RBMT system for Chinese to Spanish. We describe a hybrid method for constructing this system taking advantage of available resources such as parallel corpora that are used to extract dictionaries and lexical and structural transfer rules. The final system is freely available online and open source. Although performance lags behind standard SMT systems for an in-domain test set, the results show that the RBMTâ\u20AC™s coverage is competitive and it outperforms the SMT system in an out-of-domain test set. This RBMT system is available to the general public, it can be further enhanced, and it opens up the possibility of creating future hybrid MT systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3085","fieldValue":"Description of the Chinese-to-Spanish Rule-Based Machine Translation System Developed Using a Hybrid Combination of Human Annotation and Statistical Techniques"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3085","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3085","fieldValue":"ACM"}
