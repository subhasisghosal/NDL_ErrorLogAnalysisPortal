Current approaches use simplified assumptions or propose complex analysis algorithms to bound the cache-related preemption delay. In this paper, a scalable preemption delay analysis for associative instruction caches to control the analysis precision and the time-complexity is proposed. An accurate preemption delay calculation is integrated into a cache-aware schedulability analysis. The framework is evaluated in several experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6325","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6325","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6326","fieldValue":" Accurate and fast system modeling is central to the rapid design space exploration needed for embedded-system design. With fast, complex SoCs playing a central role in such systems, system designers have come to require MIPS-range simulation speeds and near-cycle accuracy. The sophisticated simulation frameworks that have been developed for high-speed system performance modeling do not address power consumption, although it is a key design constraint. In this paper, we define a simulation-based methodology for extending system performance-modeling frameworks to also include power modeling. We demonstrate the use of this methodology with a case study of a real, complex embedded system, comprising the Intel XScaleÂ®g embedded microprocessor, its WMMX#8482; SIMD coprocessor, L1 caches, SDRAM and the on-board address and data buses. We describe detailed power models for each of these components and validate them against physical measurements from hardware, demonstrating that such frameworks enable designers to model both power and performance at high speeds without sacrificing accuracy. Our results indicate that the power estimates obtained are accurate within 5&percnt; of physical measurements from hardware, while simulation speeds consistently exceed a million instructions per second (MIPS)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6327","fieldValue":" In this work, we describe a control theoretic approach to dynamic voltage\/frequency scaling (DVFS) in a pipelined MPSoC architecture with soft real-time constraints, aimed at minimizing energy consumption with throughput guarantees. Theoretical analysis and experiments carried out on a cycle-accurate, energy-aware, and multiprocessor simulation platform are provided. We give a dynamic model of the system behavior which allows to synthesize linear and nonlinear feedback control schemes for the run-time adjustment of the core frequencies. We study the characteristics of the proposed techniques in both transient and steady-state conditions. Finally, we compare the proposed feedback approaches and local DVFS policies from an energy consumption viewpoint."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6327","fieldValue":"DVFS"}
