Recently, a number of distributed scheduling algorithms for wireless networks have emerged. Due to their distributed operation, these algorithms can achieve only a fraction of the maximum possible throughput. As an alternative to increasing the throughput fraction by designing new algorithms, we present a novel approach that takes advantage of the inherent multi-radio capability of WMNs. We show that this capability can enable partitioning of the network into subnetworks in which simple distributed scheduling algorithms can achieve 100% throughput. The partitioning is based on the notion of Local Pooling. Using this notion, we characterize topologies in which 100% throughput can be achieved distributedly. These topologies are used in order to develop a number of centralized channel assignment algorithms that are based on a matroid intersection algorithm. These algorithms pre-partition a network in a manner that not only expands the capacity regions of the subnetworks but also allows distributed algorithms to achieve these capacity regions. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms via simulation and show that they significantly increase the distributedly achievable capacity region. We note that while the identified topologies are of general interference graphs, the partitioning algorithms are designed for networks with primary interference constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9788","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9788","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9788","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9789","fieldValue":" This paper solves the joint power control and SIR assignment problem through distributed algorithms in the uplink of multi-cellular wireless networks. The 1993 Foschini-Miljanic distributed power control can attain a given fixed and feasible SIR target. In data networks, however, SIR needs to be jointly optimized with transmit powers in wireless data networks. In the vast research literature since the mid-1990s, solutions to this joint optimization problem are either distributed but suboptimal, or optimal but centralized. For convex formulations of this problem, we report a distributed and optimal algorithm. The main issue that has been the research bottleneck is the complicated, coupled constraint set, and we resolve it through a re-parametrization via the left Perron Frobenius eigenvectors, followed by development of a locally computable ascent direction. A key step is a new characterization of the feasible SIR region in terms of the loads on the base stations, and an indication of the potential interference from mobile stations, which we term spillage. Based on this load-spillage characterization, we first develop a distributed algorithm that can achieve any Pareto-optimal SIR assignment, then a distributed algorithm that picks out a particular Pareto-optimal SIR assignment and the associated powers through utility maximization. Extensions to power-constrained and interference-constrained cases are carried out. The algorithms are theoretically sound and practically implementable: we present convergence and optimality proofs as well as simulations using 3GPP network and path loss models."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9789","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9789","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9789","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9790","fieldValue":" Many multicast overlay networks maintain application-specific performance goals by dynamically adapting the overlay structure when the monitored performance becomes inadequate. This adaptation results in an unstructured overlay where no neighbor selection constraints are imposed. Although such networks provide resilience to benign failures, they are susceptible to attacks conducted by adversaries that compromise overlay nodes. Previous defense solutions proposed to address attacks against overlay networks rely on strong organizational constraints and are not effective for unstructured overlays. In this work, we identify, demonstrate and mitigate insider attacks against measurement-based adaptation mechanisms in unstructured multicast overlay networks. We propose techniques to decrease the number of incorrect adaptations by using outlier detection and limit the impact of malicious nodes by aggregating local information to derive global reputation for each node. We demonstrate the attacks and mitigation techniques through real-life deployments of a mature overlay multicast system."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9790","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
