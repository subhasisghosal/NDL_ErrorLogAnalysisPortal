Aronov et al. [2008] prove that, if one makes certain realistic input assumptions on the terrain, this complexity is Θ(n+m&sqrt;n) in the worst case, where n denotes the number of triangles that define the terrain and m denotes the number of Voronoi sites. We prove that, under a relaxed set of assumptions, the Voronoi diagram has expected complexity O(n+m), given that the sites are sampled uniformly at random from the domain of the terrain (or the surface of the terrain). Furthermore, we present a construction of a terrain that implies a lower bound of $Ω(nm^2\/3$) on the expected worst-case complexity if these assumptions on the terrain are dropped. As an additional result, we show that the expected fatness of a cell in a random planar Voronoi diagram is bounded by a constant."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2711","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2711","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18248","fieldValue":"An Implementation of a Class of Stabilized Explicit Methods for the Time Integration of Parabolic Equations"}
