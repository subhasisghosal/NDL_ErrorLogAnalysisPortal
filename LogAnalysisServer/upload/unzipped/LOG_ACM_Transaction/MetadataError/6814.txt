Here we propose a complementary evaluation model for DSR. Drawing from evolutionary economics, we define a fitness-utility model that better captures the evolutionary nature of design improvements and the essential DSR nature of searching for a satisfactory design across a fitness landscape. Our goal is to move DSR to more meaningful evaluations of design artifacts for sustainable impacts. A key premise of this new thinking is that the evolutionary fitness of a design artifact is more valuable than its immediate usefulness. We conclude with a discussion of the strengths and challenges of the fitness-utility model for the performance of rigorous and relevant DSR."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8186","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8186","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8187","fieldValue":"Holsapple, Clyde W"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8187","fieldValue":" Information technology is inseparable from contemporary knowledge management (KM). Although anecdotal evidence and individual case studies suggest that effective knowledge management initiatives contribute to superior firm performance, other kinds of empirical investigations are scarce, and more to the point, most of them are based on perceptions of survey participants embedded in the firms being studied. Moreover, studies analyzing the question of whether superior KM performance can predict superior market-based valuation appear to be virtually nonexistent. Findings of such studies would be of value to those who champion and direct a firmâ\u20AC™s KM efforts, and to the firmâ\u20AC™s strategists, planners, and operational managers. Here, we empirically examine the relationship between KM performance and firm valuation; the former is assessed by international panels of independent KM experts and the latter is evaluated in terms of market-based measures. Based on data spanning eight years, the results show that superior KM performance has a statistically significant positive association with firm valuation in terms of Tobinâ\u20AC™s q, price-to-book ratio, and price-to-sales ratio. This study contributes to the management literature by using independent expert judges and archival data to substantiate the notion that KM competencies are an important ingredient in a firmâ\u20AC™s performance as indicated by market-based valuation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/8187","fieldValue":"Tobin&rsquo;s q"}
