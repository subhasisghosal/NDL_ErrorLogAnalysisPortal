{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3720","fieldValue":" A method for sound field control applied to active noise control is presented and evaluated. The method uses Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) feedforward control to find a Minimal Mean Square Error (MMSE)-optimal linear sound field controller under a causality constraint. It is obtained by solving a polynomial matrix spectral factorization and a linear (Diophantine) polynomial matrix equation. An important component in the design is the control signal penalty term of the criterion. Its use and influence is here discussed and evaluated using measured room impulse responses. The results indicate that the use of a relatively simple, frequency-weighted penalty on individual control signals provides most of the benefits obtainable by the considered more advanced alternative. We also introduce and illustrate several tools for performance analysis. An analytical expression for the attainable performance clearly reveals the performance loss generated by having to use a causal controller instead of the ideal noncausal controller. This loss is largest at low frequencies. Furthermore, we introduce a measure of the reproducibility of the target noise sound field with given control loudspeaker setups and room transfer functions. It describes how well a controller that uses an input subspace of dimension equal to the effective rank of the system is able to reproduce a target sound field. This performance measure can e.g. be used to support the selection of good combinations of placements of control loudspeakers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3720","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3720","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3721","fieldValue":"Perez-Solano, Juan J."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3721","fieldValue":"Felici-Castell, Santiago"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3721","fieldValue":" Wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) are known for their potential applications in multiple areas, such as audio-based surveillance, binaural hearing aids or advanced acoustic monitoring. The knowledge of the spatial position of a source of interest is usually a requirement for many of these applications. Therefore, source localization is an important problem to be addressed in WASNs. Unfortunately, most localization algorithms need costly signal processing stages that prevent them from being implemented in low-cost sensor networks, requiring additional modules for signal acquisition and processing. This paper presents a low-complexity method for acoustic event detection and localization considering a change detection statistical framework. Two possible implementation approaches based on the efficient cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm are presented and discussed. Results from simulations and a real deployment show that the proposed techniques can be easily implemented in low-cost sensor networks, providing good localization accuracy and making good use of the available node resources."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3721","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3721","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3722","fieldValue":" An important aspect of a humanoid robot is audition. Previous work has presented robot systems capable of sound localization and source segregation based on microphone arrays with various configurations. However, no theoretical framework for the design of these arrays has been presented. In the current paper, a design framework is proposed based on a novel array quality measure. The measure is based on the effective rank of a matrix composed of the generalized head related transfer functions (GHRTFs) that account for microphone positions other than the ears. The measure is shown to be theoretically related to standard array performance measures such as beamforming robustness and DOA estimation accuracy. Then, the measure is applied to produce sample designs of microphone arrays. Their performance is investigated numerically, verifying the advantages of array design based on the proposed theoretical framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3722","fieldValue":"Theoretical framework for the optimization of microphone array configuration for humanoid robot audition"}
