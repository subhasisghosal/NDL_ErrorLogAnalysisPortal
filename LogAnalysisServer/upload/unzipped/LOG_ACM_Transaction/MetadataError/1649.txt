The algorithm allows registering raw noisy data, possibly contaminated with outliers, without pre-filtering or denoising the data. Further, the method significantly reduces the number of trials required to establish a reliable registration between the underlying surfaces in the presence of noise, without any assumptions about starting alignment. Our method is based on a novel technique to extract all coplanar 4-points sets from a 3D point set that are approximately congruent, under rigid transformation, to a given set of coplanar 4-points. This extraction procedure runs in roughly $O(n^2$ + k) time, where n is the number of candidate points and k is the number of reported 4-points sets. In practice, when noise level is low and there is sufficient overlap, using local descriptors the time complexity reduces to O(n + k). We also propose an extension to handle similarity and affine transforms. Our technique achieves an order of magnitude asymptotic acceleration compared to common randomized alignment techniques. We demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm on several sets of multiple range scans with varying degree of noise, outliers, and extent of overlap."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15957","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15957","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15958","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15958","fieldValue":" A semi-automatic approach is presented that enables the generation of a high-quality 3D model of a static object from an image sequence that was taken by a moving, uncalibrated consumer camera. A bounding box is placed around the object, and orthographic projections onto the sides of the bounding box are automatically generated out of the image sequence. These ortho-images can be imported as background maps in the orthographic views (e.g., the top, side, and front view) of any modeling package. Modelers can now use these ortho-images to guide their modeling by tracing the shape of the object over the ortho-images. This greatly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the manual modeling process. An additional advantage over existing semi-automatic systems is that modelers can use the modeling package that they are trained in and can thereby increase their productivity by applying the advanced modeling features the package offers. The results presented show that accurate 3D models can even be generated for translucent or specular surfaces, and the approach is therefore still applicable in cases where today's fully automatic image-based approaches or laser scanners would fail."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2513","fieldValue":"Chin, Francis Y L"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2513","fieldValue":"Ting, Hing-Fung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2513","fieldValue":" The 2D Online Bin Packing is a fundamental problem in Computer Science and the determination of its asymptotic competitive ratio has research attention. In a long series of papers, the lower bound of this ratio has been improved from 1.808, 1.856 to 1.907 and its upper bound reduced from 3.25, 3.0625, 2.8596, 2.7834 to 2.66013. In this article, we rewrite the upper bound record to 2.5545. Our idea for the improvement is as follows. In 2002, Seiden and van Stee [Seiden and van Stee 2003] proposed an elegant algorithm called H ‚ä\u2014 C, comprised of the Harmonic algorithm H and the Improved Harmonic algorithm C, for the two-dimensional online bin packing problem and proved that the algorithm has an asymptotic competitive ratio of at most 2.66013. Since the best known online algorithm for one-dimensional bin packing is the Super Harmonic algorithm [Seiden 2002], a natural question to ask is: could a better upper bound be achieved by using the Super Harmonic algorithm instead of the Improved Harmonic algorithm? However, as mentioned in Seiden and van Stee [2003], the previous analysis framework does not work. In this article, we give a positive answer for this question. A new upper bound of 2.5545 is obtained for 2-dimensional online bin packing. The main idea is to develop new weighting functions for the Super Harmonic algorithm and propose new techniques to bound the total weight in a rectangular bin."}
