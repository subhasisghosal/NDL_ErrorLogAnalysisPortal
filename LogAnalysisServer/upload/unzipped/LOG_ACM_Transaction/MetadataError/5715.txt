Current efforts at quantitative estimation of filament length distribution, architecture and orientation from microscopy images are predominantly limited to visual estimation and indirect experimental inference. Here we demonstrate the application of a new algorithm to reliably estimate centerlines of biological filament bundles and extract individual filaments from the centerlines by systematically disambiguating filament intersections. We utilize a filament enhancement step followed by reverse diffusion based filament localization and an integer programming based set combination to systematically extract accurate filaments automatically from microscopy images. Experiments on simulated and real confocal microscope images of flat cells (2D images) show efficacy of the new method."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5146","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5146","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5146","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5147","fieldValue":" The Local\/Global Alignment (Zemla, 2003), or LGA, is a popular method for the comparison of protein structures. One of the two components of LGA requires us to compute the longest common contiguous segments between two protein structures. That is, given two structures A = (a1; . . . ; an) and B = (b1; . . . ; bn) where ak, bk âˆˆ $R^3, we are to find, among all the segments f = (ai; . . . ; aj) and g = (bi; . . . ; bj) that fulfill a certain criterion regarding their similarity, those of the maximum length. We consider the following criteria: (1) the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between f and g is to be within a given t âˆˆ R; (2) f and g can be superposed such that for each k, i â\u2030¤ k â\u2030¤ j, ||ak - bk|| â\u2030¤ t for a given t âˆˆ R. We give an algorithm of O(n log n + nl) time complexity when the first requirement applies, where l is the maximum length of the segments fulfilling the criterion. We show an FPTAS which, for any Îµ âˆˆ R, finds a segment of length at least l, but of RMSD up to (1 + &epsilon)t, in O(n log n + n\/Îµ) time. We propose an FPTAS which for any given Îµ âˆˆ R, finds all the segments f and g of the maximum length which can be superposed such that for each k, i â\u2030¤ k â\u2030¤ j, ||ak - bk|| â\u2030¤ (1 + &epsilon)t, thus fulfilling the second requirement approximately. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log2 n\/Îµ5$) when consecutive points in A are separated by the same distance (which is the case with protein structures). These worst-case runtime complexities are verified using C++ implementations of the algorithms, which we have made available at http:\/\/alcs.sourceforge.net\/."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5147","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5147","fieldValue":"PTAS"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5147","fieldValue":"RMSD"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5147","fieldValue":"ACM"}
