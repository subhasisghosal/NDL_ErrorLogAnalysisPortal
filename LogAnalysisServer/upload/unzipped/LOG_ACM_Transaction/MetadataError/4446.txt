We studied how the level of detail of auditory and visual stimuli interact in the perception of audio-visual material rendering quality. Our study is based on perception of material discrimination, when varying the levels of detail of modal synthesis for sound, and bidirectional reflectance distribution functions for graphics. We performed an experiment for two different models (a Dragon and a Bunny model) and two material types (plastic and gold). The results show a significant interaction between auditory and visual level of detail in the perception of material similarity, when comparing approximate levels of detail to a high-quality audio-visual reference rendering. We show how this result can contribute to significant savings in computation time in an interactive audio-visual rendering system. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows interaction of audio and graphics representation in a material perception task."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24365","fieldValue":" Search engines continue to struggle to provide everyday users with a service capable of delivering focussed results that are relevant to their information needs. Moreover, traditional search engines really only provide users with a starting point for their information search. That is, upon selecting a page from a search result list, the interaction between user and search engine is effectively over and the user must continue their search alone. In this article, we argue that a comprehensive search service needs to provide the user with more help, both at the result list level and beyond, and we outline some recommendations for intelligent Web search support. We introduce the SearchGuide Web search support system and we describe how it fulfils the requirements for a search support system, providing evaluation results where applicable."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24365","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24365","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24366","fieldValue":" The continuous growth in the size and use of the World Wide Web imposes new methods of design and development of online information services. The need for predicting the users' needs in order to improve the usability and user retention of a Web site is more than evident and can be addressed by personalizing it. Recommendation algorithms aim at proposing â\u20ACœnextâ\u20AC? pages to users based on their current visit and past users' navigational patterns. In the vast majority of related algorithms, however, only the usage data is used to produce recommendations, disregarding the structural properties of the Web graph. Thus importantâ\u20AC\u201Din terms of PageRank authority scoreâ\u20AC\u201Dpages may be underrated. In this work, we present UPR, a PageRank-style algorithm which combines usage data and link analysis techniques for assigning probabilities to Web pages based on their importance in the Web site's navigational graph. We propose the application of a localized version of UPR (l-UPR) to personalized navigational subgraphs for online Web page ranking and recommendation. Moreover, we propose a hybrid probabilistic predictive model based on Markov models and link analysis for assigning prior probabilities in a hybrid probabilistic model. We prove, through experimentation, that this approach results in more objective and representative predictions than the ones produced from the pure usage-based approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24366","fieldValue":"ACM"}
