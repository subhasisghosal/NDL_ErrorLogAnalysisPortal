{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21264","fieldValue":" The diversity of the deployment settings of sensor networks is naturally inherited from the diversity of geographical features of the embedded environment, and greatly influences network design. Many sensor network protocols in the literature implicitly assume that sensor nodes are deployed inside a simple geometric region, without considering possible obstacles and holes in the deployment environment. When the real deployment setting deviates from that, we often observe degraded performance. Thus, it is highly desirable to have a generic approach to handle sensor fields with complex shapes. In this article, we propose a segmentation algorithm that partitions an irregular sensor field into nicely shaped pieces such that algorithms and protocols that assume a nice sensor field can be applied inside each piece. Across the segments, problem dependent structures specify how the segments and data collected in these segments are integrated. Our segmentation algorithm does not require any extra knowledge (e.g., sensor locations) and only uses network connectivity information. This unified spatial-partitioning approach makes the protocol design become flexible and independent of deployment specifics. Existing protocols are still reusable with segmentation, and the development of new topology-adaptive protocols becomes much easier. We verified the correctness of the algorithm on various topologies and evaluated the performance improvements by integrating shape segmentation with several fundamental problems in network design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21264","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21264","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21265","fieldValue":" Information aggregation is an important operation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) executed for the purpose of monitoring and reporting environmental data. Due to the performance constraints of sensor nodes the in-network form of the aggregation is especially attractive since it allows saving expensive resources during frequent network queries. Easy accessibility of networks and nodes and almost no physical protection against corruptions raise high security challenges. Protection against attacks aiming to falsify the aggregated result is considered to be of prime importance. In this article we design the first general framework for secure information aggregation in WSNs focusing on scenarios where aggregation is performed by one of its nodes. The framework achieves security against node corruptions and is based solely on the symmetric cryptographic primitives that are more suitable for WSNs in terms of efficiency. We analyze performance of the framework and unlike many previous approaches increase confidence in it by a rigorous proof of security within the specially designed formal security model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21266","fieldValue":" Limitation on available resources is a major challenge in wireless sensor networks. Due to high rates of unexpected node\/link failures, robust data delivery through multiple hops also becomes a critical issue. In this article we present a state-free gradient-based forwarding (SGF) protocol to address these challenges. Nodes running SGF do not maintain states of neighbors or network topology and thus can scale to very large networks. Without using routing tables, SGF builds a cost field called gradient that provides each node the direction to forward data. The maintenance of gradient is purely driven by data transmissions and hence incurs little overhead. To adapt to transient channel variations and topology changes, the forwarder of a routing node is selected opportunistically among multiple candidate nodes through a distributed contention process. Simulation results show that SGF achieves significant energy savings and outperforms several existing data forwarding protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21267","fieldValue":" Distributed observation and control of mobile objects via static wireless sensors demands timely information in a distance-sensitive manner: Information about closer objects is required more often and more quickly than that of farther objects. In this article, we present a wireless sensor network protocol, Trail, that supports distance-sensitive tracking of mobile objects for in-network subscribers upon demand. Trail achieves a find time that is linear in the distance from a subscriber to an object, via a distributed data structure that is updated only locally when the object moves. Notably, Trail does not partition the network into a hierarchy of clusters and clusterheads, and as a result Trail has lower maintenance costs, is more locally fault tolerant, and it better utilizes the network in terms of load balancing and minimizing the size of the data structure needed for tracking. Moreover, Trail is reliable and energy efficient, despite the network dynamics that are typical of wireless sensor networks. Trail can be refined by tuning certain parameters, thereby yielding a family of protocols that are suited for different application settings such as rate of queries, rate of updates, and network size. We evaluate the performance of Trail by analysis, simulations in a 90 Ã\u2014 90 sensor network, and experiments on 105 Mica2 nodes in the context of a pursuer-evader control application."}
