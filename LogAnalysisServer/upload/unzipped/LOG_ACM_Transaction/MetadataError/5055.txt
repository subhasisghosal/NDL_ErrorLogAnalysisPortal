{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3801","fieldValue":" Due to the difficulty of creating pitch-labeled training data that cover the rich diversity found in music signals, unsupervised feature-based approaches derived from signal processing and feature design remain critical for multipitch estimation (MPE) of polyphonic music. While a large number of feature representations have been proposed in the literature, an effective means of combining different domains of features for MPE is still needed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, referred to as combined frequency and periodicity (CFP), that detects pitches according to the agreement of a harmonic series in the frequency domain and a subharmonic series in the lag (quefrency) domain. This approach nicely aggregates the complementary advantages of the two feature domains in different frequency ranges, and improves the robustness of the pitch detection function to the interference of the overtones of simultaneous pitches. We report a comprehensive evaluation that compares CFP against three state-of-the-art approaches using three MPE datasets and four symphonies. The evaluation is characteristic of the coverage and complexity of music (in terms of instrument type and degree of polyphony). In addition, we also evaluate the performance of the MPE approaches when a number of audio degradations are applied. Results show that the proposed unsupervised method performs consistently well across the types of Western polyphonic music considered, and is robust to audio degradations such as high-pass filtering and MP3 compression."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3801","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3801","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3802","fieldValue":" The harmonic distortion level (HDL), an important criterion used to evaluate loudspeaker performance, can usually be measured using spectral analysis. However, spectral analysis entails great computational complexity. Furthermore, long measurement times are necessary to measure HDL accurately in a noisy environment. Therefore, we proposed the HDL measurement technique for a loudspeaker using an adaptive filter. This measurement technique can measure HDL as accurately as spectral analysis using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Furthermore, its computational complexity is much less than that of spectral analysis. Nevertheless, this measurement technique requires a long measurement time to assess the convergence of filter coefficients. This paper presents a description of the new HDL measurement technique of a loudspeaker using plural adaptive filters. The proposed measurement technique can measure HDL more accurately than spectral analysis in a noisy environment. We evaluated the performance of the proposed measurement technique using computer simulations. Results based on computer simulations show that the proposed measurement technique is more effective than spectral analysis in an acoustic environment with background noise."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3802","fieldValue":"High-precision harmonic distortion level measurement of a loudspeaker using adaptive filters in a noisy environment"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3802","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3802","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3803","fieldValue":"Hon, Tsz-Kin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3803","fieldValue":" We investigate the self-localization problem of an ad-hoc network of randomly distributed and independent devices in an open-space environment with low reverberation but heavy noise (e.g. smartphones recording videos of an outdoor event). Assuming a sufficient number of sound sources, we estimate the distance between a pair of devices from the extreme (minimum and maximum) time difference of arrivals (TDOAs) from the sources to the pair of devices without knowing the time offset. The obtained inter-device distances are then exploited to derive the geometrical configuration of the network. In particular, we propose a robust audio fingerprinting algorithm for noisy recordings and perform landmark matching to construct a histogram of the TDOAs of multiple sources. The extreme TDOAs can be estimated from this histogram. By using audio fingerprinting features, the proposed algorithm works robustly in very noisy environments. Experiments with free-field simulation and open-space recordings prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3803","fieldValue":"ACM"}
