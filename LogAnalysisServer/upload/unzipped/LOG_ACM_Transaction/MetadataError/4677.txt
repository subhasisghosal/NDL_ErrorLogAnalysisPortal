This is done through a piecewise constant change of measure, which is based on a suitably constructed subsolution to an HJB equation. The main task is to change the measure such that the logarithmic asymptotic optimality is achieved. To that end, we find an upper bound on the second moment of the importance sampling estimator that yields optimality. Numerical simulations illustrate the validity of theoretical results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25082","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25082","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3426","fieldValue":"McDonnell, Rachel"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3426","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3426","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25083","fieldValue":" In this article, rare-event simulation for stochastic recurrence equations of the form $Xn&plus;1=An&plus;1Xn&plus;B_n&plus;1, X0=0 is studied, where &lcub;An;nâ\u2030¥ 1&rcub; and &lcub;Bn;nâ\u2030¥ 1&rcub; are independent sequences consisting of independent and identically distributed real-valued random variables. It is assumed that the tail of the distribution of B1 is regularly varying, whereas the distribution of A1 has a suitably light tail. The problem of efficient estimation, via simulation, of quantities such as P&lcub;Xn>b&rcub; and P&lcub;supkâ\u2030¤nXk$ > b&rcub; for large b and n is studied. Importance sampling strategies are investigated that provide unbiased estimators with bounded relative error as b and n tend to infinity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25083","fieldValue":"ACM"}
