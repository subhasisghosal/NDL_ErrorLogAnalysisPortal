We introduce a robust technique for directly parametrizing a genus-zero surface onto a spherical domain. A key ingredient for making such a parametrization practical is the minimization of a stretch-based measure, to reduce scale-distortion and thereby prevent undersampling. Our second contribution is a scheme for sampling the spherical domain using uniformly subdivided polyhedral domains, namely the tetrahedron, octahedron, and cube. We show that these particular semi-regular samplings can be conveniently represented as completely regular 2D grids, i.e. geometry images. Moreover, these images have simple boundary extension rules that aid many processing operations. Applications include geometry remeshing, level-of-detail, morphing, compression, and smooth surface subdivision."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15308","fieldValue":" Good parameterizations are of central importance in many digital geometry processing tasks. Typically the behavior of such processing algorithms is related to the smoothness of the parameterization and how much distortion it contains. Since a parameterization maps a bounded region of the plane to the surface, a parameterization for a surface which is not homeomorphic to a disc must be made up of multiple pieces. We present a novel parameterization algorithm for arbitrary topology surface meshes which computes a globally smooth parameterization with low distortion. We optimize the patch layout subject to criteria such as shape quality and metric distortion, which are used to steer a mesh simplification approach for base complex construction. Global smoothness is achieved through simultaneous relaxation over all patches, with suitable transition functions between patches incorporated into the relaxation procedure. We demonstrate the quality of our parameterizations through numerical evaluation of distortion measures and the excellent rate distortion performance of semi-regular remeshes produced with these parameterizations. The numerical algorithms required to compute the parameterizations are robust and run on the order of minutes even for large meshes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15308","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15308","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2450","fieldValue":" We study a generalization of the k-median problem with respect to an arbitrary dissimilarity measure D. Given a finite set P of size n, our goal is to find a set C of size k such that the sum of errors D(P,C) &equals; $âˆ\u2018_p &in; P minc &in; C$ {D(p,c)} is minimized. The main result in this article can be stated as follows: There exists a (1+&epsis;)-approximation algorithm for the k-median problem with respect to D, if the 1-median problem can be approximated within a factor of (1+&epsis;) by taking a random sample of constant size and solving the 1-median problem on the sample exactly. This algorithm requires time $n2^O$(mklog(mk\/&epsis;)), where m is a constant that depends only on &epsis; and D. Using this characterization, we obtain the first linear time (1+&epsis;)-approximation algorithms for the k-median problem in an arbitrary metric space with bounded doubling dimension, for the Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative entropy), for the Itakura-Saito divergence, for Mahalanobis distances, and for some special cases of Bregman divergences. Moreover, we obtain previously known results for the Euclidean k-median problem and the Euclidean k-means problem in a simplified manner. Our results are based on a new analysis of an algorithm of Kumar et al.
