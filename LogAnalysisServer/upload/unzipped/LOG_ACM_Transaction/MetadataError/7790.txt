The main problem variant addressed here designs a reconfigurable virtual topology that evolves over time to more efficiently utilize network resources (the MH-VTD-R problem). The case of designing a static non-reconfigurable virtual topology that can accommodate the time-varying traffic (the MH-VTD-NR problem) is also considered. The objectives are to minimize: 1) the number of transceivers, which make up for the main network cost; and 2) the frequency of reconfiguration (for MH-VTD-R), which incurs additional overhead and potential service disruption. We formulate this multiobjective problem as an exact mixed integer linear program (MILP). Due to its high complexity, we propose a very efficient heuristic algorithm called Greedy Approach with Reconfiguration Flattening (GARF). GARF not only solves both (non-)reconfigurable problem variants, but it allows for tuning of the relative importance of the two objectives. Exhaustive experiments on real and synthetic traffic and comparison to previous proposals and bounds reveal the merits of GARF with respect to both solution quality and execution time. Furthermore, the obtained results indicate that the maximal transceiver cost savings achieved by the fully reconfigurable case may not be enough to justify the associated increase in reconfiguration cost. However, results show that an advantageous tradeoff between transceiver cost savings and reconfiguration cost can be achieved by a allowing a small number of virtual topology reconfigurations over time."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10395","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10396","fieldValue":"Van Der Schaar, Mihaela"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10396","fieldValue":" Distributed medium access control (MAC) protocols are essential for the proliferation of low-cost, decentralized wireless local area networks (WLANs). Most MAC protocols are designed with the presumption that nodes comply with prescribed rules. However, selfish nodes have natural motives to manipulate protocols in order to improve their own performance. This often degrades the performance of other nodes as well as that of the overall system. In this paper, we propose a class of protocols that limit the performance gain from selfish manipulation while incurring only a small efficiency loss. The proposed protocols are based on the idea of a review strategy, with which nodes collect signals about the actions of other nodes over a period of time, use a statistical test to infer whether or not other nodes are following the prescribed behavior, and trigger a punishment if a deviation is inferred. We consider the cases of private and public signals and provide analytical and numerical results to demonstrate the properties of the proposed protocols."}
