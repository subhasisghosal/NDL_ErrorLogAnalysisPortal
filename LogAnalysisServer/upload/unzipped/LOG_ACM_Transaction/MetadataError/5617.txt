Narrow surface features can partially shield charged atoms from the high-dielectric solvent, enhancing electrostatic potentials inside the cavity and projecting electric field lines outward into the solvent. This effect has been observed in many instances and is widely considered in the human examination of molecular structure, but it is rarely integrated into the digital representations used in protein structure comparison software. To create a computational representation of electrostatic focusing, that is compatible with structure comparison algorithms, this paper presents an approach that generates three-dimensional solids that approximate regions where focusing occurs. We verify the accuracy of this representation against instances of focusing in proteins and DNA. Noting that this representation also identifies thin focusing regions on the molecular surface that are unlikely to affect binding, we describe a second algorithm that conservatively isolates larger focusing regions. The resulting 3D solids can be compared with Boolean set operations, permitting a new range of analyses on the regions where electrostatic focusing occurs. They also represent a novel integration of molecular shape and electrostatic focusing into the same structure comparison framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4959","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4959","fieldValue":"Electrostatic focusing, protein structure comparison, constructive solid geometry, structural bioinformatics"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4959","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4959","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4960","fieldValue":" String kernel-based machine learning methods have yielded great success in practical tasks of structured\/sequential data analysis. They often exhibit state-of-the-art performance on many practical tasks of sequence analysis such as biological sequence classification, remote homology detection, or protein superfamily and fold prediction. However, typical string kernel methods rely on the analysis of discrete 1D string data (e.g., DNA or amino acid sequences). In this paper, we address the multiclass biological sequence classification problems using multivariate representations in the form of sequences of features vectors (as in biological sequence profiles, or sequences of individual amino acid physicochemical descriptors) and a class of multivariate string kernels that exploit these representations. On three protein sequence classification tasks, the proposed multivariate representations and kernels show significant 15-20 percent improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art sequence classification methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4960","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4960","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4960","fieldValue":"ACM"}
