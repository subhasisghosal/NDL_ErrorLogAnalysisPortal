Specifically, the measures at hand are the network average and global clustering coefficients and the number of registered users. The algorithms at hand (1) assume no prior knowledge about the network and (2) access the network using only the publicly available interface. More precisely, this work provides (a) a unified approach for clustering coefficients estimation and (b) a new network size estimator. The unified approach for the clustering coefficients yields the first external access algorithm for estimating the global clustering coefficient. The new network size estimator offers improved accuracy compared to prior art estimators. Our approach is to view a social network as an undirected graph and use the public interface to retrieve a random walk. To estimate the clustering coefficient, the connectivity of each node in the random walk sequence is tested in turn. We show that the error drops exponentially in the number of random walk steps. For the network size estimation we offer a generalized view of prior art estimators that in turn yields an improved estimator. All algorithms are validated on several publicly available social network datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23325","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23325","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23326","fieldValue":" The Web 2.0 brought new requirements to the architecture of web systems. Web applicationsâ\u20AC™ interfaces are becoming more and more interactive. However, these changes are severely impacting how disabled users interact through assistive technologies with the web. In order to deploy an accessible web application, developers can use WAI-ARIA to design an accessible web application, which manually implements focus and keyboard navigation mechanisms. This article presents a quantitative metric, named Fona, which measures how the Focus Navigation WAI-ARIA requirement has been implemented on the web. Fona counts JavaScript mouse event listeners, HTML elements with role attributes, and TabIndex attributes in the DOM structure of webpages. Fonaâ\u20AC™s evaluation approach provides a narrow analysis of one single accessibility requirement. But it enables monitoring this accessibility requirement in a large number of webpages. This monitoring activity might be used to give insights about how Focus Navigation and ARIA requirements have been considered by web development teams. Fona is validated comparing the results of a set of WAI-ARIA conformant implementations and a set of webpages formed by Alexaâ\u20AC™s 349 top most popular websites. The analysis of Fonaâ\u20AC™s value for Alexaâ\u20AC™s websites highlights that many websites still lack the implementation of Focus Navigation through their JavaScript interactive content."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23326","fieldValue":"ARIA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23326","fieldValue":"ACM"}
