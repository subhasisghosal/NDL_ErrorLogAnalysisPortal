The monotonic property of domino logic aggravates the min-delay path failure through coupling-induced speedup. To tackle the min-delay problem for domino logic, we propose a min-delay optimization algorithm considering coupling effects. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm yields a significant increase of min-delay without incurring max-delay violation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12864","fieldValue":" Simulation-based power estimation is commonly used for its high accuracy despite excessive computation times. Techniques have been proposed to speed it up by compacting an input sequence while preserving its power-consumption characteristics. We propose a novel method to compact a sequence that preserves transition frequencies. We prove the problem is NP-complete, and propose a graph model to reduce it to that of finding a heaviest-weighted trail, and a heuristic utilizing this model. We also propose using multiple sequences for better accuracy with even shorter sequences. Experiments show that power dissipation can be estimated with an error of only 2.3&percnt;, while simulation times are reduced by 10. Proposed methods generate solutions that effectively preserve transition frequencies and that are very close to optimal. Experiments also show that multiple sequences grant more accurate results with even shorter sequences."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12864","fieldValue":"ACM"}
