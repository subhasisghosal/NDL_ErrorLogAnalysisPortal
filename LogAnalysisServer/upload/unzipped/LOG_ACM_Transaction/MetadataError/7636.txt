{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10081","fieldValue":" If optical routers are to become reality, we will need several new optical technologies, one of which is to build sufficiently large optical buffers. Building optical buffers for routers is daunting: Today's electronic routers often holdmillions of packets, which is well beyond the capabilities of optical technology. In this paper, we argue that two new results offer a solution. First, we show that the size of buffers in backbone routers can be made very small--just about 20 packets per linecard--at the expense of a small loss in throughput. Second, we show that integrated delay line optical buffers can store a few dozen packets on a photonic chip. With the combination of these two results, we conclude that future Internet routers could use optical buffers."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10081","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10081","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10081","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10081","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10082","fieldValue":" With the fast progress of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology and its growing applications in networks, it is important to develop techniques to enable more efficient MIMO network communications. However, it is very challenging to coordinate node transmissions in a MIMO-based ad hoc network. In this work, we propose schemes that take advantage of the meshed topology of ad hoc networks to fully exploit the multiuser diversity and spatial diversity in order to maximize the data rate of the network while supporting different transmission priorities, reducing transmission delay, and ensuring fair transmissions among nodes. We formulate a concrete physical model and present cross-layer centralized and distributed scheduling algorithms that exploit physical-layer channel information to opportunistically schedule cooperative spatial multiplexed transmissions between nodes. We also propose a new MAC scheme to support our distributed algorithm. The performance of our algorithms are studied through extensive simulations, and the results demonstrate that our algorithms are very effective and can significantly increase the network throughput while reducing the transmission delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10082","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10082","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10082","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10083","fieldValue":" We consider static ad hoc wireless networks comprising significant inhomogeneities in the node spatial distribution over the area and analyze the scaling laws of their transport capacity as the number of nodes increases. In particular, we consider nodes placed according to a shot-noise Cox process (SNCP), which allows to model the clustering behavior usually recognized in large-scale systems. For this class of networks, we propose novel scheduling and routing schemes that approach previously computed upper bounds to the per-flow throughput as the number of nodes tends to infinity."}
