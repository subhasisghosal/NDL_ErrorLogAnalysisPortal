High-radix routers reduce network cost by lowering the network diameter while providing a high bisection bandwidth and path diversity. The building blocks of these large-scale networks are the routers or the switches and they need to scale accordingly to the increasing port count and increasing pin bandwidth. However, as the port count increases, the high-radix router microarchitecture itself needs to scale efficiently. Hierarchical crossbar switch organization has been proposed where a single large crossbar used for a router switch is partitioned into many small crossbars and overcomes the limitations of conventional router microarchitecture. Although the organization provides high performance, it has limited scalability due to excessive power and area overheads by the wires and intermediate buffers. In this article, we propose scalable router microarchitectures that leverage a network within the switch design of the high-radix routers themselves. These alternative designs lower the wiring complexity and buffer requirements. For example, when a folded-Clos switch is used instead of the hierarchical crossbar switch for a radix-64 router, it provides up to 73&percnt;, 58&percnt;, and 87&percnt; reduction in area, energy-delay product, and energy-delay-area product, respectively. We also explore more efficient switch designs by exploiting the traffic-pattern characteristics of the global network and its impact on the local network design within the switch for both folded-Clos and flattened butterfly networks. In particular, we propose a bilateral butterfly switch organization that has fewer crossbars and global wires compared to the topology-agnostic folded-Clos switch while achieving better low-load latency and equivalent saturation throughput."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1858","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1858","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9510","fieldValue":" A central problem in personal communication systems is to optimize bandwidth usage, while providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to mobile users. Network mobility management, and in particular, location management, consumes a significant portion of bandwidth, which is a necessary overhead for supporting mobile users. We focus our efforts on minimizing this overhead. Unlike previous works, we concentrate on optimizing existing schemes, and so the algorithms we present are easily incorporated into current networks. We present the first polynomial time approximation algorithms for minimum bandwidth location management. In planar graphs, our algorithm provably generates a solution that uses no more than a constant factor more bandwidth than the optimal solution. In general graphs, our algorithm provably generates a solution that uses just a factor O(log n) more bandwidth than optimal where n is the number of base stations in the network. We show that, in practice, our algorithm produces near-optimal results and outperforms other schemes that are described in the literature. For the important case of the line graph, we present a polynomial-time optimal algorithm. Finally, we illustrate that our algorithm can also be used for optimizing the handoff mechanism."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9510","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9510","fieldValue":"ACM"}
