Based on the idea of collaborative filtering, this article presents unsupervised methods to refine the initial scores generated by concept classifiers by taking into account the concept-to-concept correlation and shot-to-shot similarity embedded within the score matrix. Given a noisy matrix, we refine the inaccurate scores via matrix factorization. This method is further improved by learning multiple local models and incorporating contextual-temporal structures. Experiments on the TRECVID 2006--2008 datasets demonstrate relative performance gains ranging from 13&percnt; to 52&percnt; without using any user annotations or external knowledge resources."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25449","fieldValue":"TRECVID"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25449","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25449","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25450","fieldValue":" A lot of people around the world commute using public transportation and would like to spend this time viewing streamed video content such as news or sports updates. However, mobile wireless networks typically suffer from severe bandwidth fluctuations, and the networks are often completely unresponsive for several seconds, sometimes minutes. Today, there are several ways of adapting the video bitrate and thus the video quality to such fluctuations, for example, using scalable video codecs or segmented adaptive HTTP streaming that switches between nonscalable video streams encoded in different bitrates. Still, for a better long-term video playout experience that avoids disruptions and frequent quality changes while using existing video adaptation technology, it is desirable to perform bandwidth prediction and planned quality adaptation. This article describes a video streaming system for receivers equipped with a GPS. A receiver's download rate is constantly monitored, and periodically reported back to a central database along with associated GPS positional data. Thus, based on the current location, a streaming device can use a GPS-based bandwidth-lookup service in order to better predict the near-future bandwidth availability and create a schedule for the video playout that takes likely future availability into account. To create a prototype and perform initial tests, we conducted several field trials while commuting using public transportation. We show how our database has been used to predict bandwidth fluctuations and network outages, and how this information helps maintain uninterrupted playback with less compromise on video quality than possible without prediction."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25450","fieldValue":"GPS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25450","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25450","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3458","fieldValue":"Martin, Jean-Claude"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3458","fieldValue":" Several studies have investigated the relevance of haptics to physically convey various types of emotion. However, they use basic analysis approaches to identify the relevant features for an effective communication of emotion. This article presents an advanced analysis approach, based on the clustering technique, that enables the extraction of the general features of affective haptic expressions as well as the identification of specific features in order to discriminate between close emotions that are difficult to differentiate. This approach was tested in the context of affective communication through a virtual handshake. It uses a haptic device, which enables the expression of 3D movements. The results of this research were compared to those of the standard Analysis of Variance method in order to highlight the advantages and limitations of each approach."}
