This result generalizes the recent deterministic logspace algorithm for S-T Connectivity on undirected graphs [Reingold, 2008]. It identifies knowledge of the stationary distribution as the gap between the S-T Connectivity problems we know how to solve in logspace (L) and those that capture all of randomized logspace (RL)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2493","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2493","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15754","fieldValue":"Lensch, Hendrik PA"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15754","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15754","fieldValue":" Image-based relighting achieves high quality in rendering, but it requires a large number of measurements of the reflectance field. This article discusses sampling techniques that improve on the trade-offs between measurement effort and reconstruction quality. Specifically, we (i) demonstrate that sampling with point lights and from a sparse set of incoming light directions creates artifacts which can be reduced significantly by employing extended light sources for sampling, (ii) propose a sampling algorithm which incrementally chooses light directions adapted to the properties of the reflectance field being measured, thus capturing significant features faster than fixed-pattern sampling, and (iii) combine reflectance fields from two different light domain resolutions. We present an automated measurement setup for well-defined angular distributions of the incident, indirect illumination. It is based on programmable spotlights with controlled aperture that illuminate the walls around the scene."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15754","fieldValue":"ACM"}
