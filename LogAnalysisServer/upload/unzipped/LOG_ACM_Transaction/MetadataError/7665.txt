ISEs can use architecturally visible storage (AVS), localized compiler-controlled memories, to provide higher I\/O bandwidth than reading data from the processor pipeline. AVS creates coherence and consistence problems with the data cache. Although a hardware coherence protocol could solve the problem, this approach is costly for a single-processor system. As a low-cost alternative, we introduce Virtual Ways, which ensures coherence through a reduced form of inclusion between the data cache and AVS. Virtual Ways achieve higher performance and lower energy consumption than using a hardware coherence protocol."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10141","fieldValue":" A key challenge of routing in delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) is finding routes that have high delivery rates and low end-to-end delays. When future connectivity information is not available, opportunistic routing is preferred in DTNs, in which messages are forwarded to nodes with higher delivery probabilities. We observe that real objects have repetitive motions, whereas no prior research work has investigated the time-varying delivery probabilities of messages between nodes at different times during a repetition of motion of the nodes. We propose to use the expected minimum delay (EMD) as a new delivery probability metric in DTNs with repetitive but nondeterministic mobility. First, we model the network as a probabilistic time-space graph with historical contact information or prior knowledge about the network. We then translate it into a probabilistic state-space graph, in which the time dimension is removed. With the state-space graph, we apply the Markov decision process to derive the EMDs of the messages. We propose an EMD-based probabilistic routing protocol, called routing in cyclic MobiSpace (RCM). To make RCM more practical, we show a simple extension that reduces routing information exchanged among nodes. We perform simulations with real and synthetic traces. Simulation results show that RCM outperforms several existing opportunistic routing protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10141","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10141","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10141","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10142","fieldValue":" A main design issue in a wireless data broadcasting system is to choose between push-based and pull-based logic: The former is used as a low-cost solution, while the latter is preferred when performance is of utmost importance. Therefore, the most significant advantage of a push system is the minimal cost. This fact implies that hardware limitations do exist in the case of push systems. As a consequence, every related proposed algorithm should primarily be cost-effective. This attribute, however, has been overlooked in related research. In this paper, popular broadcast scheduling approaches are tested from an implementation cost aspect, and the results render them only conditionally realizable. Moreover, a new, cost-effective, adaptivity oriented schedule constructor is proposed as a realistic, minimal-cost solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10142","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
