It is important in fulfilling the requirements of differentiated services. To achieve fast packet classification, a new approach, namely \"filter rephrasing,\" is proposed to encode the original filters by exploiting the hierarchical property of the filters. Filter rephrasing could dramatically reduce the search and storage complexity incurred in packet classification. We incorporate a well-known scheme-rectangle search-with filter rephrasing to improve the lookup speed by at least a factor of 2 and decreases 70% of the storage expenses. As compared with other existing schemes, the proposed scheme exhibits a better balance between speed, storage, and computation complexity. Consequently, the scalable effect of filter rephrasing is suitable for backbone routers with a great number of filters."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9641","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9641","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9641","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9642","fieldValue":" Most existing available-bandwidth measurement techniques are justified using a constant-rate fluid cross-traffic model. To achieve a better understanding of the performance of current bandwidth measurement techniques in general traffic conditions, this paper presents a queueing-theoretic foundation of single-hop packet-train bandwidth estimation under bursty arrivals of discrete cross-traffic packets. We analyze the statistical mean of the packet-train output dispersion and its mathematical relationship to the input dispersion, which we call the probing-response curve. This analysis allows us to prove that the single-hop response curve in bursty cross-traffic deviates from that obtained under fluid cross traffic of the same average intensity and to demonstrate that this may lead to significant measurement bias in certain estimation techniques based on fluid models. We conclude the paper by showing, both analytically and experimentally, that the response-curve deviation vanishes as the packet-train length or probing packet size increases, where the vanishing rate is decided by the burstiness of cross-traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9642","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9642","fieldValue":"ACM"}
