Recently, there has been some interest in analyzing the dynamical evolution of state probabilities of these systems. In this article, we show that verifying linear temporal properties concerning the state evolution induced by a Markov chain is equivalent to the decidability of the Skolem problem -- a long-standing open problem in Number Theory. However, from a practical point of view, usually it is enough to check properties up to some acceptable error bound &epsi;. We show that an approximate version of the Skolem problem is decidable, and that it can be applied to verify, up to arbitrarily small &epsi;, linear temporal properties of the state evolution induced by a Markov chain."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11732","fieldValue":"Decidability of Approximate Skolem Problem and Applications to Logical Verification of Dynamical Properties of Markov Chains"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11733","fieldValue":" We develop a fully algorithmic approach to â\u20ACœtamingâ\u20AC? logics expressed Hilbert style, that is, reformulating them in terms of analytic sequent calculi and useful semantics. Our approach applies to Hilbert calculi extending the positive fragment of propositional classical logic with axioms of a certain general form that contain new unary connectives. Our work encompasses various results already obtained for specific logics. It can be applied to new logics, as well as to known logics for which an analytic calculus or a useful semantics has so far not been available.

Existing methods consider a setting in which systems and their correctness are Boolean. In recent years, there has been growing interest and need for quantitative formal methods, where systems may be weighted and specifications may be multivalued. Weighted automata, which map input words to a numerical value, play a key role in quantitative reasoning. Technically, every transition in a weighted automaton A has a cost, and the value A assigns to a finite word w is the sum of the costs on the transitions traversed along the most expensive accepting run of A on w. We study parameterized weighted containment: given three weighted automata A, B, and C, with B being partial, the goal is to find an assignment to the missing costs in B so that we end up with Bâ\u20AC² for which Bâ\u20AC²â\u2030¤ C, where â\u2030¤ is the weighted counterpart of containment. We also consider a one-sided version of the problem, where only A or only C is given in addition to B, and the goal is to find a minimal assignment with which Aâ\u2030¤ Bâ\u20AC² or, respectively, a maximal one with which Bâ\u20AC² â\u2030¤ C. We argue that both problems are useful in stepwise design of weighted systems as well as approximated minimization of weighted automata. We show that when the automata are deterministic, we can solve the problems in polynomial time. Our solution is based on the observation that the set of legal assignments to k missing costs forms a k-dimensional polytope. The technical challenge is to find an assignment in polynomial time even though the polytope is defined by means of exponentially many inequalities. We do so by developing a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on a separation oracle for polytopes. For nondeterministic automata, the weighted setting is much more complex, and in fact even nonparameterized containment is undecidable. We are able to show positive results for variants of the problems, where containment is replaced by simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11734","fieldValue":"ACM"}
