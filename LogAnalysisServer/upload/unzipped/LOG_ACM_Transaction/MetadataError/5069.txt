{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3834","fieldValue":" The generated speech of hidden Markov model (HMM)-based statistical parametric speech synthesis still sounds \"muffled.\" One cause of this degradation in speech quality may be the loss of fine spectral structures. In this paper, we propose to use a deep generative architecture, a deep neural network (DNN) generatively trained, as a postfilter. The network models the conditional probability of the spectrum of natural speech given that of synthetic speech to compensate for such gap between synthetic and natural speech. The proposed probabilistic postfilter is generatively trained by cascading two restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) or deep belief networks (DBNs) with one bidirectional associative memory (BAM). We devised two types of DNN postfilters: one operating in the mel-cepstral domain and the other in the higher dimensional spectral domain. We compare these two new data-driven postfilters with other types of postfilters that are currently used in speech synthesis: a fixed mel-cepstral based postfilter, the global variance based parameter generation, and the modulation spectrum-based enhancement. Subjective evaluations using the synthetic voices of a male and female speaker confirmed that the proposed DNN-based postfilter in the spectral domain significantly improved the segmental quality of synthetic speech compared to that with conventional methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3834","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3834","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3835","fieldValue":"Kang, Hong-Goo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3835","fieldValue":" This paper proposes an a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimator using an air-conduction (AC) and a bone-conduction (BC) microphone. Among various ways of combining AC and BC microphones for speech enhancement, it is shown that the total enhancement performance can be maximized if the BC microphone is utilized for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of the desired speech signal. Considering the fact that a small deviation in the speech PSD estimation process brings severe spectral distortion, this paper focuses on controlling weighting factors while estimating the a priori SNR with the decision-directed approach framework. The time--frequency varying weighting factor that is determined by taking a minimum mean square error criterion improves the capability of eliminating residual noise and minimizing speech distortion. Since the weighting factors are also adjusted by measuring the usefulness of the AC and BC microphones, the proposed approach is suitable for tracking the parameter even if the characteristic of environment changes rapidly. The simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm to conventional algorithms in high noise environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/3835","fieldValue":"<i>a priori<\/i> signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3835","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3835","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1292","fieldValue":"Chan, W K"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1292","fieldValue":"Tse, T H"}
