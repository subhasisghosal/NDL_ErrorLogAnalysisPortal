This mechanism targets at avoiding the problems of lack of synchronization between metric and rate selection decisions and inaccurate link quality estimates, common to main existing proposals of multihop wireless routing metrics and automatic rate adaptation. In this proposal, the statistics collected by the routing protocol are used by the rate adaptation algorithm to compute the best rate for each wireless link. This coordinated decision aims at providing better routing and rate choices. In addition to the basic MARA algorithm, two variations are proposed: MARA-P and MARA-RP. The first considers the size of each packet in the transmission rate decision. The second variation considers the packet size also for the routing choices. For evaluation purposes, experiments were conducted on both real and simulated environments. In these experiments, MARA was compared to a number of rate adaptation algorithms and routing metrics. Results from both environments indicate that MARA may lead to an overall network performance improvement."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10328","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10328","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10328","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10329","fieldValue":" Human communication has changed by the advent of smartphones. Using commonplace mobile device features, they started uploading large amounts of content that increases. This increase in demand will overwhelm capacity and limits the providers' ability to provide the quality of service demanded by their users. In the absence of technical solutions, cellular network providers are considering changing billing plans to address this. Our contributions are twofold. First, by analyzing user content upload behavior, we find that the user-generated content problem is a user behavioral problem. Particularly, by analyzing user mobility and data logs of 2 million users of one of the largest US cellular providers, we find that: 1) users upload content from a small number of locations; 2) because such locations are different for users, we find that the problem appears ubiquitous. However, we find that: 3) there exists a significant lag between content generation and uploading times, and 4) with respect to users, it is always the same users to delay. Second, we propose a cellular network architecture. Our approach proposes capacity upgrades at a select number of locations called Drop Zones. Although not particularly popular for uploads originally, Drop Zones seamlessly fall within the natural movement patterns of a large number of users. They are therefore suited for uploading larger quantities of content in a postponed manner. We design infrastructure placement algorithms and demonstrate that by upgrading infrastructure in only 963 base stations across the entire US, it is possible to deliver 50% of content via Drop Zones."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10329","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10329","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10329","fieldValue":"ACM"}
