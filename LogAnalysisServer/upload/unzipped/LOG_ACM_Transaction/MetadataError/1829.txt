{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16409","fieldValue":" Procedural representations provide powerful means for generating complex geometric structures. They are also notoriously difficult to control. In this article, we present an algorithm for controlling grammar-based procedural models. Given a grammar and a high-level specification of the desired production, the algorithm computes a production from the grammar that conforms to the specification. This production is generated by optimizing over the space of possible productions from the grammar. The algorithm supports specifications of many forms, including geometric shapes and analytical objectives. We demonstrate the algorithm on procedural models of trees, cities, buildings, and Mondrian paintings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16410","fieldValue":" We propose a new high-quality and efficient single-image upscaling technique that extends existing example-based super-resolution frameworks. In our approach we do not rely on an external example database or use the whole input image as a source for example patches. Instead, we follow a local self-similarity assumption on natural images and extract patches from extremely localized regions in the input image. This allows us to reduce considerably the nearest-patch search time without compromising quality in most images. Tests, that we perform and report, show that the local self-similarity assumption holds better for small scaling factors where there are more example patches of greater relevance. We implement these small scalings using dedicated novel nondyadic filter banks, that we derive based on principles that model the upscaling process. Moreover, the new filters are nearly biorthogonal and hence produce high-resolution images that are highly consistent with the input image without solving implicit back-projection equations. The local and explicit nature of our algorithm makes it simple, efficient, and allows a trivial parallel implementation on a GPU. We demonstrate the new method ability to produce high-quality resolution enhancement, its application to video sequences with no algorithmic modification, and its efficiency to perform real-time enhancement of low-resolution video standard into recent high-definition formats."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16411","fieldValue":" Color perception is recognized to vary with surrounding spatial structure, but the impact of edge smoothness on color has not been studied in color appearance modeling. In this work, we study the appearance of color under different degrees of edge smoothness. A psychophysical experiment was conducted to quantify the change in perceived lightness, colorfulness, and hue with respect to edge smoothness. We confirm that color appearance, in particular lightness, changes noticeably with increased smoothness. Based on our experimental data, we have developed a computational model that predicts this appearance change. The model can be integrated into existing color appearance models. We demonstrate the applicability of our model on a number of examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16411","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16411","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16412","fieldValue":" We present an interactive procedural modeling system for the exterior of architectural models. Our modeling system is based on procedural extrusions of building footprints. The main novelty of our work is that we can model difficult architectural surfaces in a procedural framework, for example, curved roofs, overhanging roofs, dormer windows, interior dormer windows, roof constructions with vertical walls, buttresses, chimneys, bay windows, columns, pilasters, and alcoves. We present a user interface to interactively specify procedural extrusions, a sweep plane algorithm to compute a two-manifold architectural surface, and applications to architectural modeling."}
