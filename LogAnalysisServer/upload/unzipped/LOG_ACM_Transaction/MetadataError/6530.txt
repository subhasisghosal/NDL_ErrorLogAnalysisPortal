{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7405","fieldValue":" The proliferation of MP3 players and the exploding amount of digital music content call for novel ways of music organization and retrieval to meet the ever-increasing demand for easy and effective information access. As almost every music piece is created to convey emotion, music organization and retrieval by emotion is a reasonable way of accessing music information. A good deal of effort has been made in the music information retrieval community to train a machine to automatically recognize the emotion of a music signal. A central issue of machine recognition of music emotion is the conceptualization of emotion and the associated emotion taxonomy. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of different ways of emotion annotation, model training, and result visualization. This article provides a comprehensive review of the methods that have been proposed for music emotion recognition. Moreover, as music emotion recognition is still in its infancy, there are many open issues. We review the solutions that have been proposed to address these issues and conclude with suggestions for further research."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7406","fieldValue":" Reliable video content analysis is an essential prerequisite for effective video search. An important current research question is how to develop robust video content analysis methods that produce satisfactory results for a large variety of video sources, distribution platforms, genres, and content. The work presented in this article exploits the observation that the appearance of objects and events is often related to a particular video sequence, episode, program, or broadcast. This motivates our idea of considering the content analysis task for a single video or episode as a transductive setting: the final classification model must be optimal for the given video only, and not in general, as expected for inductive learning. For this purpose, the unlabeled video test data have to be used in the learning process. In this article, a transductive learning framework for robust video content analysis based on feature selection and ensemble classification is presented. In contrast to related transductive approaches for video analysis (e.g., for concept detection), the framework is designed in a general manner and not only for a single task. The proposed framework is applied to the following video analysis tasks: shot boundary detection, face recognition, semantic video retrieval, and semantic indexing of computer game sequences. Experimental results for diverse video analysis tasks and large test sets demonstrate that the proposed transductive framework improves the robustness of the underlying state-of-the-art approaches, whereas transductive support vector machines do not solve particular tasks in a satisfactory manner."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7407","fieldValue":" Human motion recognition in video data has several interesting applications in fields such as gaming, senior\/assisted-living environments, and surveillance. In these scenarios, we may have to consider adding new motion classes (i.e., new types of human motions to be recognized), as well as new training data (e.g., for handling different type of subjects). Hence, both the accuracy of classification and training time for the machine learning algorithms become important performance parameters in these cases. In this article, we propose a knowledge-based hybrid (KBH) method that can compute the probabilities for hidden Markov models (HMMs) associated with different human motion classes. This computation is facilitated by appropriately mixing features from two different media types (3D motion capture and 2D video). We conducted a variety of experiments comparing the proposed KBH for HMMs and the traditional Baum-Welch algorithms. With the advantage of computing the HMM parameter in a noniterative manner, the KBH method outperforms the Baum-Welch algorithm both in terms of accuracy as well as in reduced training time. Moreover, we show in additional experiments that the KBH method also outperforms the linear support vector machine (SVM)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7408","fieldValue":" Intelligent video surveillance is currently one of the most active research topics in computer vision, especially when facing the explosion of video data captured by a large number of surveillance cameras. As a key step of an intelligent surveillance system, robust visual tracking is very challenging for computer vision. However, it is a basic functionality of the human visual system (HVS). Psychophysical findings have shown that the receptive fields of simple cells in the visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented, and bandpass, and it forms a sparse, distributed representation of natural images. In this article, motivated by these findings, we propose an effective appearance model based on sparse coding and apply it in visual tracking. Specifically, we consider the responses of general basis functions extracted by independent component analysis on a large set of natural image patches as features and model the appearance of the tracked target as the probability distribution of these features. In order to make the tracker more robust to partial occlusion, camouflage environments, pose changes, and illumination changes, we further select features that are related to the target based on an entropy-gain criterion and ignore those that are not. The target is finally represented by the probability distribution of those related features. The target search is performed by minimizing the Matusita distance between the distributions of the target model and a candidate using Newton-style iterations. The experimental results validate that the proposed method is more robust and effective than three state-of-the-art methods."}
