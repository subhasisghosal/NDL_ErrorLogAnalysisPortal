It serves both as a method for data fitting with preservation of shape properties or more general constraints, and as a means of computer aided geometric design of curves in two or three dimensions. The package is based on a translation of Algorithm 716 from Fortran 77 into MATLAB. The translation includes bug corrections, vectorization where possible, and extensions, including a B-spline representation, designed to facilitate curve design as opposed to data fitting. An interactive graphical user interface, not part of the algorithm, is available from the author."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19242","fieldValue":" The Rice Vector Library is a collection of C++ classes expressing core concepts (vector, function,â\u20AC¦) of calculus in Hilbert space with minimal implementation dependence, and providing standardized interfaces behind which to hide application-dependent implementation details (data containers, function objects). A variety of coordinate-free algorithms from linear algebra and optimization, including Krylov subspace methods and various relatives of Newton's method for nonlinear equations and constrained and unconstrained optimization, may be expressed purely in terms of this system of classes. The resulting code may be used without alteration in a wide range of control, design, and parameter estimation applications, in serial and parallel computing environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19242","fieldValue":"A software framework for abstract expression of coordinate-free linear algebra and optimization algorithms"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19243","fieldValue":" Direct methods for solving large sparse linear systems of equations are popular because of their generality and robustness. Their main weakness is that the memory they require usually increases rapidly with problem size. We discuss the design and development of the first release of a new symmetric direct solver that aims to circumvent this limitation by allowing the system matrix, intermediate data, and the matrix factors to be stored externally. The code, which is written in Fortran and called HSL_MA77, implements a multifrontal algorithm. The first release is for positive-definite systems and performs a Cholesky factorization. Special attention is paid to the use of efficient dense linear algebra kernel codes that handle the full-matrix operations on the frontal matrix and to the input\/output operations. The input\/output operations are performed using a separate package that provides a virtual-memory system and allows the data to be spread over many files; for very large problems these may be held on more than one device. Numerical results are presented for a collection of 30 large real-world problems, all of which were solved successfully."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19243","fieldValue":"ACM"}
