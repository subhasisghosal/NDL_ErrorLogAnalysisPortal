The goal is to find a path originating at r that minimizes the total ‚\u20ACúcover time‚\u20AC? of all functions. This generalizes well-studied problems, such as Submodular Ranking [Azar and Gamzu 2011] and the Group Steiner Tree [Garg et al. 2000]. We give a polynomial time O(log 1\/&epsi; ƒ\u2039 log2+Œ\u201D&verbar;V&verbar;)-approximation algorithm for MLSC, where &epsi; > 0 is the smallest non-zero marginal increase of any {fi}mi &equals; 1 and Œ\u201D > 0 is any constant. We also consider the Latency Covering Steiner Tree (LCST) problem, which is the special case of MLSC where the fi$s are multi-coverage functions. This is a common generalization of the Latency Group Steiner Tree [Gupta et al. 2010; Chakrabarty and Swamy 2011] and Generalized Min-sum Set Cover [Azar et al. 2009; Bansal et al. 2010] problems. We obtain an O(log 2$&verbar;V&verbar;)-approximation algorithm for LCST. Finally, we study a natural stochastic extension of the Submodular Ranking problem and obtain an adaptive algorithm with an O(log 1\/&epsi;)-approximation ratio, which is best possible. This result also generalizes some previously studied stochastic optimization problems, such as Stochastic Set Cover [Goemans and Vondr√°k 2006] and Shared Filter Evaluation [Munagala et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2008]."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18567","fieldValue":" It has been observed that for problems of low dimension the transformations used in the implementation of singly-implicit Runge-Kutta methods consume an unreasonable share of the total computational costs. Two proposals for reducing these costs are presented here. The first makes use of an alternative transformation for which the combined operation counts of the transformations together with the iterations themselves are lower than for the standard implementation scheme for singly-implicit methods. The second proposal is to use a Runge-Kutta method for which the first row of the coefficient matrix is zero but which still possesses acceptable stability properties. It is hoped that by combining these two proposals increased efficiency in the implementation of Runge-Kutta methods for stiff problems can be achieved."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18567","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18567","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/18568","fieldValue":"Van Ness, John"}
