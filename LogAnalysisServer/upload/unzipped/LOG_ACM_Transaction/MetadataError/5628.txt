Correctly identifying and aligning these sequence biological similarities help from unwinding the mystery of species evolution to drug design. We present our knowledge-based multiple sequence alignment (KB-MSA) technique that utilizes the existing knowledge databases such as SWISSPROT, GENBANK, or HOMSTRAD to provide a more realistic and reliable sequence alignment. We also provide a modified version of this algorithm (CB-MSA) that utilizes the sequence consistency information when sequence knowledge databases are not available. Our benchmark tests on BAliBASE, PREFAB, HOMSTRAD, and SABMARK references show accuracy improvements up to 10 percent on twilight data sets against many leading alignment tools such as ISPALIGN, PADT, CLUSTALW, MAFFT, PROBCONS, and T-COFFEE."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4979","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4979","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4979","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4980","fieldValue":" Scaffold filling is a new combinatorial optimization problem in genome sequencing. The one-sided scaffold filling problem can be described as given an incomplete genome $(I)$ and a complete (reference) genome $(G)$, fill the missing genes into $(I)$ such that the number of common (string) adjacencies between the resulting genome $(I^{\\prime })$ and $(G)$ is maximized. This problem is NP-complete for genome with duplicated genes and the best known approximation factor is 1.33, which uses a greedy strategy. In this paper, we prove a better lower bound of the optimal solution, and devise a new algorithm by exploiting the maximum matching method and a local improvement technique, which improves the approximation factor to 1.25. For genome with gene repetitions, this is the only known NP-complete problem which admits an approximation with a small constant factor (less than 1.5)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4980","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4981","fieldValue":" In an extension of previous work, here we introduce a second-order optimization method for determining optimal paths from the substrate to a target product of a metabolic network, through which the amount of the target is maximum. An objective function for the said purpose, along with certain linear constraints, is considered and minimized. The basis vectors spanning the null space of the stoichiometric matrix, depicting the metabolic network, are computed, and their convex combinations satisfying the constraints are considered as flux vectors. A set of other constraints, incorporating weighting coefficients corresponding to the enzymes in the pathway, are considered. These weighting coefficients appear in the objective function to be minimized. During minimization, the values of these weighting coefficients are estimated and learned. These values, on minimization, represent an optimal pathway, depicting optimal enzyme concentrations, leading to overproduction of the target. The results on various networks demonstrate the usefulness of the methodology in the domain of metabolic engineering. A comparison with the standard gradient descent and the extreme pathway analysis technique is also performed. Unlike the gradient descent method, the present method, being independent of the learning parameter, exhibits improved results."}
