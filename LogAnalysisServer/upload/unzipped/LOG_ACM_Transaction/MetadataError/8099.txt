This work, to the authors' knowledge, represents the first online combinatorial auction designed for the cloud computing paradigm, which is general and expressive enough to both: 1 optimize system efficiency across the temporal domain instead of at an isolated time point; and 2 model dynamic provisioning of heterogeneous virtual machine VM types in practice. The final result is an online auction framework that is truthful, computationally efficient, and guarantees a competitive ratio â\u2030ˆ 3.30 in social welfare in typical scenarios. The framework consists of three main steps: 1 a tailored primal-dual algorithm that decomposes the long-term optimization into a series of independent one-shot optimization problems, with a small additive loss in competitive ratio; 2 a randomized subframework that applies primal-dual optimization for translating a centralized cooperative social welfare approximation algorithm into an auction mechanism, retaining the competitive ratio while adding truthfulness; and 3 a primal-dual algorithm for approximating the one-shot optimization with a ratio close to e. We also propose two extensions: 1 a binary search algorithm that improves the average-case performance; 2 an improvement to the online auction framework when a minimum budget spending fraction is guaranteed, which produces a better competitive ratio. The efficacy of the online auction framework is validated through theoretical analysis and trace-driven simulation studies. We are also in the hope that the framework can be instructive in auction design for other related problems."}
