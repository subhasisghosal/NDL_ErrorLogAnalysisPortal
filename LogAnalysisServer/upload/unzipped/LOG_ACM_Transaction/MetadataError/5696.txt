The integrated Fortran D compiler relies on two key observations. First, array constructs may be scalarized into FORALL loops without loss of information. Second, loop fusion, partitioning, and sectioning optimizations are essential for both Fortran D dialects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1040","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1040","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1436","fieldValue":"Randolph, Adriane B"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1436","fieldValue":"Moore Jackson, Melody M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1436","fieldValue":" There is a variety of brain-based interface methods which depend on measuring small changes in brain signals or properties. These methods have typically been used for nontraditional assistive technology applications. Non-traditional assistive technology is generally targeted for users with severe motor disabilities which may last long-term due to illness or injury or short-term due to situational disabilities. Control of a nontraditional assistive technology can vary widely across users depending upon many factors ranging from health to experience. Unfortunately, there is no systematic method for assessing usability of nontraditional assistive technologies to achieve the best control. The current methods to accommodate users through trial-and-error result in the loss of valuable time and resources as users sometimes have diminishing abilities or suffer from terminal illnesses. This work describes a methodology for objectively measuring an individualâ\u20AC™s ability to control a specific nontraditional assistive technology, thus expediting the technology-fit process."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1436","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1436","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5109","fieldValue":" Complex diseases such as various types of cancer and diabetes are conjectured to be triggered and influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. To integrate potential effects from interplay among underlying candidate factors, we propose a new network-based framework to identify effective biomarkers by searching for groups of synergistic risk factors with high predictive power to disease outcome. An interaction network is constructed with node weights representing individual predictive power of candidate factors and edge weights capturing pairwise synergistic interactions among factors. We then formulate this network-based biomarker identification problem as a novel graph optimization model to search for multiple cliques with maximum overall weight, which we denote as the Maximum Weighted Multiple Clique Problem (MWMCP). To achieve optimal or near optimal solutions, both an analytical algorithm based on column generation method and a fast heuristic for large-scale networks have been derived. Our algorithms for MWMCP have been implemented to analyze two biomedical data sets: a Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) data set from the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1) study, and a breast cancer genomics data set for metastasis prognosis. The results demonstrate that our network-based methods can identify important biomarkers with better prediction accuracy compared to the conventional feature selection that only considers individual effects."}
