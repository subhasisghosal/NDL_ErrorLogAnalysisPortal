A subset of the vertices S‚ä\u2020 V is independent if all of its members are pairwise nonadjacent, i.e., have no edge between them. A solution to the NP-hard maximum independent set problem is an independent set of maximum cardinality. This article describes gmis, a set of Fortran subroutines to find an approximate solution of a maximum independent set problem. A greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) is used to produce the solutions. The algorithm is described in detail. Implementation and usage of the package is outlined, and computational experiments are reported, illustrating solution quality as a function of running time."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18928","fieldValue":"GRASP"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18928","fieldValue":"Algorithm 787: Fortran subroutines for approximate solution of maximum independent set problems using GRASP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18928","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18928","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18929","fieldValue":" Algorithms with automatic error control are described for the solution of Laplace's equation on both interior and exterior regions, with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The algorithms are based on standard reformulations of each boundary value problem as a boundary integral equation of the second kind. The Nystr√∂m method is used to solve the integral equations, and convergence of arbitrary high order is observed when the boundary data are analytic. The Kelvin transformation is introduced to allow a simple conversion between internal and external problems. Two Fortran program implementations, DRCHLT and NEUMAN, are defined, analyzed, and illustrated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18929","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18929","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18930","fieldValue":" We discuss the computational study of curves of Hopf and double-Hopf points in the software package CONTENT developed at CWI, Amsterdam. These are important points in the numerical study of dynamical systems characterized by the occurrence of one or two conjugate pairs of pure imaginary eigenvalues in the spectrum of the Jacobian matrix. The bialternate product of matrices is extensively used in three codes for the numerical continuation of curves of Hopf points and in one for the continuation of curves of double-Hopf points. In the double-Hopf and two of the single-Hopf cases this is combined with a bordered matrix method. We use this software to find special points on a Hopf curve in a model of chemical oscillations and by computing a Hopf and a double-Hopf curve in a realistic model of a neuron."}
