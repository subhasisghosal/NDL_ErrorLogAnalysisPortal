However, the network bandwidth utilization of transactions has been largely neglected in HTM designs. In this work, we propose a cost model to analyze network bandwidth in transaction execution. The cost model identifies a set of key factors that can be optimized through system design to reduce the communication cost of HTM. Based on the model and network traffic characterization of a representative HTM design, we identify a huge source of superfluous traffic due to failed requests in transaction conflicts. As observed in a spectrum of workloads, 39&percnt; of the transactional requests fail due to conflicts, which renders 58&percnt; of the transactional network traffic futile. To combat this pathology, a novel in-network filtering mechanism is proposed. The on-chip router is augmented to predict conflicts among transactions and proactively filter out those requests that have a high probability to fail. Experimental results show the proposed mechanism reduces total network traffic by 24&percnt; on average for a set of high-contention TM applications, thereby reducing energy consumption by an average of 24&percnt;. Meanwhile, the contention in the coherence directory is reduced by 68&percnt;, on average. These improvements are achieved with only 5&percnt; area added to a conventional on-chip router design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2049","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2049","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11498","fieldValue":" We introduce a uniform approach of representing a variety ofparaconsistent nonmonotonic formalisms by quantified Booleanformulae (QBFs) in the context of multiple-valued logics.

The outcome is a subtle approach to represent theunderlying formalisms, which induces a straightforward way tocompute the corresponding entailments: By incorporatingoff-the-shelf QBF solvers it is possible to simulate within ourframework various kinds of preferential formalisms, among which arePriest's logic LPm of reasoning with minimal inconsistency, Batens'adaptive logic ACLuNs2, Besnard and Schaub's inference $relation&vbar;=_n, a variety of formula-preferentialsystems, some bilattice-based preferential relations (e.g.,&vbar;=I1 and&vbar;=I2), and consequencerelations for reasoning with graded uncertainty, such as thefour-valued logic $&vbar;=^4$c$."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11499","fieldValue":" In this paper we present a translation principle, called the axiomatic translation, for reducing propositional modal logics with background theories, including triangular properties such as transitivity, Euclideanness and functionality, to decidable fragments of first-order logic. The goal of the axiomatic translation principle is to find simplified theories, which capture the inference problems in the original theory, but in a way that can be readily automated and is easier to deal with by existing (first-order) theorem provers than the standard translation. The principle of the axiomatic translation is conceptually very simple and can be almost completely automated. Soundness is automatic under reasonable assumptions, general decidability results can be stated and termination of ordered resolution is easily achieved. The non-trivial part of the approach is proving completeness. We prove results of completeness, decidability, model generation, the small model property and the interpolation property for a number of common and less common modal logics. We also present results of experiments with a number of first-order logic theorem provers which are very encouraging."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11499","fieldValue":"ACM"}
