However, the majority of existing methods suffer from one or more of the following limitations: (1) There is a lack of an automatic mechanism to formally discriminate between authoritative and nonauthoritative users. In fact, a common approach to authoritative user identification is to provide a ranked list of users expecting authorities to come first. A major problem of such an approach is the question of where to stop reading the ranked list of users. How many users should be chosen as authoritative&quest; (2) Supervised learning approaches for authoritative user identification suffer from their dependency on the training data. The problem here is that labeled samples are more difficult, expensive, and time consuming to obtain than unlabeled ones. (3) Several approaches rely on some user parameters to estimate an authority score. Detection accuracy of authoritative users can be seriously affected if incorrect values are used. In this article, we propose a parameterless mixture model-based approach that is capable of addressing the three aforementioned issues in a single framework. In our approach, we first represent each user with a feature vector composed of information related to its social behavior and activity in an online community. Next, we propose a statistical framework, based on the multivariate beta mixtures, in order to model the estimated set of feature vectors. The probability density function is therefore estimated and the beta component that corresponds to the most authoritative users is identified. The suitability of the proposed approach is illustrated on real data extracted from the Stack Exchange question-answering network and Twitter."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7628","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7628","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7629","fieldValue":" There has been much effort on studying how social media sites, such as Twitter, help propagate information in different situations, including spreading alerts and SOS messages in an emergency. However, existing work has not addressed how to actively identify and engage the right strangers at the right time on social media to help effectively propagate intended information within a desired time frame. To address this problem, we have developed three models: (1) a feature-based model that leverages people's exhibited social behavior, including the content of their tweets and social interactions, to characterize their willingness and readiness to propagate information on Twitter via the act of retweeting; (2) a wait-time model based on a user's previous retweeting wait times to predict his or her next retweeting time when asked; and (3) a subset selection model that automatically selects a subset of people from a set of available people using probabilities predicted by the feature-based model and maximizes retweeting rate. Based on these three models, we build a recommender system that predicts the likelihood of a stranger to retweet information when asked, within a specific time window, and recommends the top-N qualified strangers to engage with. Our experiments, including live studies in the real world, demonstrate the effectiveness of our work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7629","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7629","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7630","fieldValue":" Cloud computing offers a compelling vision of computation, enabling an unprecedented level of data distribution and sharing. Beyond improving the computing infrastructure, cloud computing enables a higher level of interoperability between information systems, simplifying tasks such as sharing documents between coworkers or enabling collaboration between an organization and its suppliers. While these abilities may result in significant benefits to users and organizations, they also present privacy challenges due to unwanted exposure of sensitive information. As information-sharing processes in cloud computing are complex and domain specific, configuring these processes can be an overwhelming and burdensome task for users. This article investigates the feasibility of configuring sharing processes through a small and representative set of canonical configuration options. For this purpose, we present a generic method, named SCON-UP (Simplified CON-figuration of User Preferences). SCON-UP simplifies configuration interfaces by using a clustering algorithm that analyzes a massive set of sharing preferences and condenses them into a small number of discrete disclosure levels. Thus, the user is provided with a usable configuration model while guaranteeing adequate privacy control. We describe the algorithm and empirically evaluate our model using data collected in two user studies (n &equals; 121 and n &equals; 352). Our results show that when provided with three canonical configuration options, on average, 82&percnt; of the population can be covered by at least one option. We exemplify the feasibility of discretizing sharing levels and discuss the tradeoff between coverage and simplicity in discrete configuration options."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7630","fieldValue":"ACM"}
