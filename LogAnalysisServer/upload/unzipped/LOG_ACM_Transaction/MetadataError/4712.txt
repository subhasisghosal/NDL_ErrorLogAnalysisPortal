The model of this simulator can efficiently tackle the problems in global optimal navigation, collision avoidance, and dynamic interaction; furthermore, it allows an agent to make independent decisions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25166","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25166","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25167","fieldValue":" In the planning of steady-state simulations, a central issue is the initial transient problem, in which an initial segment of the simulation output is adversely contaminated by initialization bias. Our article makes several contributions toward the analysis of this computational challenge. To begin, we introduce useful ways for measuring the magnitude of the initial transient effect in the single replication setting. We then analyze the marginal standard error rule (MSER) and prove that MSERâ\u20AC™s deletion point is determined, as the simulation time horizon tends to infinity, by the minimizer of a certain random walk. We use this insight, together with fluid limit intuition associated with queueing models, to generate two nonpathological examples in which at least one variant of MSER fails to accurately predict the duration of the initial transient. Our results suggest that the efficacy of a deletion procedure is sensitive to the choice of performance measure, and that the set of standard test problems on which initial transient procedures are tested should be significantly broadened."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25167","fieldValue":"MSER"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25168","fieldValue":" The application of queueing network models to real-world applications often involves the task of estimating the service demand placed by requests at queueing nodes. In this article, we propose a methodology to estimate service demands in closed multiclass queueing networks based on Gibbs sampling. Our methodology requires measurements of the number of jobs at resources and can accept prior probabilities on the demands. Gibbs sampling is challenging to apply to estimation problems for queueing networks since it requires one to efficiently evaluate a likelihood function on the measured data. This likelihood function depends on the equilibrium solution of the network, which is difficult to compute in closed models due to the presence of the normalizing constant of the equilibrium state probabilities. To tackle this obstacle, we define a novel iterative approximation of the normalizing constant and show the improved accuracy of this approach, compared to existing methods, for use in conjunction with Gibbs sampling. We also demonstrate that, as a demand estimation tool, Gibbs sampling outperforms other popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo approximations. Experimental validation based on traces from a cloud application demonstrates the effectiveness of Gibbs sampling for service demand estimation in real-world studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25168","fieldValue":"ACM"}
