The sheer volume of interesting photos makes it a challenge to explore this space. Various Web and social media sites, along with search and indexing techniques, have been developed in response. One natural way to navigate these images in a 3D geo-located context. In this article, we reflect on our work in this area, with a focus on techniques that build partial 3D scene models to help find and navigate interesting photographs in an interactive, immersive 3D setting. We also discuss how finding such relationships among photographs opens up exciting new possibilities for multimedia authoring, visualization, and editing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25530","fieldValue":" This article presents the idea of empathic stimulation that relies on the power and potential of unconsciously conveyed attentive and emotional information to facilitate human-machine interaction. Starting from a historical review of related work presented at past ACM Multimedia conferences, we discuss challenges that arise when exploiting unconscious human signals for empathic stimulation, such as the real-time analysis of psychological user states and the smooth adaptation of the human-machine interface based on this analysis. A classical application field that might benefit from the idea of unconscious human-computer interaction is the exploration of massive datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25531","fieldValue":" This article presents a personalized narrative on the early discussions within the Multimedia community and the subsequent research on experiential media systems.
