One of the greatest challenges in designing an online measurement module is to minimize the per-packet processing time in order to keep up with the line speed of the modern routers. To meet this challenge, we should minimize the number of memory accesses per packet and implement the measurement module in the on-die SRAM. The small size of SRAM requires extremely compact data structures to be designed for storing per-flow information. The best existing work, called counter braids, requires more than 4 bits per flow and performs six or more memory accesses per packet. In this paper, we design a fast and compact measurement function that estimates the sizes of all flows. It achieves the optimal processing speed: two memory accesses per packet. In addition, it provides reasonable measurement accuracy in a tight space where the counter braids no longer work. Our design is based on a new data encoding\/decoding scheme, called randomized counter sharing. This scheme allows us to mix per-flow information together in storage for compactness and, at the decoding time, separate the information of each flow through statistical removal of the error introduced during information mixing from other flows. The effectiveness of our online per-flow measurement approach is analyzed and confirmed through extensive experiments based on real network traffic traces. We also propose several methods to increase the estimation range of flow sizes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10399","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10399","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10399","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10400","fieldValue":" In 802.11 managed wireless networks, the manager can address underserved links by rate-limiting the conflicting nodes. In order to determine to what extent each conflicting node is responsible for the poor performance, the manager needs to understand the coordination among conflicting nodes' transmissions. In this paper, we present a management framework called Management, Inference, and Diagnostics using Activity Share (MIDAS). We introduce the concept of Activity Share, which characterizes the coordination among any set of network nodes in terms of the time they spend transmitting simultaneously. Unfortunately, the Activity Share cannot be locally measured by the nodes. Thus, MIDAS comprises an inference tool that, based on a combined physical, protocol, and statistical approach, infers the Activity Share by using a small set of passively collected, time-aggregate local channel measurements reported by the nodes. MIDAS uses the estimated Activity Share as the input of a simple model that predicts how limiting the transmission rate of any conflicting node would benefit the throughput of the underserved link. The model is based on the current network conditions, thus representing the first throughput model using online measurements. We implemented our tool on real hardware and deployed it on an indoor testbed. Our extensive validation combines testbed experiments and simulations. The results show that MIDAS infers the Activity Share with a mean relative error as low as 4% in testbed experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10400","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1946","fieldValue":"Jouppi, Norman P"}
