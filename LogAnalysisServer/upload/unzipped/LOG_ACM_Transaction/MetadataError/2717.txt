The matrix is accessed only through the evaluation of matrix-vector products. Working space of only a few n-vectors is required. The program implements a restarted block-Lanczos method. Judicious choices of acceleration polynomials make it possible to compute approximations of a few of the largest eigenvalues, a few of the smallest eigenvalues, or a few eigenvalues in the vicinity of a user-specified point on the real axis. irbleigs also can be applied to certain large generalized eigenproblems as well as to the computation of a few nearby singular values and associated right and left singular vectors of a large general matrix."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19055","fieldValue":"Algorithm 827: irbleigs: A MATLAB program for computing a few eigenpairs of a large sparse Hermitian matrix"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19055","fieldValue":"ACM"}
