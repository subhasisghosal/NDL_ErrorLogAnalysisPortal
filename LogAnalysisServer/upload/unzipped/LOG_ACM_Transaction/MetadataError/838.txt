{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2282","fieldValue":" This article examines two different mechanisms for saving power in battery-operated embedded systems. The first strategy is that the system can be placed in a sleep state if it is idle. However, a fixed amount of energy is required to bring the system back into an active state in which it can resume work. The second way in which power savings can be achieved is by varying the speed at which jobs are run. We utilize a power consumption curve P(s) which indicates the power consumption level given a particular speed. We assume that P(s) is convex, nondecreasing, and nonnegative for s â\u2030¥ 0. The problem is to schedule arriving jobs in a way that minimizes total energy use and so that each job is completed after its release time and before its deadline. We assume that all jobs can be preempted and resumed at no cost. Although each problem has been considered separately, this is the first theoretical analysis of systems that can use both mechanisms. We give an offline algorithm that is within a factor of 2 of the optimal algorithm. We also give an online algorithm with a constant competitive ratio."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2282","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2282","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13445","fieldValue":"Limbrick, Daniel B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13445","fieldValue":" As fabrication technology scales towards smaller transistor sizes and lower critical charge, single-event radiation effects are more likely to cause errant behavior in multiple, physically adjacent devices in modern integrated circuits (ICs), and with higher operating frequencies, this risk increasingly impacts design logic over memory as well. In order to increase future system reliability, circuit designers need greater awareness of multiple-transient charge-sharing effects during the early stages of their design flow with standard cell placement and routing. To measure the propagation and observability of multiple transients from single radiation events, this work uses several intra-pipeline combinational logic circuits at the 32nm technology node, investigates several different standard cell placements of each design, and analyzes those placements with a novel, physically realistic transient injection and simulation method. It is shown that (1) this simulation methodology, informed by experimental data, provides an increased realism over other works in traditional fault injection fields, (2) different placements of the same circuit where standard cells are grouped by logical hierarchy can result in different reliability behavior and benefits especially useful within the area of approximate computing, and (3) improved reliability through charge-sharing transient mitigation can be gained with no area penalty and minimal speed and power penalties by adjusting the placement of standard cells."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13445","fieldValue":"Single-Event Multiple-Transient Characterization and Mitigation via Alternative Standard Cell Placement Methods"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13445","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13445","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13446","fieldValue":" Scratchpad memories (SPMs) are widely employed in multicore embedded processors. Reliability is one of the major constraints in the embedded processor design, which is threatened with the increasing susceptibility of memory cells to multiple-bit upsets (MBUs) due to continuous technology down-scaling. This article proposes a low-cost and efficient data replication mechanism, called In-Scratchpad Memory Replication (ISMR), to correct MBUs in SPMs of multicore embedded processors. The main feature of ISMR is a smart controller, called Replication Management Unit (RMU), which is responsible for dynamically analyzing the activity of the SPM blocks at runtime and efficiently replicating the vulnerable SPM blocks into currently inactive SPM blocks. RMU exploits a 2-bit tag for each SPM block, where the value of each tag is determined by RMU according to the SPM access pattern. Accordingly, the proposed mechanism guarantees the replication of all vulnerable SPM blocks to provide error correction without decreasing the SPM utilization. To detect errors in SPM blocks, ISMR uses a 2-bit interleaved-parity code. As compared with the previous E-RAID 1 mechanism, the simulation results illustrate that for an 8-core embedded processor, the ISMR mechanism experiences 81&percnt; less energy consumption overhead and 48&percnt; less performance overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13446","fieldValue":"In-Scratchpad Memory Replication: Protecting Scratchpad Memories in Multicore Embedded Systems against Soft Errors"}
