While a large body of literature exists regarding modeling TCP performance for the wired Internet, and recently over a single-hop wireless link, the literature is very sparse on TCP analysis over a hybrid wired-wireless (multi-hop) path. We seek to make a contribution to this problem (where the wireless segment is a satellite uplink) by deriving analytical estimates of TCP throughput for two widely deployed approaches: TCP splitting and E2E (End-to-End) TCP with link layer support as a function of key parameters such as terrestrial\/satellite propagation delay, segment loss rate and buffer size. Our analysis is supported by simulations; throughput comparisons indicate superiority of TCP splitting over E2E scheme in most cases. However, in situations where end-to-end delay is dominated by terrestrial portion and buffering is very limited at intermediate node, E2E achieves higher throughput than TCP splitting."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9520","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9520","fieldValue":"TCP\/IP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9521","fieldValue":" Internet quality of service (QoS) is still a highly debated topic for more than fifteen years. Even with the large variety of QoS proposals and the impressive research advances, there is little deployment yet of network layer QoS technology. One specific problem domain is QoS signalling, which has recently attracted increasing attention to bring forward new standardization approaches. In this paper, an extensive study of RSVP is presented, covering protocol design, software design, and performance aspects of the basic version of RSVP and of certain standardized and experimental extensions. This work is based on and presents the experience from implementing RSVP for UNIX systems and the ns-2 simulation environment. The implementation includes a variety of protocol extensions and incorporates several internal improvements. It has been subject to extensive functional and performance evaluations, the results of which are reported here."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9521","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9521","fieldValue":"ACM"}
