Unfortunately, there are two main limitations in database processing that prevent a high degree of parallelism; these are the available I\/O bandwidth of the underlying storage devices and the concurrency control mechanisms necessary to guarantee data integrity. The main problem with conventional approaches is the lack of a computational model capable of utilizing the potential of any significant number of processing elements and storage devices and, at the same time, preserving the integrity of the database.This paper presents a database model and its associated architecture, which is based on the principles of data-driven computation. According to this model, the database is represented as a network in which each node is conceptually an independent, asynchronous processing element, capable of communicating with other nodes by exchanging messages along the network arcs. To answer a query, one or more such messages, called tokens, are created and injected into the network. These then propagate asynchronously through the network in search of results satisfying the given query.The asynchronous nature of processing permits the model to be mapped onto a computer architecture consisting of large numbers of independent disk units and processing elements. This increases both the available I\/O bandwidth as well as the processing potential of the machine. At the same time, new concurrency control and error recovery mechanisms are necessary to cope with the resulting parallelism."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14089","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14089","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14090","fieldValue":" The aim of an effective retrieval system is to yield high recall and precision (retrieval effectiveness). The nonbinary independence model, which takes into consideration the number of occurrences of terms in documents, is introduced. It is shown to be optimal under the assumption that terms are independent. It is verified by experiments to yield significant improvement over the binary independence model. The nonbinary model is extended to normalized vectors and is applicable to more general queries.Various ways to alleviate the consequences of the term independence assumption are discussed. Estimation of parameters required for the nonbinary independence model is provided, taking into consideration that a term may have different meanings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2332","fieldValue":" We present a simple algorithm which maintains the topological order of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with n nodes, under an online edge insertion sequence, in $O(n^2.75) time, independent of the number m of edges inserted. For dense DAGs, this is an improvement over the previous best result of O(min{m3\/2 log n, m3\/2 + n2$ log n}) by Katriel and Bodlaender [2006]. We also provide an empirical comparison of our algorithm with other algorithms for incremental topological sorting."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2332","fieldValue":"ACM"}
