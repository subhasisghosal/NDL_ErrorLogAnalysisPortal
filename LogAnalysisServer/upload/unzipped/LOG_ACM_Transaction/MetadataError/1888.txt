Given a set of points P and a collection of geometric shapes (or sets) F, we wish to find a minimum cardinality subset of F such that each point p âˆˆ P is covered by (contained in) at least d(p) sets. Here, d(p) is an integer demand (requirement) for p. When the demands d(p) = 1 for all p, this is the standard set cover problem. The set cover problem in geometric settings admits an approximation ratio that is better than that for the general version. In this article, we show that similar improvements can be obtained for the multicover problem as well. In particular, we obtain an O(log opt) approximation for set systems of bounded VC-dimension, and an O(1) approximation for covering points by half-spaces in three dimensions and for some other classes of shapes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2570","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2570","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16560","fieldValue":" This paper presents a novel facial animation retargeting system that is carefully designed to support the animator's workflow. Observation and analysis of the animators' often preferred process of key-frame animation with blendshape models informed our research. Our retargeting system generates a similar set of blendshape weights to those that would have been produced by an animator. This is achieved by rearranging the group of blendshapes into several sequential retargeting groups and solving using a matching pursuit-like scheme inspired by a traditional key-framing approach. Meanwhile, animators typically spend a tremendous amount of time simplifying the dense weight graphs created by the retargeting. Our graph simplification technique effectively produces editable weight graphs while preserving the visual characteristics of the original retargeting. Finally, we automatically create GUI controllers to help artists perform key-framing and editing very efficiently. The set of proposed techniques greatly reduce the time and effort required by animators to achieve high quality retargeted facial animations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16561","fieldValue":" In this paper, we investigate the impact of the deformable bodies on the control algorithms for physically simulated characters. We hypothesize that ignoring the effect of deformable bodies at the site of contact negatively affects the control algorithms, leading to less robust and unnatural character motions. To verify the hypothesis, we introduce a compact representation for an articulated character with deformable soft tissue and develop a practical system to simulate two-way coupling between rigid and deformable bodies in a robust and efficient manner. We then apply a few simple and widely used control algorithms, such as pose-space tracking control, Cartesian-space tracking control, and a biped controller (SIMBICON), to simulate a variety of behaviors for both full-body locomotion and hand manipulation. We conduct a series of experiments to compare our results with the motion generated by these algorithms on a character comprising only rigid bodies. The evaluation shows that the character with soft contact can withstand larger perturbations in a more noisy environment, as well as produce more realistic motion."}
