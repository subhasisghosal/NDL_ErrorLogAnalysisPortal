We characterize the relations among the throughput region of random multiple access, the capacity region of multiple access without code synchronization, and the stability region of ALOHA protocol. In the first part of the paper, we show that if the MPR channel is standard, the throughput region of random multiple access is coordinate convex. We then study the information capacity region of multiple access without code synchronization and feedback. Inner and outer bounds to the capacity region are derived. We show that both the inner and the outer bounds converge asymptotically to the throughput region. In the second part of the paper, we study the stability region of finite-terminal ALOHA multiple access. For a class of packet arrival distributions, we demonstrate that the stationary distribution of the queues possesses positive and strong positive correlation properties, which consequently yield an outer bound to the stability region. We also show the major challenge in obtaining the closure of the stability region is due to the lack of sensitivity analysis results with respect to the transmission probabilities. Particularly, if a conjectured \"sensitivity monotonicity\" property held for the stationary distribution of the queues, then equivalence between the closure of the stability region and the throughput region follows as a direct consequence, irrespective of the packet arrival distributions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9471","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9471","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9471","fieldValue":"ALOHA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9471","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9471","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9472","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of establishing minimum-cost multicast connections over coded packet networks, i.e., packet networks where the contents of outgoing packets are arbitrary, causal functions of the contents of received packets. We consider both wireline and wireless packet networks as well as both static multicast (where membership of the multicast group remains constant for the duration of the connection) and dynamic multicast (where membership of the multicast group changes in time, with nodes joining and leaving the group). For static multicast, we reduce the problem to a polynomial-time solvable optimization problem, and we present decentralized algorithms for solving it. These algorithms, when coupled with existing decentralized schemes for constructing network codes, yield a fully decentralized approach for achieving minimum-cost multicast. By contrast, establishing minimum-cost static multicast connections over routed packet networks is a very difficult problem even using centralized computation, except in the special cases of unicast and broadcast connections. For dynamic multicast, we reduce the problem to a dynamic programming problem and apply the theory of dynamic programming to suggest how it may be solved."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9472","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9472","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}
