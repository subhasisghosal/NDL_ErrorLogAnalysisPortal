{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22669","fieldValue":" Advancements in network technology have led to the emergence of new computing paradigms that challenge established programming practices by employing weak forms of consistency and dynamic forms of binding. Code mobility, for instance, allows for invocation-time binding between a code fragment and the location where it executes. Similarly, mobile computing allows hosts (and the software they execute) to alter their physical location. Despite apparent similarities, the two paradigms are distinct in their treatment of location and movement. This paper seeks to uncover a common foundation for the two paradigms by exploring the manner in which stereotypical forms of code mobility can be expressed in a programming notation developed for mobile computing. Several solutions to a distributed simulation problem are used to illustrate the modeling strategy and the ability to construct assertional-style proofs for programs that employ code mobility."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22669","fieldValue":"UNITY"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22669","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22669","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3211","fieldValue":"Robles-De-La-Torre, G."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3211","fieldValue":" Precise manipulation of objects is ordinarily limited by visual, kinesthetic, motor, and cognitive factors. Specially designed virtual objects and tasks minimize such limitations, making it possible to isolate and estimate the internal model that guides subjects' performance. Subjects manipulated a computer-generated virtual object (vO), attempting to align vO to a target whose position changed randomly every 10 s. To analyze the control actions subjects use while manipulating the vO, we benchmarked human performance against that of ideal performers (IPs), behavioral counterparts to ideal observers used in sensory research. These comparisons showed that subjects performed as feed-forward, predictive controllers. Simulations with degraded-IPs suggest that human asymptotic performance was not limited by imprecisions of vision or of motor timing, but resulted mainly from inaccuracies in the internal models of vO dynamics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3211","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3211","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22670","fieldValue":"Beauvais, J-R"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22670","fieldValue":"Le Guernic, P."}
