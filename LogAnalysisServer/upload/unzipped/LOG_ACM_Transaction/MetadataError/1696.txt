We propose a joint-aware deformation framework that supports the direct manipulation of an arbitrary mix of rigid and deformable components. First we apply slippable motion analysis to automatically detect multiple types of joint constraints that are implicit in model geometry. For single-component geometry or models with disconnected components, we support user-defined virtual joints. Then we integrate manipulation handle constraints, multiple components, joint constraints, joint limits, and deformation energies into a single volumetric-cell-based space deformation problem. An iterative, parallelized Gauss-Newton solver is used to solve the resulting nonlinear optimization. Interactive deformable manipulation is demonstrated on a variety of geometric models while automatically respecting their multi-component nature and the natural behavior of their joints."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16073","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16073","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2524","fieldValue":" In computational phylogenetics, the problem of constructing a consensus tree for a given set of rooted input trees has frequently been addressed. In this article we study the Minimum-Flip Problem: the input trees are transformed into a binary matrix, and we want to find a perfect phylogeny for this matrix using a minimum number of flips, that is, corrections of single entries in the matrix. The graph-theoretical formulation of the problem is as follows: Given a bipartite graph G = (Vt âˆª Vc, E), the task is to find a minimum set of edge modifications such that the resulting graph has no induced path with four edges that starts and ends in Vt, where Vt corresponds to the taxa set and Vc corresponds to the character set. We present two fixed-parameter algorithms for the Minimum-Flip Problem, one with running time O(4.83k + poly(m, n)) and another one with running time O(4.42k + poly(m, n)) for n taxa, m characters, k flips, and poly(m, n) denotes a polynomial function in m and n. Additionally, we discuss several heuristic improvements. We also report computational results on phylogenetic data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2524","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2524","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16074","fieldValue":" Transferring existing mesh deformation from one character to another is a simple way to accelerate the laborious process of mesh animation. In many cases, it is useful to preserve the semantic characteristics of the motion instead of its literal deformation. For example, when applying the walking motion of a human to a flamingo, the knees should bend in the opposite direction. Semantic deformation transfer accomplishes this task with a shape space that enables interpolation and projection with standard linear algebra. Given several example mesh pairs, semantic deformation transfer infers a correspondence between the shape spaces of the two characters. This enables automatic transfer of new poses and animations."}
