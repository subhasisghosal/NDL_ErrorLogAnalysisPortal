{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3230","fieldValue":" Communication plays a central role in everday life. During an average conversation, information is exchanged in a variety of ways, including through facial motion. Here, we employ a custom, model-based image manipulation technique to selectively â\u20ACœfreez â\u20AC? portions of a face in video recordings in order to determine the areas that are sufficient for proper recognition of nine conversational expressions. The results show that most expressions rely primarily on a single facial area to convey meaning with different expressions using different areas. The results also show that the combination of rigid head, eye, eyebrow, and mouth motions is sufficient to produce expressions that are as easy to recognize as the original, unmanipulated recordings. Finally, the results show that the manipulation technique introduced few perceptible artifacts into the altered video sequences. This fusion of psychophysics and computer graphics techniques provides not only fundamental insights into human perception and cognition, but also yields the basis for a systematic description of what needs to move in order to produce realistic, recognizable conversational facial animations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22845","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22845","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22847","fieldValue":"Andr, tienne"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22847","fieldValue":" Modeling and verifying complex real-time systems are challenging research problems. The de facto approach is based on Timed Automata, which are finite state automata equipped with clock variables. Timed Automata are deficient in modeling hierarchical complex systems. In this work, we propose a language called Stateful Timed CSP and an automated approach for verifying Stateful Timed CSP models. Stateful Timed CSP is based on Timed CSP and is capable of specifying hierarchical real-time systems. Through dynamic zone abstraction, finite-state zone graphs can be generated automatically from Stateful Timed CSP models, which are subject to model checking. Like Timed Automata, Stateful Timed CSP models suffer from Zeno runs, that is, system runs that take infinitely many steps within finite time. Unlike Timed Automata, model checking with non-Zenoness in Stateful Timed CSP can be achieved based on the zone graphs. We extend the PAT model checker to support system modeling and verification using Stateful Timed CSP and show its usability\/scalability via verification of real-world systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22847","fieldValue":"PAT"}
