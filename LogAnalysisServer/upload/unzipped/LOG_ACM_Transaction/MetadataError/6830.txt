To address the issue of protecting organizationsâ\u20AC™ competitive knowledge and private information while also enabling business-to-business (B2B) collaboration, past research has focused mainly on customized public and private process design, as well as structural correctness of the integrated workflow. However, a dataflow perspective is important for business process integration. This article presents a data-flow perspective using workflow management and mathematical techniques to address data exchange problems in independent multistakeholder business process integration in dynamic circumstances. The research is conducted following a design science paradigm. We build artifacts that include interorganizational workflow concepts, a workflow model, and a public dataset calculation method. The use of the proposed artifacts is illustrated by applying them to a real-world case in the Shenzhen (Chaiwan) port. The utility of the artifacts is evaluated through interviews with practitioners in industry. We conclude that this research complements the control-flow perspective in the interorganizational workflow management area and also contributes to B2B information-sharing literature; further, the dataflow formalism can help practitioners to formally provide the right data at the right time in dynamic circumstances."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8218","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8218","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8219","fieldValue":"Tan, Yao-Hua"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8219","fieldValue":" In business environments, different sorts of regulations are imposed to restrict the behavior of both public and private organizations, ranging from legal regulations to internal policies. Regulatory compliance is important for the safety of individual actors as well as the overall business environment. However, complexity derives from not only the contents of the regulations but also their interdependencies. As such, the verification of whether actors are able to comply with the combined regulations cannot be done by checking each regulation separately. To these ends, we introduce a normative structure Norm Nets (NNs) for modeling sets of interrelated regulations and setting a basis for compliance checking of organizational interactions against interrelated regulations. NNs support a modular design by providing the constructs to represent regulations and the relationships between them. Additionally, we propose a computational mechanism to reason about regulatory compliance by mapping NNs to Colored Petri Nets (CPNs). We show that compliance checking of both individual actorsâ\u20AC™ behavior and the collective behavior of the business environment can be achieved automatically using state space analysis techniques of CPNs. The approach is illustrated with a case study from the domain of international trade."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8219","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8219","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1742","fieldValue":" Advances in deep submicron technology call for a careful review of existing cache designs and design practices in terms of yield, area, and performance. This article presents a Design and Evaluation Framework for defect-tolerant Cache Memories (DEFCAM), which enables processor architects to consider yield, area, and performance together in a unified framework. Since there is a complex, changing trade-off among these metrics depending on the technology, the cache organization, and the yield enhancement scheme employed, such a design flow is invaluable to processor architects when they assess a design and explore the design space quickly at an early stage. We develop a complete framework supporting the proposed DEFCAM design flow, from injecting defects into a wafer to evaluating program performance of individual processors on the wafer. Using DEFCAM, interesting interactions between architectural, organizational, and layout\/defect related parameters can be easily evaluated. Moreover, we propose practical set remapping schemes to contain hard faults in cache memory. In a set remapping scheme, accesses that would go to an unusable faulty set are directed to a sound set. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design flow and developed tools. Experimental results show that a set remapping is the most efficient fault covering method among prevailing strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1742","fieldValue":"ACM"}
