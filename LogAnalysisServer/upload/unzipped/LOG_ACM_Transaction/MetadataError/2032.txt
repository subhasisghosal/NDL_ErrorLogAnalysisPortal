However, problems such as texture seams, normal recomputation, and undersampling artifacts have limited its adoption. We provide a comprehensive solution to these problems by introducing a smooth analytic displacement function. Coefficients are stored in a GPU-friendly tile-based texture format, and a multiresolution mip hierarchy of this function is formed. We propose a novel level-of-detail scheme by computing per-vertex adaptive tessellation factors and select the appropriate prefiltered mip levels of the displacement function. Our method obviates the need for a precomputed normal map since normals are directly derived from the displacements. Thus, we are able to perform authoring and rendering simultaneously without typical displacement map extraction from a dense triangle mesh. This not only is more flexible than the traditional combination of discrete displacements and normal maps, but also provides faster runtime due to reduced memory I\/O."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16933","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16933","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16933","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16934","fieldValue":" We have developed a novel hierarchical data structure for the efficient representation of sparse, time-varying volumetric data discretized on a 3D grid. Our â\u20ACœVDBâ\u20AC?, so named because it is a Volumetric, Dynamic grid that shares several characteristics with B&plus;trees, exploits spatial coherency of time-varying data to separately and compactly encode data values and grid topology. VDB models a virtually infinite 3D index space that allows for cache-coherent and fast data access into sparse volumes of high resolution. It imposes no topology restrictions on the sparsity of the volumetric data, and it supports fast (average O(1)) random access patterns when the data are inserted, retrieved, or deleted. This is in contrast to most existing sparse volumetric data structures, which assume either static or manifold topology and require specific data access patterns to compensate for slow random access. Since the VDB data structure is fundamentally hierarchical, it also facilitates adaptive grid sampling, and the inherent acceleration structure leads to fast algorithms that are well-suited for simulations. As such, VDB has proven useful for several applications that call for large, sparse, animated volumes, for example, level set dynamics and cloud modeling. In this article, we showcase some of these algorithms and compare VDB with existing, state-of-the-art data structures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16935","fieldValue":"OBrien, James F."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16935","fieldValue":" We describe a geometric technique to detect physically inconsistent arrangements of shadows in an image. This technique combines multiple constraints from cast and attached shadows to constrain the projected location of a point light source. The consistency of the shadows is posed as a linear programming problem. A feasible solution indicates that the collection of shadows is physically plausible, while a failure to find a solution provides evidence of photo tampering."}
