Simultaneously the computation capabilities required in these fields are constantly increasing for afford the implementation of different kind of applications ranging from signal processing to networking. SRAM-based FPGAs are the candidate devices to achieve this goal thanks to their high versatility of implementing complex circuits with a very short development time. However, in critical environments, the presence of Single Event Upsets (SEUs) affecting the FPGAâ\u20AC™s functionalities, requires the adoption of specific fault tolerant techniques, like Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), able to increase the protection capability against radiation effects, but on the other side, introducing a dramatic penalty in terms of performances. In this paper, it is proposed a new timing-driven placement algorithm for implementing soft-errors resilient circuits on SRAM-based FPGAs with a negligible degradation of performance. The algorithm is based on a placement heuristic able to remove the crossing error domains while decreasing the routing congestions and delay inserted by the TMR routing and voting scheme. Experimental analysis performed by timing analysis and SEU static analysis point out a performance improvement of 29&percnt; on the average with respect to standard TMR approach and an increased robustness against SEU affecting the FPGAâ\u20AC™s configuration memory. Accurate analyses of SEUs sensitivity and performance optimization have been performed on a real microprocessor core demonstrating an improvement of performances of more than 62&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21769","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21769","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21769","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21770","fieldValue":" This article presents a novel configuration scrubbing core, used for internal detection and correction of radiation-induced configuration single and multiple bit errors, without requiring external scrubbing. The proposed technique combines the benefits of fast radiation-induced fault detection with fast restoration of the device functionality and small area and power overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel approach significantly improves the availability in hostile radiation environments of FPGA-based designs. When implemented using a Xilinx XC2V1000 Virtex-II device, the presented technique detects and corrects single bit upsets and double, triple and quadruple multi bit upsets, occupying just 1488 slices and dissipating less than 30 mW at a 50MHz running frequency."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21770","fieldValue":"Exploiting Self-Reconfiguration Capability to Improve SRAM-based FPGA Robustness in Space and Avionics Applications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21770","fieldValue":"ACM"}
