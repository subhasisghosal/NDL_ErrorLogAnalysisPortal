Our method can reduce their dependence on corrective eyewear. It also benefits individuals with normal vision by improving visual acuity at a distance and of small details. Our approach does not require custom hardware. Instead, the calculated images can be shown on a standard computer display, on printed paper, or superimposed on a physical scene using a projector. Our technique uses a constrained total variation method to produce a deconvolution result which, upon observation, appears sharp at the edges. We introduce a novel relative total variation term that enables controlling ringing reduction, contrast gain, and sharpness. The end result is the ability to generate sharper appearing images, even for individuals with refractive vision problems including myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and astigmatism. Our approach has been validated in simulation, in camera-screen experiments, and in a study with human observers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17277","fieldValue":"Ben-Chen, Mirela"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17277","fieldValue":" Vector fields on surfaces are fundamental in various applications in computer graphics and geometry processing. In many cases, in addition to representing vector fields, the need arises to compute their derivatives, for example, for solving partial differential equations on surfaces or for designing vector fields with prescribed smoothness properties. In this work, we consider the problem of computing the Levi-Civita covariant derivative, that is, the tangential component of the standard directional derivative, on triangle meshes. This problem is challenging since, formally, tangent vector fields on polygonal meshes are often viewed as being discontinuous, hence it is not obvious what a good derivative formulation would be. We leverage the relationship between the Levi-Civita covariant derivative of a vector field and the directional derivative of its component functions to provide a simple, easy-to-implement discretization for which we demonstrate experimental convergence. In addition, we introduce two linear which provide access to additional constructs in Riemannian geometry that are not easy to discretize otherwise, including the parallel transport operator which can be seen simply as a certain matrix exponential. Finally, we show the applicability of our operator to various tasks, such as fluid simulation on curved surfaces and vector field design, by posing algebraic constraints on the covariant derivative operator."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17277","fieldValue":"ACM"}
