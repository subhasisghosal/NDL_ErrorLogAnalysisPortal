In this article, a comprehensive overview of techniques related to the pipeline from 3D sensing to printing is provided. We compare the latest 3D sensors and 3D printers and introduce several sensing, postprocessing, and printing techniques available from both commercial deployments and published research. In addition, we demonstrate several devices, software, and experimental results of our related projects to further elaborate details of this process. A case study is conducted to further illustrate the possible tradeoffs during the process of this pipeline. Current progress, future research trends, and potential risks of 3D technologies are also discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25725","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25725","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25726","fieldValue":"De Turck, Filip"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25726","fieldValue":" HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is quickly becoming the de facto standard for video streaming services. In HAS, each video is temporally segmented and stored in different quality levels. Rate adaptation heuristics, deployed at the video player, allow the most appropriate level to be dynamically requested, based on the current network conditions. It has been shown that todayâ\u20AC™s heuristics underperform when multiple clients consume video at the same time, due to fairness issues among clients. Concretely, this means that different clients negatively influence each other as they compete for shared network resources. In this article, we propose a novel rate adaptation algorithm called FINEAS (Fair In-Network Enhanced Adaptive Streaming), capable of increasing clientsâ\u20AC™ Quality of Experience (QoE) and achieving fairness in a multiclient setting. A key element of this approach is an in-network system of coordination proxies in charge of facilitating fair resource sharing among clients. The strength of this approach is threefold. First, fairness is achieved without explicit communication among clients and thus no significant overhead is introduced into the network. Second, the system of coordination proxies is transparent to the clients, that is, the clients do not need to be aware of its presence. Third, the HAS principle is maintained, as the in-network components only provide the clients with new information and suggestions, while the rate adaptation decision remains the sole responsibility of the clients themselves. We evaluate this novel approach through simulations, under highly variable bandwidth conditions and in several multiclient scenarios. We show how the proposed approach can improve fairness up to 80&percnt; compared to state-of-the-art HAS heuristics in a scenario with three networks, each containing 30 clients streaming video at the same time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25726","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25726","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25727","fieldValue":" In content-based visual object retrieval, image representation is one of the fundamental issues in improving retrieval performance. Existing works adopt either local SIFT-like features or holistic features, and may suffer sensitivity to noise or poor discrimination power. In this article, we propose a compact representation for scalable object retrieval from few generic object regions. The regions are identified with a general object detector and are described with a fusion of learning-based features and aggregated SIFT features. Further, we compress feature representation in large-scale image retrieval scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two public ground-truth datasets, with promising results. Experimental results on a million-scale image database demonstrate superior retrieval accuracy with efficiency gain in both computation and memory usage."}
