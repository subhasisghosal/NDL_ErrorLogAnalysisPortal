In this algorithm, each node updates its own location estimate using the pairwise distance measurements and the local information it receives from the neighboring nodes. Once the location estimate is updated, the sensor node broadcasts the updated estimate to all the neighboring nodes. A distributed and scalable local scheduling algorithm for updating nodes in the network is presented to avoid the use of the global coordinator or a routing loop. We analytically show that the proposed distributed algorithm converges under certain practical assumptions of the network. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using both simulation and experimental results. Quantitative comparisons among different distributed algorithms are also presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21296","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21296","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21297","fieldValue":" Broadcast authentication is an important functionality in sensor networks. Energy constraints on sensor nodes and the real-time nature of the broadcasts render many of the existing solutions impractical: previous works focusing primarily on symmetric key schemes have difficulties in achieving real-time authentication. Public Key Cryptography (PKC), however, can satisfy the real-time requirements, and recent trends indicate that public key is becoming feasible for sensor networks. However, PKC operations are still expensive computations. It is impractical to use PKC in the conventional ways for broadcast authentication in sensor networks. To reduce costs, we propose ShortPK, an efficient Short-term Public Key broadcast authentication scheme. The basic idea is to use short-length public\/private keys, but limit their lifetime to only a short period of time. To cover a long period of time, we need to use many public\/private key pairs; distributing these public keys to sensors is a challenging problem. We describe a progressive key distribution scheme that is secure, efficient, and packet-loss resilient. We compare our scheme with the traditional 160-bit ECC public key schemes, and show that our scheme can achieve a significant improvement on energy consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21297","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21297","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3030","fieldValue":" The Chinese and Japanese languages share Chinese characters. Since the Chinese characters in Japanese originated from ancient China, many common Chinese characters exist between these two languages. Since Chinese characters contain significant semantic information and common Chinese characters share the same meaning in the two languages, they can be quite useful in Chinese-Japanese machine translation (MT). We therefore propose a method for creating a Chinese character mapping table for Japanese, traditional Chinese, and simplified Chinese, with the aim of constructing a complete resource of common Chinese characters. Furthermore, we point out two main problems in Chinese word segmentation for Chinese-Japanese MT, namely, unknown words and word segmentation granularity, and propose an approach exploiting common Chinese characters to solve these problems. We also propose a statistical method for detecting other semantically equivalent Chinese characters other than the common ones and a method for exploiting shared Chinese characters in phrase alignment. Results of the experiments carried out on a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT system and an example-based MT system show that our proposed approaches can improve MT performance significantly, thereby verifying the effectiveness of shared Chinese characters for Chinese-Japanese MT."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21298","fieldValue":"Rao, Nageswara S V"}
