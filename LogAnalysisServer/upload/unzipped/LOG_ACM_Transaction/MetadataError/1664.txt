In this paper we describe skinning templates, which define common deformation behaviors for common joint types. This abstraction allows skinning solutions to be shared and reused, and they allow a user to quickly explore many possible alternatives for the skinning behavior of a character. The skinning templates are implemented using cage-based deformations, which offer a flexible design space within which to develop reusable skinning behaviors. We demonstrate the interactive use of skinning templates to quickly explore alternate skinning behaviors for 3D models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15991","fieldValue":" In late 2006, Nintendo released a new game controller, the Wiimote, which included a three-axis accelerometer. Since then, a large variety of novel applications for these controllers have been developed by both independent and commercial developers. We add to this growing library with three performance interfaces that allow the user to control the motion of a dynamically simulated, animated character through the motion of his or her arms, wrists, or legs. For comparison, we also implement a traditional joystick\/button interface. We assess these interfaces by having users test them on a set of tracks containing turns and pits. Two of the interfaces (legs and wrists) were judged to be more immersive and were better liked than the joystick\/button interface by our subjects. All three of the Wiimote interfaces provided better control than the joystick interface based on an analysis of the failures seen during the user study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15992","fieldValue":"Goldman, Dan B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15992","fieldValue":" We present a video-based interface that allows users of all skill levels to quickly create cutout-style animations by performing the character motions. The puppeteer first creates a cast of physical puppets using paper, markers and scissors. He then physically moves these puppets to tell a story. Using an inexpensive overhead camera our system tracks the motions of the puppets and renders them on a new background while removing the puppeteer's hands. Our system runs in real-time (at 30 fps) so that the puppeteer and the audience can immediately see the animation that is created. Our system also supports a variety of constraints and effects including articulated characters, multi-track animation, scene changes, camera controls, 2 1\/2-D environments, shadows, and animation cycles. Users have evaluated our system both quantitatively and qualitatively: In tests of low-level dexterity, our system has similar accuracy to a mouse interface. For simple story telling, users prefer our system over either a mouse interface or traditional puppetry. We demonstrate that even first-time users, including an eleven-year-old, can use our system to quickly turn an original story idea into an animation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15992","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15992","fieldValue":"ACM"}
