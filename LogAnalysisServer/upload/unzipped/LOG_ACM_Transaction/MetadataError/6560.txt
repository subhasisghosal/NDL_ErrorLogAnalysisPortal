The key insight behind the process is that it is possible to spot likely translation errors with only monolingual knowledge of the target language, and it is possible to generate alternative ways to say the same thing (i.e., paraphrases) with only monolingual knowledge of the source language. Formal evaluation demonstrates that this approach can yield substantial improvements in translation quality, and the idea has been integrated into a broader framework for monolingual collaborative translation that produces fully accurate, fully fluent translations for a majority of sentences in a real-world translation task, with no involvement of human bilingual speakers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7480","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7480","fieldValue":"ACM"}
