{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6664","fieldValue":" One of the main advantages of high-level synthesis (HLS) is the ability to synthesize circuits that can access multiple memory banks in parallel. Current HLS systems synthesize parallel memory references based on explicit array declarations in the source code. We consider the need to synthesize not only array references but also memory operations targeting pointers and dynamic data structures. This paper describes Automatic Memory Partitioning, a method for automatically synthesizing general data structures (arrays and pointers) into multiple memory banks for increased parallelism and performance. We use source code instrumentation to collect memory traces in order to detect linear memory access patterns. The memory traces are used to split data structures into disjoint memory regions and determine which segments may benefit from parallel memory access. We present an algorithm for allocating memory segments into multiple memory banks. Experiments show significant improvements in performance while conserving the number of memory banks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/6664","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442116.2442118\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6664","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6664","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6665","fieldValue":" This article establishes a novel analytical approach to quantify robustness of scheduling and battery management for battery supported cyber-physical systems. A dynamic schedulability test is introduced to determine whether tasks are schedulable within a finite time window. The test is used to measure robustness of a real-time scheduling algorithm by evaluating the strength of computing time perturbations that break schedulability at runtime. Robustness of battery management is quantified analytically by an adaptive threshold on the state of charge. The adaptive threshold significantly reduces the false alarm rate for battery management algorithms to decide when a battery needs to be replaced."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/6665","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442116.2442119\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6665","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6665","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6666","fieldValue":"Putzke-Rming, Wolfram"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6666","fieldValue":" Recently, system designers are facing the challenge of developing systems that have diverse features, are more complex and more powerful, with less power consumption and reduced time to market. These contradictory constraints have forced technology providers to pursue design solutions that will allow design teams to meet the above design targets. In that respect, this paper introduces an innovative technology platform, called MORPHEUS, which intents to provide complete design framework for dealing with the aforementioned challenges. MORPHEUS consists of a state of the art architecture that encompasses heterogeneous reconfigurable accelerators for implementing on the same hardware architecture applications with varying characteristics and a tool chain that, through a software oriented approach, eases the implementation of highly complex applications with heterogeneous characteristics. The proposed approach has been tested and evaluated through state of the art cases studies borrowed from complementary application domains."}
