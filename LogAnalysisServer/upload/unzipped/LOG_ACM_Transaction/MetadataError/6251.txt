However, existing verification techniques are mostly ad-hoc and non-systematic. In this article, we present a systematic, comprehensive, and formally founded co-verification framework for digital HW\/SW systems that are modeled in SystemC. The framework is based on a formal semantics of SystemC and uses a combination of model checking and testing, whereby testing includes both the automated generation of timed inputs and automated conformance evaluation. We demonstrate its performance and its error detecting capability with two case studies, namely a packet switch and an anti-slip regulation and anti-lock braking system."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/6657","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2435227.2435257\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6657","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6657","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6658","fieldValue":"Chung, Tae-Sun"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6658","fieldValue":" Flash memory offers attractive features, such as non-volatile, shock resistance, fast access and low power consumption for data storage. However, it has one main drawback of requiring an erase before updating the contents. Furthermore, the flash memory can only be erased for a limited number of times. These characteristics are controlled by a software layer called the flash translation layer (FTL). FTL efficiently manages read, write, and erase operations to enhance the overall performance, and considers wear-leveling to prolong the durability of flash memory. In this article, we identify the logical sector numbers corresponding to random data, termed as hot-LSNs, and distribute them to all available blocks without degrading the performance of the flash memory. From our evaluation, we found that the extra erase operations for distributing the hot-LSNs are very low compared to the overall performance. Even though Hot-LSNs Distributing Wear-Leveling Algorithm (Hot-DL) incorporates wear-leveling in the performance enhancing algorithm, Hot-DL only requires approximately 0.015&percnt; of extra erase operations compared to previous well-optimized performance enhancing algorithms, shared buffer scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/6658","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2435227.2435258\"}"}
