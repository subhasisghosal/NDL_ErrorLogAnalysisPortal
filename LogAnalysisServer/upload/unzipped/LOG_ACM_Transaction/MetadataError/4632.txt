Equivalently, SRFPs seek locations where an unknown vector function attains a given target using only a simulation capable of providing estimates of the function. SRFPs find application in a wide variety of physical settings. We develop a family of retrospective-approximation (RA) algorithms called Bounding RA that efficiently solves a certain class of multidimensional SRFPs. During each iteration, Bounding RA generates and solves a sample-path problem by identifying a polytope of stipulated diameter, with an image that bounds the given target to within stipulated tolerance. Across iterations, the stipulations become increasingly stringent, resulting in a sequence of shrinking polytopes that approach the correct solution. Efficiency results from: (i) the RA structure, (ii) the idea of using bounding polytopes to exploit problem structure, and (iii) careful step-size and direction choice during algorithm evolution. Bounding RA has good finite-time performance that is robust with respect to the location of the initial solution, and algorithm parameter values. Empirical tests suggest that Bounding RA outperforms Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), which is arguably the best-known algorithm for solving SRFPs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24973","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24973","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24974","fieldValue":" A stochastic discrete-event simulation model of the natural history of Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is augmented with screening technology representations to create a base for simulating various screening strategies for CRC. The CRC screening strategies recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and the newest screening strategies for which clinical efficacy has been established are simulated. In addition to verification steps, validation of screening is pursued by comparison with the Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study. The model accumulates discounted costs and quality-adjusted life-years. The natural variability in the modeled random variables for natural history is conditioned using a probabilistic sensitivity analysis through a two-stage sampling process that adds other random variables representing parametric uncertainty. The analysis of the screening alternatives in a low-risk population explores both deterministic and stochastic dominance to eliminate some screening alternatives. Net benefit analysis, based on willingness to pay for quality-adjusted life-years, is used to compare the most cost-effective strategies through acceptability curves and to make a screening recommendation. Methodologically, this work demonstrates how variability from the natural variation in the development, screening, and treatment of a disease can be combined with the variation in parameter uncertainty. Furthermore, a net benefit analysis that characterizes cost-effectiveness alternatives can explicitly depend on variation from all sources producing a probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis of decision alternatives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24974","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24974","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24975","fieldValue":" Analysts examining complex simulation models often conduct screening experiments to identify important factors. The controlled sequential bifurcation screening procedures CSB and CSB-X use a sequence of tests to classify factors as important or unimportant, while controlling Type I error and power. These procedures require analysts to identify the directions of the effects prior to experimentation, which can be problematic. We propose hybrid two-phase approaches, FFCSB and FFCSBX, as alternatives. Phase 1 uses an efficient fractional factorial to estimate factor effect directions; phase 2 uses CSB or CSB-X. Empirical investigations show these outperform CSB(X) in efficiency and effectiveness for many situations of practical interest."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24975","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24975","fieldValue":"ACM"}
