In this work, we investigate the relevance feedback problem for interactive intelligent 3D object retrieval, with the focus on studying effective machine learning algorithms for improving the user's interaction in the retrieval task. One of the key challenges is to learn appropriate kernel similarity measure between 3D objects through the relevance feedback interaction with users. We address this challenge by presenting a novel framework of Active multiple kernel learning (AMKL), which exploits multiple kernel learning techniques for relevance feedback in interactive 3D object retrieval. The proposed framework aims to efficiently identify an optimal combination of multiple kernels by asking the users to label the most informative 3D images. We evaluate the proposed techniques on a dataset of over 10,000 3D models collected from the World Wide Web. Our experimental results show that the proposed AMKL technique is significantly more effective for 3D object retrieval than the regular relevance feedback techniques widely used in interactive content-based image retrieval, and thus is promising for enhancing user's interaction in such interactive intelligent retrieval systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7122","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7122","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/1060","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"February 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1101\",\"title\":\"Issue 4(Special Section on Best Papers from SEAMS 2014 and Regular Articles), February 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"December 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1100\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, December 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"October 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1099\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, October 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"June 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1098\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, June 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"March 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1097\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, March 2015\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1649","fieldValue":"Peh, Li-Shiuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1649","fieldValue":" Interconnection networks have been deployed as the communication fabric in a wide spectrum of parallel computer systems, ranging from chip multiprocessors (CMPs) and embedded multicore systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) to clusters and server blades. Recent technology trends have permitted a rapid growth of chip resources, faster clock rates, and wider communication bandwidths, however, these trends have also led to an increase in power consumption that is becoming a key limiting factor in the design of such scalable interconnected systems. Power-aware networks, therefore, need to become inherent components of single and multi-chip parallel systems. In the hardware arena, recent interconnection network power-management research work has employed limited-scope techniques that mostly focus on reducing the power consumed by the network communication links. As these limited-scope techniques are not tailored to the applications running on the network, power savings and the corresponding impact on network latency vary significantly from one application to the next as we demonstrate in this paper; in many cases, network performance can severely suffer. In the software arena, extensive research on compile-time optimizations has produced parallelizing compilers that can efficiently map an application onto hardware for high performance. However, research into power-aware parallelizing compilers is in its infancy. In this paper, we take the first steps toward tailoring applications' communication needs at run-time for low power. We propose software techniques that extend the flow of a parallelizing compiler in order to direct run-time network power reduction. We target network links, a significant power consumer in these systems, allowing dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) instructions extracted during static compilation to orchestrate link voltage and frequency transitions for power savings during application run-time. Concurrently, an online hardware mechanism measures network congestion levels and adapts these off-line DVS settings to maximize network performance. Our simulations over three existing parallel systems, ranging from very fine-grained single-chip to coarse-grained multi-chip architectures, show that link power consumption can be reduced by up to 76.3&percnt;, with a minor increase in latency, ranging from 0.18 to 6.78&percnt; across a number of benchmark suites."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1649","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1649","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7123","fieldValue":" Sketch recognition attempts to interpret the hand-sketched markings made by users on an electronic medium. Through recognition, sketches and diagrams can be interpreted and sent to simulators or other meaningful analyzers. Primitives are the basic building block shapes used by high-level visual grammars to describe the symbols of a given sketch domain. However, one limitation of these primitive recognizers is that they often only support basic shapes drawn with a single stroke. Furthermore, recognizers that do support multistroke primitives place additional constraints on users, such as temporal timeouts or modal button presses to signal shape completion. The goal of this research is twofold. First, we wanted to determine the drawing habits of most users. Our studies found multistroke primitives to be more prevalent than multiple primitives drawn in a single stroke. Additionally, our studies confirmed that threading is less frequent when there are more sides to a figure. Next, we developed an algorithm that is capable of recognizing multistroke primitives without requiring special drawing constraints. The algorithm uses a graph-building and search technique that takes advantage of Tarjan's linear search algorithm, along with principles to determine the goodness of a fit. Our novel, constraint-free recognizer achieves accuracy rates of 96&percnt; on freely-drawn primitives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7123","fieldValue":"ACM"}
