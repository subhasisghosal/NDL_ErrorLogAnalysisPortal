{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15423","fieldValue":" Lighting models used in the production of computer generated feature animation have to be flexible, easy to control, and efficient to compute. Global illumination techniques do not lend themselves easily to flexibility, ease of use, or speed, and have remained out of reach thus far for the vast majority of images generated in this context. This paper describes the implementation and integration of indirect illumination within a feature animation production renderer. For efficiency reasons, we choose to partially solve the rendering equation. We explain how this compromise allows us to speed-up final gathering calculations and reduce noise. We describe an efficient ray tracing strategy and its integration with a micro-polygon based scan line renderer supporting displacement mapping and programmable shaders. We combine a modified irradiance gradient caching technique with an approximate lighting model that enhances caching coherence and provides good scalability to render complex scenes into high-resolution images suitable for film. We describe the tools that are made available to the artists to control indirect lighting in final renders. We show that our approach provides an efficient solution, easy to art direct, that allows animators to enhance considerably the quality of images generated for a large category of production work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15423","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15423","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15424","fieldValue":" This paper focuses on efficient rendering based on pre-computed light transport, with realistic materials and shadows under all-frequency direct lighting such an environment maps. The basic difficulty is representation and computation in the 6D space of light direction, view direction, and surface position. While image-based and synthetic methods for real-time rendering have been proposed, they do not scale to high sampling rates with variation of both lighting and viewpoint. Current approaches are therefore limited to lower dimensionality (only lighting or viewpoint variation, not both) or lower sampling rates (low frequency lighting and materials). We propose a new mathematical and computational analysis of pre-computed light transport. We use factored forms, separately pre-computing and representing visibility and material properties. Rendering then requires computing triple product integrals at each vertex, involving the lighting, visibility and BRDF. Our main contribution is a general analysis of these triple product integrals, which are likely to have broad applicability in computer graphics and numerical analysis. We first determine the computational complexity in a number of bases like point samples, spherical harmonics and wavelets. We then give efficient linear and sublinear-time algorithms for Haar wavelets, incorporating non-linear wavelet approximation of lighting and BRDFs. Practically, we demonstrate rendering of images under new lighting and viewing conditions in a few seconds, significantly faster than previous techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15424","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15424","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15425","fieldValue":"Jodoin, Pierre-Marc"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15425","fieldValue":" This paper presents a novel method for efficiently generating a good sampling pattern given an importance density over a 2D domain. A Penrose tiling is hierarchically subdivided creating a sufficiently large number of sample points. These points are numbered using the Fibonacci number system, and these numbers are used to threshold the samples against the local value of the importance density. Pre-computed correction vectors, obtained using relaxation, are used to improve the spectral characteristics of the sampling pattern. The technique is deterministic and very fast; the sampling time grows linearly with the required number of samples. We illustrate our technique with importance-based environment mapping, but the technique is versatile enough to be used in a large variety of computer graphics applications, such as light transport calculations, digital halftoning, geometry processing, and various rendering techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15425","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15425","fieldValue":"ACM"}
