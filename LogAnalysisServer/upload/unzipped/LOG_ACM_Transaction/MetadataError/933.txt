This graphical data space is viewed through a color raster-scan display which enables users to traverse the GDS surface or zoom into the image to obtain greater detail. In contrast to conventional database management systems, in which users access data by asking questions in a formal query language, a spatial data management system (SDMS) presents the information graphically in a form that seems to encourage browsing and to require less prior knowledge of the contents and organization of the database.This paper presents an overview of the SDMS concept and describes its implementation in a prototype system for retrieving information from both a symbolic database management system and an optical videodisk."}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.ispartof","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_MULTIPLE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13876","fieldValue":"{\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13623\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, Dec  1980\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.ispartof","informationCode":"WARN_JSON_MINIFY","handle":"12345678_acm\/13876","fieldValue":"{\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13623\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, Dec  1980\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13877","fieldValue":" The problem of whether a given dependency in a database relation can be derived from a given set of dependencies is investigated. We show that the problem can be decided in polynomial time when the given set consists of either multivalued dependencies only or of both functional and multivalued dependencies and the given dependency is also either a functional or a multivalued dependency. These results hold when the derivations are restricted not to use the complementation rule."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13877","fieldValue":"ACM"}
