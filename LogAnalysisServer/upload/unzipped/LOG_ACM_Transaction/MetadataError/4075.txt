But usually one needs to browse only a small fragment of a Web page to perform a transactional step such as a form fillout, selecting an item from a search results list, and so on. We exploit this observation to develop an automata-based process model that delivers only the â\u20ACœrelevantâ\u20AC? page fragments at each transactional step, thereby reducing information overload on such narrow interaction bandwidths. We realize this model by coupling techniques from content analysis of Web documents, automata learning and statistical classification. The process model and associated techniques have been incorporated into Guide-O, a prototype system that facilitates online transactions using speech\/keyboard interface (Guide-O-Speech), or with limited-display size handhelds (Guide-O-Mobile). Performance of Guide-O and its user experience are reported."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23163","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23163","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23164","fieldValue":" On-demand streaming from a remote server through best-effort Internet poses several challenges because of network losses and variable delays. The primary technique used to improve the quality of distributed content service is replication. In the context of the Internet, Web caching is the traditional mechanism that is used. In this article we develop a new staged delivery model for a distributed architecture in which video is streamed from remote servers to edge caches where the video is buffered and then streamed to the client through a last-mile connection. The model uses a novel revolving indexed cache buffer management mechanism at the edge cache and employs selective retransmissions of lost packets between the remote and edge cache for a best-effort recovery of the losses. The new Web cache buffer management scheme includes a dynamic adjustment of cache buffer parameters based on network conditions. In addition, performance of buffer management and retransmission policies at the edge cache is modeled and assessed using a probabilistic analysis of the streaming process as well as system simulations. The influence of different endogenous control parameters on the quality of stream received by the client is studied. Calibration curves on the QoS metrics for different network conditions have been obtained using simulations. Edge cache management can be done using these calibration curves. ISPs can make use of calibration curves to set the values of the endogenous control parameters for specific QoS in real-time streaming operations based on network conditions. A methodology to benchmark transmission characteristics using real-time traffic data is developed to enable effective decision making on edge cache buffer allocation and management strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23164","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23164","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23165","fieldValue":" Service-oriented architectures are increasingly used in the context of business processes. However, the proven practices for process-oriented integration of services are not well documented yet. In addition, modeling approaches for the integration of processes and services are neither mature nor do they exactly reflect the proven practices. In this article, we propose a pattern language for process-oriented integration of services to describe the proven practices. Our main contribution is a modeling concept based on pattern primitives for these patterns. A pattern primitive is a fundamental, precisely specified modeling element that represents a pattern. We present a catalog of pattern primitives that are precisely modeled using OCL constraints and map these primitives to the patterns in the pattern language of process-oriented integration of services. We also present a model validation tool that we have developed to support modeling the process-oriented integration of services, and an industrial case study in which we have applied our results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23165","fieldValue":"ACM"}
