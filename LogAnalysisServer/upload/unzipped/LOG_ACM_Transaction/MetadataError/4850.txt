To perform some subsequent processing, such as digital audio forensics, audio enhancement and blind audio quality assessment, it is necessary to identify its compression history. In this article, we will investigate how to identify a decompressed wave audio that went through one of three popular compression schemes, including MP3, WMA (windows media audio) and AAC (advanced audio coding). By analyzing the corresponding frequency coefficients, including modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), of those original audio clips and their decompressed versions with different compression schemes and bit rates, we propose several statistics to identify the compression scheme as well as the corresponding bit rate previously used for a given WAV signal. The experimental results evaluated on 8,800 audio clips with various contents have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, some potential applications of the proposed method are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25567","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25567","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.editor","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25568","fieldValue":"Zha, Zheng-Jun"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.editor","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25568","fieldValue":"Smeaton, Alan F"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.editor","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25568","fieldValue":"Del Bimbo, Alberto"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/25568","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"13\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/25574\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) : Volume 13\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"12\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/25573\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) : Volume 12\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"11\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/25572\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) : Volume 11\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"10\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/25571\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) : Volume 10\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"9\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/25570\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) : Volume 9\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"8\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/25569\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) : Volume 8\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3469","fieldValue":" We performed a perceptual user study of algorithms that approximate soft shadows in real time. Although a huge body of soft-shadow algorithms have been proposed, to our knowledge this is the first methodical study for comparing different real-time shadow algorithms with respect to their plausibility and visual appearance. We evaluated soft-shadow properties like penumbra overlap with respect to their relevance to shadow perception in a systematic way, and we believe that our results can be useful to guide future shadow approaches in their methods of evaluation. In this study, we also capture the predominant case of an inexperienced user observing shadows without comparing to a reference solution, such as when watching a movie or playing a game. One important result of this experiment is to scientifically verify that real-time soft-shadow algorithms, despite having become physically based and very realistic, can nevertheless be intuitively distinguished from a correct solution by untrained users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3469","fieldValue":"ACM"}
