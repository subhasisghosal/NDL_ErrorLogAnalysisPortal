At the end, all the leaves of the tree are square cells that lie completely inside or outside the object. There are two great disadvantages in the use of quadtrees as a representation scheme for objects in geometric modeling system: The amount of memory required for polygonal objects is too great, and it is difficult to recompute the boundary representation of the object after some Boolean operations have been performed. In the present paper a new class of quadtrees, in which nodes may contain zero or one edge, is introduced. By using these quadtrees, storage requirements are reduced and it is possible to obtain the exact backward conversion to boundary representation. Algorithms for the generation of the quadtree, Boolean operations, and recomputation of the boundary representation are presented, and their complexities in time and space are discussed. Three-dimensional algorithms working on octrees are also presented. Their use in the geometric modeling of three-dimensional polyhedral objects is discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14960","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14960","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2411","fieldValue":" Rank-convolutions have important applications in a variety of areas such as signal processing and computer vision. We define a mask as a function taking only values zero and infinity. Rank-convolutions with masks are of special interest to image processing. We show how to compute the rank-k convolution of a function over an interval of length n with an arbitrary mask of length m in O(n&sqrt;m log m) time. The result generalizes to the d-dimensional case. Previously no algorithm performing significantly better than the brute-force O(nm) bound was known. Our algorithm seems to perform well in practice. We describe an implementation, illustrating its application to a problem in image processing. Already on relatively small images, our experiments show a signficant speedup compared to brute force."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2411","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2411","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14961","fieldValue":"OCallaghan, John F."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14961","fieldValue":" Superimposition of two image data sets allows the spatial distribution of one to be directly related to that of the other. If the two data sets have different spatial structures, the composite image is generally confusing and difficult to interpret. A method of representing image data sets in the form of naturally occurring variables in a realistic apparently three-dimensional scene is presented. One data set is represented by the topography of a surface, depicted by shaded-relief methods, while another is represented by the color of the surface, or by the color of an overlaid transparency. Presentation in this form exploits the normal scene decomposition abilities of the human visual system, allowing intuitive appreciation and separation of the scene, and hence data set, variables. The method relies on techniques for the modeling of surfaces and surface reflectance to render the synthesised scenes realistically."}
