The optimizations are implemented in a prototype code named FErari, which has been integrated as an optimizing backend to the FEniCS form compiler, FFC [Kirby and Logg 2006; 2007]. In some cases, FErari provides very little speedup, while in other cases we obtain reduced local operation counts by a factor of as much as 7.9 and speedups for the assembly of the global sparse matrix by as much as a factor of 2.8 (see Figure 9)."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19215","fieldValue":"FFC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19215","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19215","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19216","fieldValue":"Quintana-Ort, Enrique S"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19216","fieldValue":"Van De Geijn, Robert A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19216","fieldValue":" We show how to compute an LU factorization of a matrix when the factors of a leading principle submatrix are already known. The approach incorporates pivoting akin to partial pivoting, a strategy we call incremental pivoting. An implementation using the Formal Linear Algebra Methods Environment (FLAME) application programming interface (API) is described. Experimental results demonstrate practical numerical stability and high performance on an Intel Itanium2 processor-based server."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19216","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19216","fieldValue":"ACM"}
