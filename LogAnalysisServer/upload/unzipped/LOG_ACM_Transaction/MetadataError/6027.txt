[2003]. In this game, each player (vertex) can create links (edges) to other players at a cost of Î± per edge. The goal of every player is to minimize the sum consisting of (a) the cost of the links he has created and (b) the sum of the distances to all other players. Fabrikant et al. conjectured that there exists a constant A such that, for any Î± > A, all nontransient Nash equilibria graphs are trees. They showed that if a Nash equilibrium is a tree, the price of anarchy is constant. In this article, we disprove the tree conjecture. More precisely, we show that for any positive integer $n_0, there exists a graph built by n â\u2030¥ n0$ players which contains cycles and forms a nontransient Nash equilibrium, for any Î± with 1 < Î± â\u2030¤ âˆšn\/2. Our construction makes use of some interesting results on finite affine planes. On the other hand, we show that, for Î± â\u2030¥ 12n âŒˆlog nâŒ\u2030, every Nash equilibrium forms a tree. Without relying on the tree conjecture, Fabrikant et al. proved an upper bound on the price of anarchy of O(âˆšÎ±), where Î± âˆˆ [2, $n^2. We improve this bound. Specifically, we derive a constant upper bound for Î± âˆˆ O(âˆšn) and for Î± â\u2030¥ 12n âŒˆlog nâŒ\u2030. For the intermediate values, we derive an improved bound of O(1 + (min{Î±2\/n, n2\/Î±})1\/3$). Additionally, we develop characterizations of Nash equilibria and extend our results to a weighted network creation game as well as to scenarios with cost sharing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6008","fieldValue":"Spieksma, Frits C R"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6008","fieldValue":"De Rock, Bram"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6008","fieldValue":" We provide results on the computational complexity of goodness-of-fit measures (i.e., Afriatâ\u20AC™s efficiency index, Varianâ\u20AC™s efficiency vector-index, and the Houtman-Maks index) associated with several revealed preference axioms (i.e., WARP, SARP, GARP, and HARP). These results explain the computational difficulties that have been observed in literature when computing these indices. Our NP-hardness results are obtained by reductions from the independent set problem.
