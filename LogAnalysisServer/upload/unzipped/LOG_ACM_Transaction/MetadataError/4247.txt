{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23793","fieldValue":" Over the last decade, arithmetic coding has emerged as an important compression tool. It is now the method of choice for adaptive coding on myltisymbol alphabets because of its speed, low storage requirements, and effectiveness of compression. This article describes a new implementation of arithmetic coding that incorporates several improvements over a widely used earlier version by Witten, Neal, and Cleary, which has become a de facto standard. These improvements include fewer multiplicative operations, greatly extended range of alphabet sizes and symbol probabilities, and the use of low-precision arithmetic, permitting implementation by fast shift\/add operations. We also describe a modular structure that separates the coding, modeling, and probability estimation components of a compression system. To motivate the improved coder, we consider the needs of a word-based text compression program. We report a range of experimental results using this and other models.

Psychometric methods might show that contents have an influence on image quality, but they do not tell what this influence is like, i.e., how the contents influence image quality. To obtain a holistic description of subjective image quality, we have used an interpretation-based quality (IBQ) estimation approach, which combines qualitative and quantitative methodology. The method enables simultaneous examination of psychometric results and the subjective meanings related to the perceived image-quality changes. In this way, the relationship between subjective feature detection, subjective preferences, and interpretations are revealed. We report a study that shows that different impressions are conveyed in five test image contents after similar sharpness variations. Thirty na√Øve observers classified and freely described the images after which magnitude estimation was used to verify that they distinguished the changes in the images. The data suggest that in the case of high image quality, the test image selection is crucial. If subjective evaluation is limited only to technical defects in test images, important subjective information of image-quality experience is lost. The approach described here can be used to examine image quality and it will help image scientists to evaluate their test images."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3310","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3310","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23794","fieldValue":"Shariff, A.

Current GIS's provide only rudimentary support for processing and interpreting natural-language-like spatial relations, because their models and representations are primarily quantitative, while natural-language spatial relations are usually dominated by qualitative properties. Studies of the use of spatial relations in natural language showed that topology accounts for a significant portion of the geometric properties. This article develops a formal model that captures metric details for the description of natural-language spatial relations. The metric details are expressed as refinements of the categories identified by the 9-intersection, a model for topological spatial relations, and provide a more precise measure than does topology alone as to whether a geometric configuration matches with a spatial term or not. Similarly, these measures help in identifying the spatial term that describes a particular configuration. Two groups of metric details are derived: splitting ratios as the normalized values of lengths and areas of intersections; and closeness measures as the normalized distances between disjoint object parts. The resulting model of topological and metric properties was calibrated for 64 spatial terms in English, providing values for the best fit as well as value ranges for the significant parameters of each term. Three examples demonstrate how the framework and its calibrated values are used to determine the best spatial term for a relationship between two geometric objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23794","fieldValue":"GIS"}
