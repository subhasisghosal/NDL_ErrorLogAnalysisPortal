To remedy this deficiency, we propose an optimal tradeoff approach that: 1) constructs a hybrid routing protocol by combining well-known location-update schemes (i.e., proactive location updates within nodes' local regions and a distributed location service), and 2) derives its optimal configuration, in terms of location-update thresholds (both distance- and time-based), to minimize the overall routing overhead. We also build a route-discovery scheme based on an Internet-like architecture, i.e., first querying the location of a destination, then applying a series of local-region routing until finding a complete route by aggregating the thus-found partial routes. To find the optimal thresholds for the hybrid protocol, we derive the costs associated with both location updates and route discovery as a function of location-update thresholds, assuming a random mobility model and a general distribution for route request arrivals. The problem of minimizing the total cost is then cast into a distributed optimization problem. We first prove that the total cost is a convex function of the thresholds, and then derive the optimal thresholds. Finally, we show, via simulation, that our analysis results indeed capture the real behavior."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9338","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9339","fieldValue":" We study the problem of stable scheduling for a class of wireless networks. The goal is to stabilize the queues holding information to be transmitted over a fading channel. Few assumptions are made on the arrival process statistics other than the assumption that their mean values lie within the capacity region and that they satisfy a version of the law of large numbers. We prove that, for any mean arrival rate that lies in the capacity region, the queues will be stable under our policy. Moreover, we show that it is easy to incorporate imperfect queue length information and other approximations that can simplify the implementation of our policy."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9339","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9339","fieldValue":"ACM"}
