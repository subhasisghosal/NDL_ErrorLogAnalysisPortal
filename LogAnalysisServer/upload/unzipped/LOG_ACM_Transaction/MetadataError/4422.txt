In this article, we address the design of the portal page of a Web site, which serves as the homepage of a Web site or a default Web portal. We define an important research problem---hyperlink selection: selecting from a large set of hyperlinks in a given Web site, a limited number of hyperlinks for inclusion in a portal page. The objective of hyperlink selection is to maximize the efficiency, effectiveness, and usage of a Web site's portal page. We propose a heuristic approach to hyperlink selection, LinkSelector, which is based on relationships among hyperlinks---structural relationships that can be extracted from an existing Web site and access relationships that can be discovered from a Web log. We compared the performance of LinkSelector with that of the current practice of hyperlink selection (i.e., manual hyperlink selection by domain experts), using data obtained from the University of Arizona Web site. Results showed that LinkSelector outperformed the current manual selection method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3356","fieldValue":"OSullivan, Carol"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3356","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3356","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24306","fieldValue":" WASH\/CGI is an embedded domain-specific language for server-side Web scripting. Due to its reliance on the strongly typed, purely functional programming language Haskell as a host language, it is highly flexible and---at the same time---it provides extensive guarantees due to its pervasive use of type information.WASH\/CGI can be structured into a number of sublanguages addressing different aspects of the application. The document sublanguage provides tools for the generation of parameterized XHTML documents and forms. Its typing guarantees that almost all generated documents are valid XHTML documents. The session sublanguage provides a session abstraction with a transparent notion of session state and allows the composition of documents and Web forms to entire interactive scripts. Both are integrated with the widget sublanguage which describes the communication (parameter passing) between client and server. It imposes a simple type discipline on the parameters that guarantees that forms posted by the client are always understood by the server. That is, the server never asks for data not submitted by the client and the data submitted by the client has the type requested by the server. In addition, parameters are received in their typed internal representation, not as strings. Finally, the persistence sublanguage deals with managing shared state on the server side as well as individual state on the client side. It presents shared state as an abstract data type, where the script can control whether it wants to observe mutations due to concurrently executing scripts. It guarantees that states from different interaction threads cannot be confused."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24306","fieldValue":"ACM"}
