{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9468","fieldValue":" Cooperative broadcast aims to deliver a source message to a locally connected network by means of collaborating nodes. In traditional architectures, node cooperation has been at the network layer. Recently, physical layer cooperative schemes have been shown to offer several advantages over the network layer approaches. This form of cooperation employs distributed transmission resources at the physical layer as a single radio with spatial diversity. In decentralized cooperation schemes, collaborating nodes make transmission decisions based on the quality of the received signal, which is the only parameter available locally. In this case, critical parameters that influence the broadcast performance include the source\/relay transmission powers and the decoding threshold (the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to decode a transmission). We study the effect of these parameters on the number of nodes reached by cooperative broadcast. In particular, we show that there exists a phase transition in the network behavior: if the decoding threshold is below a critical value, the message is delivered to the whole network. Otherwise, only a fraction of the nodes is reached, which is proportional to the source transmit power. Our approach is based on the idea of continuum approximation, which yields closed-form expressions that are accurate when the network density is high."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9468","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9468","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9468","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9468","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9469","fieldValue":" LT-codes are a new class of codes introduced by Luby for the purpose of scalable and fault-tolerant distribution of data over computer networks. In this paper, we introduce Raptor codes, an extension of LT-codes with linear time encoding and decoding. We will exhibit a class of universal Raptor codes: for a given integer k and any real ε > 0, Raptor codes in this class produce a potentially infinite stream of symbols such that any subset of symbols of size k(1 + ε) is sufficient to recover the original k symbols with high probability. Each output symbol is generated using O(log(1\/ ε)) operations, and the original symbols are recovered from the collected ones with O(k log(1\/ε)) operations.We will also introduce novel techniques for the analysis of the error probability of the decoder for finite length Raptor codes. Moreover, we will introduce and analyze systematic versions of Raptor codes, i.e., versions in which the first output elements of the coding system coincide with the original k elements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9469","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9469","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9469","fieldValue":"ACM"}
