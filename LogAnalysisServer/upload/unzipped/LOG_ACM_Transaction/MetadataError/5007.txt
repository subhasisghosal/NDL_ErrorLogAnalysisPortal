It is shown that the MV distributions are quite distinct while binaural models overlap when the sources are close to each other. On the other hand, the binaural cues are more robust to high reverberation than MV models. According to this complementary behavior we introduce a new robust algorithm for stereo speech separation which considers both additive and convolutive noise signals to model the MV and binaural cues in parallel and estimate probabilistic time-frequency masks. The contribution of each cue to the final decision is also adjusted by weighting the log-likelihoods of the cues empirically. Furthermore, the permutation problem of the frequency domain blind source separation (BSS) is addressed by initializing the MVs based on binaural cues. Experiments are performed systematically on determined and underdetermined speech mixtures in five rooms with various acoustic properties including anechoic, highly reverberant, and spatially-diffuse noise conditions. The results in terms of signal-to-distortion-ratio (SDR) confirm the benefits of integrating the MV and binaural cues, as compared with two state-of-the-art baseline algorithms which only use MV or the binaural cues."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3694","fieldValue":" Differential microphone arrays (DMAs), due to their small size and enhanced directivity, are quite promising in speech enhancement applications. However, it is well known that differential beamformers have the drawback of white noise amplification, which is a major issue in the processing of wideband signals such as speech. In this paper, we focus on the design of robust DMAs. Based on the Maclaurin's series approximation and frequency-independent beampatterns, the robust first-, second-, and third-order DMAs are proposed by using more microphones than the order plus one, and the corresponding minimum-norm filters are derived. Compared to the traditional DMAs, the proposed designs are more robust with respect to white noise amplification while they are capable of achieving similar directional gains."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3695","fieldValue":" We propose a robust event-based method for estimation of the instantaneous fundamental frequency of a voiced speech signal. The amplitude and frequency modulated (AM-FM) signal model of voiced speech in the low frequency range (LFR) indicates the presence of energy only around its instantaneous fundamental frequency (F0) and its few harmonics. The time-varying F0 component of a voiced speech signal is extracted by a robust algorithm which iteratively performs eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of the Hankel matrix, initially constructed from samples of the LFR filtered voiced speech signal. The negative cycles of the extracted time-varying F0 component provide a reliable coarse estimate of intervals where glottal closure instants (GCIs) may be present. The negative cycles of the LFR filtered voiced speech signal occurring within these intervals are isolated. There is a sudden decrease in the glottal impedance at GCIs resulting in high signal strength. Therefore, GCIs are detected as local minima in the derivative of the falling edges of the isolated negative cycles of the LFR filtered voiced speech signal, followed by a selection criterion to discard false GCI candidates. The instantaneous F0 is estimated as the inverse of the time interval between two consecutive GCIs. Experiments were performed on the Keele and CSTR speech databases in white and babble noise environments at various levels of degradation to assess the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method substantially reduces the gross F0 estimation errors in comparison to some state of the art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3695","fieldValue":"Event-based method for instantaneous fundamental frequency estimation from voiced speech based on eigenvalue decomposition of the Hankel matrix"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3695","fieldValue":"ACM"}
