It allows the fast and accurate computation of the eigenvalues and the visualization of the corresponding eigenfunctions. This is realized by making use of the power of high-order piecewise constant perturbation methods, a technique described by Ixaru. For a well-outlined class of problems, the implemented algorithms are more efficient than the well-established SL-solvers SL02f, SLEDGE, SLEIGN, and SLEIGN2, which are included by Pryce in the SLDRIVER code that has been built on top of SLTSTPAK."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19117","fieldValue":"Schr&ouml;dinger equations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19117","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19117","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19118","fieldValue":" MixedVol is a C&plus;&plus; software package that computes the mixed volume of n finite subsets of $&Zopf;^n$ or the support of a system of n polynomials in n variables. The software produces the mixed volume as well as the mixed cells. The mixed cells are crucial for solving polynomial systems by the polyhedral homotopy continuation method. The software leads existing codes for mixed-volume computation in speed by a substantial margin and its memory requirement is very low."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19118","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19118","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19119","fieldValue":" To recover or approximate smooth multivariate functions, sparse grids are superior to full grids due to a significant reduction of the required support nodes. The order of the convergence rate in the maximum norm is preserved up to a logarithmic factor. We describe three possible piecewise multilinear hierarchical interpolation schemes in detail and conduct a numerical comparison. Furthermore, we document the features of our sparse grid interpolation software package spinterp for MATLAB."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19119","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19119","fieldValue":"ACM"}
