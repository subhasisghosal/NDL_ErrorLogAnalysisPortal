The cell responds to heat shock by raising the levels of heat shock proteins (hsp), which are responsible for chaperoning protein refolding. The synthesis ofhspis highly regulated at the transcription level by specific heat shock (transcription) factors (hsf). One of the regulation mechanisms is the phosphorylation ofhsf's. Experimental evidence shows a connection between the hyper-phosphorylation ofhsfs and the transactivation of thehsp-encoding genes. In this paper, we incorporate several (de)phosphorylation pathways into an existing well-validated computational model of the heat shock response. We analyze the quantitative control of each of these pathways over the entire process. For each of these pathways we create detailed computational models which we subject to parameter estimation in order to fit them to existing experimental data. In particular, we find conclusive evidence supporting only one of the analyzed pathways. Also, we corroborate our results with a set of computational models of a more reduced size."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4816","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4816","fieldValue":"Simulation, modeling, computing methodologies, biology and genetics, computer applications, heat shock response, protein phosphorylation, quantitative refinement."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4816","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4816","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4817","fieldValue":" This paper is concerned with the analysis of labeled Thomas networks using discrete time series. It focuses on refining the given edge labels and on assessing the data quality. The results are aimed at being exploitable for experimental design and include the prediction of new activatory or inhibitory effects of given interactions and yet unobserved oscillations of specific components in between specific sampling intervals. On the formal side, we generalize the concept of edge labels and introduce a discrete time series interpretation. This interpretation features two original concepts: 1) Incomplete measurements are admissible, and 2) it allows qualitative assumptions about the changes in gene expression by means of monotonicity. On the computational side, we provide a Python script, erda.py, that automates the suggested workflow by model checking and constraint satisfaction. We illustrate the workflow by investigating the yeast network IRMA."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4817","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4817","fieldValue":"Time series analysis,Regulators,Computational modeling,Time measurement,Bioinformatics,Computational biology,Labeling,constraint satisfaction.,Time series analysis,model checking,temporal logic,biology and genetics"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4817","fieldValue":"ACM"}
