{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17778","fieldValue":" Recently, a negative interplay has been shown to arise when scheduling\/Active Queue Management (AQM) techniques and low-priority congestion control protocols are used together; namely, AQM resets the relative level of priority among congestion control protocols. This work explores this issue by carrying out a control-theoretic analysis of the dynamical system to prove some fundamental properties that fully characterize the reprioritization phenomenon. In particular, (i) we provide the closed-form solution of the equilibrium in the open loop (i.e., fixing a target loss probability p); (ii) we provide a stability analysis and a characterization of the reprioritization phenomenon when closing the loop with AQM (i.e., that dynamically adjusts the system loss probability). Our results are important as the characterization of the reprioritization phenomenon is not only quantitatively accurate for the specific protocols and AQM considered but also qualitatively accurate for a broader range of congestion control protocol and AQM combinations. Finally, while we find a sufficient condition to avoid the reprioritization phenomenon, we also show, at the same time, such conditions to be likely impractical: Therefore, we propose a simple and practical system-level solution that is able to reinstate priorities among protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17778","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Telecom ParisTech, Paris, France (Gong, Yixi); LTCI UMR5141, Telecom ParisTech, Universit&#233; Paris Saclay (Rossi, Dario); Politecnico di Torino, Italy (Leonardi, Emilio); Politecnico di Bari, Italy (Cicco, Luca De)"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17778","fieldValue":"AQM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17778","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17778","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17779","fieldValue":" Data centers are key participants in demand response programs, including emergency demand response (EDR), in which the grid coordinates consumers of large amounts of electricity for demand reduction in emergency situations to prevent major economic losses. While existing literature concentrates on owner-operated data centers, this work studies EDR in geo-distributed multitenant colocation data centers in which servers are owned and managed by individual tenants. EDR in colocation data centers is significantly more challenging due to lack of incentives to reduce energy consumption by tenants who control their servers and are typically on fixed power contracts with the colocation operator. Consequently, to achieve demand reduction goals set by the EDR program, the operator has to rely on the highly expensive and\/or environmentally unfriendly on-site energy backup\/generation. To reduce cost and environmental impact, an efficient incentive mechanism is therefore needed, motivating tenants‚\u20ACô voluntary energy reduction in the case of EDR. This work proposes a novel incentive mechanism, Truth-DR, which leverages a reverse auction to provide monetary remuneration to tenants according to their agreed energy reduction. Truth-DR is computationally efficient, truthful, and achieves 2-approximation in colocation-wide social cost. Trace-driven simulations verify the efficacy of the proposed auction mechanism."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17779","fieldValue":"A Truthful Incentive Mechanism for Emergency Demand Response in Geo-Distributed Colocation Data Centers"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17779","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17779","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2681","fieldValue":" A maximal matching can be maintained in fully dynamic (supporting both addition and deletion of edges) n-vertex graphs using a trivial deterministic algorithm with a worst-case update time of O(n). No deterministic algorithm that outperforms the na√Øve O(n) one was reported up to this date. The only progress in this direction is due to Ivkoviƒ\u2021 and Lloyd, who in 1993 devised a deterministic algorithm with an amortized update time of $O((n+m)^&sqrt;2\/2$), where m is the number of edges. In this article, we show the first deterministic fully dynamic algorithm that outperforms the trivial one. Specifically, we provide a deterministic worst-case update time of O(&sqrt;m). Moreover, our algorithm maintains a matching, which in fact is a 3\/2-approximate maximum cardinality matching (MCM). We remark that no fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining (2 ‚à\u2019 &epsi;)-approximate MCM improving upon the na√Øve O(n) was known prior to this work, even allowing amortized time bounds and randomization. For low arboricity graphs (e.g., planar graphs and graphs excluding fixed minors), we devise another simple deterministic algorithm with sublogarithmic update time. Specifically, it maintains a fully dynamic maximal matching with amortized update time of O(log‚\u20AC\u2030n\/log‚\u20AC\u2030log‚\u20AC\u2030n). This result addresses an open question of Onak and Rubinfeld [2010]. We also show a deterministic algorithm with optimal space usage, which for arbitrary graphs maintains a maximal matching in amortized O(&sqrt;m) time and uses only O(n + m) space."}
