In this paper we present an end-to-end system for object copy & paste in a stereoscopic setting to address this need. There is no straightforward extension of 2D copy & paste to support the addition of the third dimension as we show in this paper. For stereoscopic copy & paste we need to handle depth, and our core objective is to obtain a convincing 3D viewing experience. As one of the main contributions of our system, we introduce a stereo billboard method for stereoscopic rendering of the copied selection. Our approach preserves the stereo volume and is robust to the inevitable inaccuracies of the depth maps computed from a stereo pair of images. Our system also includes an interactive stereoscopic segmentation tool to achieve high quality object selection. Hence, we focus on intuitive and minimal user interaction, and our editing operations perform within interactive rates to provide immediate feedback."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16360","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16360","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16361","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16361","fieldValue":" We present a system for quick and easy manipulation of the body shape and proportions of a human actor in arbitrary video footage. The approach is based on a morphable model of 3D human shape and pose that was learned from laser scans of real people. The algorithm commences by spatio-temporally fitting the pose and shape of this model to the actor in either single-view or multi-view video footage. Once the model has been fitted, semantically meaningful attributes of body shape, such as height, weight or waist girth, can be interactively modified by the user. The changed proportions of the virtual human model are then applied to the actor in all video frames by performing an image-based warping. By this means, we can now conveniently perform spatio-temporal reshaping of human actors in video footage which we show on a variety of video sequences."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16361","fieldValue":"ACM"}
