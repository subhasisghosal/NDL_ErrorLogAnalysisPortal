We present animation space, a generalization of SSD that greatly reduces these effects and effectively eliminates them for joints that do not have an unusually large range of motion.While other, more expensive generalizations exist, ours is unique in expressing the animation process as a simple linear transformation of the input coordinates. We show that linearity can be used to derive a measure of average distance (across the space of poses), and apply this to improving parametrizations.Linearity also makes it possible to fit a model to a set of examples using least-squares methods. The extra generality in animation space allows for a good fit to realistic data, and overfitting can be controlled to allow fitted models to generalize to new poses. Despite the extra vertex attributes, it is possible to render these animation-space models in hardware with no loss of performance relative to SSD."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15742","fieldValue":" Barycentric coordinates for triangles are commonly used in computer graphics, geometric modeling, and other computational sciences because they provide a convenient way to linearly interpolate the data that is given at the corners of a triangle. The concept of barycentric coordinates can also be extended in several ways to convex polygons with more than three vertices, but most of these constructions break down when used in the nonconvex setting. Mean value coordinates offer a choice that is not limited to convex configurations, and we show that they are in fact well-defined for arbitrary planar polygons without self-intersections. Besides their many other important properties, these coordinate functions are smooth and allow an efficient and robust implementation. They are particularly useful for interpolating data that is given at the vertices of the polygons and we present several examples of their application to common problems in computer graphics and geometric modeling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15743","fieldValue":" In this article we revisit the concept of Wang tiles and introduce corner tiles, square tiles with colored corners. During past years, Wang tiles have become a valuable tool in computer graphics. Important applications of Wang tiles include texture synthesis, tile-based texture mapping, and generating Poisson disk distributions. Through their colored edges, Wang tiles enforce continuity with their direct neighbors. However, Wang tiles do not directly constrain their diagonal neighbors. This leads to continuity problems near tile corners, a problem commonly known as the corner problem. Corner tiles, on the other hand, do impose restrictions on their diagonal neighbors, and thus are not subject to the corner problem. In this article we show that previous applications of Wang tiles can also be done using corner tiles, but that corner tiles have distinct advantages for each of these applications. Compared to Wang tiles, corner tiles are easier to tile, textures synthesized with corner tiles contain more samples from the original texture, corner tiles reduce the required texture memory by a factor of two for tile-based texture mapping, and Poisson disk distributions generated with corner tiles have better spectral properties. Corner tiles result in cleaner, simpler, and more efficient applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15743","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15743","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15744","fieldValue":" We present a new globally smooth parameterization method for the triangulated surfaces of arbitrary topology. Given two orthogonal piecewise linear vector fields defined over the input mesh (typically the estimated principal curvature directions), our method computes two piecewise linear periodic functions, aligned with the input vector fields, by minimizing an objective function. The bivariate function they define is a smooth parameterization almost everywhere on the surface, except in the vicinity of singular vertices, edges, and triangles, where the derivatives of the parameterization vanish. We extract a quadrilateral chart layout from the parameterization function and propose an automatic procedure to detect the singularities, and fix them by splitting and reparameterizing the containing charts. Our method can construct both quasiconformal (angle preserving) and quasi-isometric (angle and area preserving) parameterizations. The more restrictive class of quasi-isometric parameterizations is constructed at the expense of introducing more singularities. The constructed parameterizations can be used for a variety of geometry processing applications. Since we can align the parameterization with the principal curvature directions, our result is particularly suitable for surface fitting and remeshing."}
