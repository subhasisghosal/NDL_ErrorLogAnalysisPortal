In wireless networks, where the error rate is high and the bandwidth is limited, the design of key management schemes should place emphasis on reducing the communication burden associated with key updating. A communication-efficient class of key management schemes is those that employ a tree hierarchy. However, these tree-based key management schemes do not exploit issues related to the delivery of keying information that provide opportunities to further reduce the communication burden of rekeying. In this paper, we propose a method for designing multicast key management trees that match the network topology. The proposed key management scheme localizes the transmission of keying information and significantly reduces the communication burden of rekeying. Further, in mobile wireless applications, the issue of user handoff between base stations may cause user relocation on the key management tree. We address the problem of user handoff by proposing an efficient handoff scheme for our topology-matching key management trees. The proposed scheme also addresses the heterogeneity of the network. For multicast applications containing several thousands of users, simulations indicate a 55%-80% reduction in the communication cost compared to key trees that are independent of the network topology. Analysis and simulations also show that the communication cost of the proposed topology-matching key management tree scales better than topology-independent trees as the size of multicast group grows."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9239","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9239","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9239","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9240","fieldValue":" Feedback signaling plays a key role in flow control because the traffic source relies on the signaling information to make correct and timely flow-control decisions. However, it is difficult to design an efficient signaling algorithm since a signaling message can tolerate neither error nor latency. Multicast flow-control signaling imposes two additional challenges: scalability and feedback synchronization. Previous research on multicast signaling has mainly focused on the development of algorithms without analyzing their delay performance. To remedy this deficiency, we have previously developed a binary-tree model and an independent-marking statistical model for multicast-signaling delay analysis. This paper considers a general scenario where the congestion markings at different links are dependent--a more accurate but complex case. Specifically, we develop a Markov-chain model defined by the link-marking state on each path in the multicast tree. The Markov chain can not only capture link-marking dependencies, but also yield a tractable analytical model. We also develop a Markov-chain dependency-degree model to evaluate all possible Markov-chain dependency degrees without any prior knowledge of them. Using the above two models, we derive the general probability distributions of each path becoming the multicast-tree bottleneck. Also derived are the first and second moments of multicast signaling delays. The proposed Markov chain is also shown to asymptotically reach an equilibrium, and its limiting distribution converges to the marginal link-marking probabilities when the Markov chain is irreducible. Applying the two models, we analyze and contrast the delay scalability of two representative multicast signaling protocols: Soft-Synchronization Protocol (SSP) and Hop-By-Hop (HBH) algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9240","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9240","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9240","fieldValue":"ACM"}
