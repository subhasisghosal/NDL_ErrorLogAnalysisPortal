In our approach we regard SO(3) as a Lie group with a bi-invariant Riemannian metriac, and apply the coordinate-invariant methods of Riemannian geometry. The resulting rotation curve is easy to compute, invariant with respect to fixed and moving reference frames, and also approximately minimizes angular acceleration."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15149","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15149","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15150","fieldValue":" In this article functional equations are used to characterize some families of surfaces. First, the most general surfaces in implicit form f(x, y, z) = 0, such that any arbitrary intersection with the planes z = z0, y = y0, and x = x0 are linear combinations of sets of functions of the other two variables, are characterized. It is shown that only linear combinations of tensor products of univariate functions are possible for fx, y, z). Second, we obtain the most general families of surfaces in explicit form such that their intersections with planes parallel to the planes y = 0 and x = 0 belong to two, not necessarily equal, parametric families of curves. Finally, functional equations are used to analyze the uniqueness of representation of Gordon-Coon surfaces. Some practical examples are used to illustrate the theoretical results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15150","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15150","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15151","fieldValue":"Snchez-Reyes, J."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15151","fieldValue":" A new polynomial basis over the unit interval tâˆˆ0,1 is proposed. The work is motivation by the fact that the monomial (power) form is not suitable in CAGD, as it suffers from serious numerical problems, and the monomial coefficients have no geometric meaning. The new form is the symmetric analogue of the power form, because it can be regarded as an â\u20ACœHermite two-point expansionâ\u20AC? instead of a Taylor expansion. This form enjoys good numerical properties and admits a Horner-like evaluation algorithm that is almost as fast as that of the power form. In a ddition, the symmetric power coeddicients convey a geometric meaning, and therefore they can be used as shape handles. A polynomial expressed in the symmetric power basis is decomposed into linear, cubic, quintic, and successive components. In consequence, this basis is better suited to handle polynomials of different degrees than the Bernstein basis, and those algorithms involving degree operations have extremely simple formulations. The minimum degree of a polynomial is immediately obtained by inspecting its coefficients. Degree reduction of a curve or surface reduces to drooping the desired high degree terms."}
