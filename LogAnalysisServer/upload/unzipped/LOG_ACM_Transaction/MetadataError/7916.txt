{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10646","fieldValue":" The Internet has recently been evolving from homogeneous congestion control to heterogeneous congestion control. Several years ago, Internet traffic was mainly controlled by the traditional RENO, whereas it is now controlled by multiple different TCP algorithms, such as RENO, CUBIC, and Compound TCP (CTCP). However, there is very little work on the performance and stability study of the Internet with heterogeneous congestion control. One fundamental reason is the lack of the deployment information of different TCP algorithms. In this paper, we first propose a tool called TCP Congestion Avoidance Algorithm Identification (CAAI) for actively identifying the TCP algorithm of a remote Web server. CAAI can identify all default TCP algorithms (e.g., RENO, CUBIC, and CTCP) and most non-default TCP algorithms of major operating system families. We then present the CAAI measurement result of about 30 000 Web servers. We found that only 3.31%-14.47% of the Web servers still use RENO, 46.92% of the Web servers use BIC or CUBIC, and 14.5%-25.66% of the Web servers use CTCP. Our measurement results show a strong sign that the majority of TCP flows are not controlled by RENO anymore, and a strong sign that the Internet congestion control has changed from homogeneous to heterogeneous."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10646","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10646","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10646","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10647","fieldValue":" In this paper, we investigate the utility maximization problem for a sensor network with energy replenishment. Each sensor node consumes energy in its battery to generate and deliver data to its destination via multihop communications. Although the battery can be replenished from renewable energy sources, the energy allocation should be carefully designed in order to maximize system performance, especially when the replenishment profile is unknown in advance. In this paper, we address the joint problem of energy allocation and routing to maximize the total system utility, without prior knowledge of the replenishment profile. We first characterize optimal throughput of a single node under general replenishment profile and extend our idea to the multihop network case. After characterizing the optimal network utility with an upper bound, we develop a low-complexity online solution that achieves asymptotic optimality. Focusing on long-term system performance, we can greatly simplify computational complexity while maintaining high performance. We also show that our solution can be approximated by a distributed algorithm using standard optimization techniques. In addition, we show that the required battery size is O(1\/ξ)) to constrain the performance of our scheme within ξ-neighborhood of the optimum. Through simulations with replenishment profile traces for solar and wind energy, we numerically evaluate our solution, which outperforms a state-of-the-art scheme that is developed based on the Lyapunov optimization technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10647","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10647","fieldValue":"A simple asymptotically optimal joint energy allocation and routing scheme in rechargeable sensor networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10648","fieldValue":" Reliable and accurate localization of mobile objects is essential for many applications in wireless networks. In range-based localization, the position of the object can be inferred using the distance measurements from wireless signals exchanged with active objects or reflected by passive ones. Power allocation for ranging signals is important since it affects not only network lifetime and throughput but also localization accuracy. In this paper, we establish a unifying optimization framework for power allocation in both active and passive localization networks. In particular, we first determine the functional properties of the localization accuracy metric, which enable us to transform the power allocation problems into second-order cone programs (SOCPs). We then propose the robust counterparts of the problems in the presence of parameter uncertainty and develop asymptotically optimal and efficient near-optimal SOCP-based algorithms. Our simulation results validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms."}
