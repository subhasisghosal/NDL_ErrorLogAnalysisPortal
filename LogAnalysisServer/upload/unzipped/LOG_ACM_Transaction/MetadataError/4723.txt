To support photographers in this task, we present similarity-based methods to cluster digital photos by time and image content. The approach is general and unsupervised, and makes minimal assumptions regarding the structure or statistics of the photo collection. We present several variants of an automatic unsupervised algorithm to partition a collection of digital photographs based either on temporal similarity alone, or on temporal and content-based similarity. First, interphoto similarity is quantified at multiple temporal scales to identify likely event clusters. Second, the final clusters are determined according to one of three clustering goodness criteria. The clustering criteria trade off computational complexity and performance. We also describe a supervised clustering method based on learning vector quantization. Finally, we review the results of an experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms and existing approaches on two test collections."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25247","fieldValue":" Transcoding is a promising technology that allows systems to effect a quality-versus-size tradeoff on multimedia objects. As audio and video applications have proliferated on the Internet, caching in transcoding proxies has become an important technique for improving network performance, especially in mobile networks. This article addresses the problem of coordinated enroute multimedia object caching in transcoding proxies for tree networks. We formulate this problem as an optimization problem based on our proposed model, in which multimedia object caching decisions are made on all enroute caches along the routing path by integrating both object placement and replacement policies and cache status information along the routing path of a request is used to determine the optimal locations for caching multiple versions of the same multimedia object. We propose an optimal solution using dynamic programming to compute the optimal locations. We also extend this solution to solve the same problem for several constrained cases, including constraints on the cost gain per node and on the number of versions to be placed. Our model is evaluated on different performance metrics through extensive simulation experiments. The implementation results show that our model significantly outperforms existing models that consider Web caching in transcoding proxies either on a single path or at individual nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25247","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25247","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25248","fieldValue":" New TCP-friendly constraints require multimedia flows to reduce their data rates under packet loss to that of a conformant TCP flow. To reduce data rates while preserving real-time playout, temporal scaling can be used to discard the encoded multimedia frames that have the least impact on perceived video quality. To limit the impact of lost packets, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be used to repair frames damaged by packet loss. However, adding FEC requires further reduction of multimedia data, making the decision of how much FEC to use of critical importance. Current approaches use either inflexible FEC patterns or adapt to packet loss on the network without regard to TCP-friendly data rate constraints. In this article, we analytically model the playable frame rate of a TCP-friendly MPEG stream with FEC and temporal scaling, capturing the impact of distributing FEC within MPEG frame types with interframe dependencies. For a given network condition and MPEG video encoding, we use our model to exhaustively search for the optimal combination of FEC and temporal scaling that yields the highest playable frame rate within TCP-friendly constraints. Analytic experiments over a range of network and application conditions indicate that adjustable FEC with temporal scaling can provide a significant performance improvement over current approaches. Extensive simulation experiments based on Internet traces show that our model can be effective as part of a streaming protocol that chooses FEC and temporal scaling patterns that meet dynamically-changing application and network conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25248","fieldValue":"MPEG"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25248","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25248","fieldValue":"ACM"}
