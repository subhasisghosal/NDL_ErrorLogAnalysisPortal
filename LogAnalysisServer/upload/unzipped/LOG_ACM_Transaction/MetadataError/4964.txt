However, the performance of SMA-based signal processing algorithms ultimately depends on the physical characteristics of the array. In particular, the range of frequencies over which an SMA provide rich spatial information is conditioned by the size of the array, the angular position of the sensors and other factors. In this work, we investigate the design of SMAs offering a wider frequency range of operation than that offered by conventional designs. To achieve this goal, microphones are distributed both on and at a distance from the surface of a rigid spherical baffle. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we present a general framework for modeling SMAs whose sensors are located at different distances from the array center and calculating optimal filters for the decomposition of the sound field into spherical harmonic modes. Second, we present an optimization method to design multi-radius SMAs with an optimally wide frequency range of operation given the total number of sensors available and target spatial resolution. Lastly, based on the optimization results, we built a prototype dual-radius SMA with 64 microphones. We present measurement results for the prototype microphone array and compare these results with theory."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3599","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3599","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3600","fieldValue":" Measuring the Room Impulse Responses within a finite 3D spatial domain can require a very large number of measurements with standard uniform sampling. In this paper, we show that, at low frequencies, this sampling can be done with significantly less measurements, using some modal properties of the room. At a given temporal frequency, a plane wave approximation of the acoustic field leads to a sparse approximation, and therefore a compressed sensing framework can be used for its acquisition. This paper describes three different sparse models that can be constructed, and the corresponding estimation algorithms: two models that exploit the structured sparsity of the soundfield, with projections of the modes onto plane waves sharing the same wavenumber, and one that computes a sparse decomposition on a dictionary of independent plane waves with time \/ space variable separation. These models are compared numerically and experimentally, with an array of 120 microphones irregularly placed within a 2 Ã\u20142 Ã\u20142 m volume inside a room, with an approximate uniform distribution. One of the most challenging part is the design of estimation algorithms whose computational complexity remains tractable."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1271","fieldValue":" Autonomic server provisioning for performance assurance is a critical issue in Internet services. It is challenging to guarantee that requests flowing through a multi-tier system will experience an acceptable distribution of delays. The difficulty is mainly due to highly dynamic workloads, the complexity of underlying computer systems, and the lack of accurate performance models. We propose a novel autonomic server provisioning approach based on a model-independent self-adaptive Neural Fuzzy Control (NFC). Existing model-independent fuzzy controllers are designed manually on a trial-and-error basis, and are often ineffective in the face of highly dynamic workloads. NFC is a hybrid of control-theoretical and machine learning techniques. It is capable of self-constructing its structure and adapting its parameters through fast online learning. We further enhance NFC to compensate for the effect of server switching delays. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, compared to a rule-based fuzzy controller and a Proportional-Integral controller, the NFC-based approach delivers superior performance assurance in the face of highly dynamic workloads. It is robust to variation in workload intensity, characteristics, delay target, and server switching delays. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the NFC-based approach with a testbed implementation in virtualized blade servers hosting a multi-tier online auction benchmark."}
