Existing word prediction systems predict a word when a user correctly enters the initial few characters of the word. In fact, a word prediction system fails if the user makes errors in the initial input. Therefore, there is a need to develop a word prediction system that predicts desired words while coping with errors in initial entries. This requirement is more relevant in the case of text entry in Indian languages, which are involved with a large set of alphabets, words with complex characters and inflections, phonetically similar sets of characters, etc. In fact, text composition in Indian languages involves frequent spelling errors, which presents a challenge to develop an efficient word prediction system. In this article, we address this problem and propose a novel word prediction system. Our proposed approach has been tried with Hindi, the national language of India. Experiments with users substantiate 43.77&percnt; keystroke savings, 92.49&percnt; hit rate, and 95.82&percnt; of prediction utilization with the proposed word prediction system. Our system also reduces the spelling error by 89.75&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3039","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3039","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21397","fieldValue":" In this article, we consider the problem faced by a sensor network operator who must infer, in real time, the value of some environmental parameter that is being monitored at discrete points in space and time by a sensor network. We describe a powerful and generic approach built upon an efficient multi-output Gaussian process that facilitates this information acquisition and processing. Our algorithm allows effective inference even with minimal domain knowledge, and we further introduce a formulation of Bayesian Monte Carlo to permit the principled management of the hyperparameters introduced by our flexible models. We demonstrate how our methods can be applied in cases where the data is delayed, intermittently missing, censored, and\/or correlated. We validate our approach using data collected from three networks of weather sensors and show that it yields better inference performance than both conventional independent Gaussian processes and the Kalman filter. Finally, we show that our formalism efficiently reuses previous computations by following an online update procedure as new data sequentially arrives, and that this results in a four-fold increase in computational speed in the largest cases considered."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21397","fieldValue":"Real-time information processing of environmental sensor network data using bayesian gaussian processes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21398","fieldValue":" The low-powered transmissions in a wireless sensor network (WSN) are highly susceptible to interference from external sources. Our work is a step towards enabling WSN devices to better understand the interference in their environment so that they can adapt to it and communicate more efficiently. We extend our previous work in which we collected received signal strength traces using mote-class synchronized receivers at sample rates that are, to the best of our knowledge, higher than previously described in the literature. These traces contain distinct interference patterns, each with a different potential for being exploited by cognitive radio strategies. In order to exploit a pattern, however, a node must first recognize it. Given the energy and space constraints of a node, we explore succinct decision tree classifiers for the two most disruptive patterns. We expand on a basic feature set to incorporate attributes based on the dip statistic and the Lomb periodogram, both of which address specific, empirically observed behaviour, and we show their positive impact on both the decision tree structure and the overall classification performance. Moreover, we present an approximation of the periodogram that makes its construction feasible for mote-class devices, and we describe the simplification's impact on classification performance."}
