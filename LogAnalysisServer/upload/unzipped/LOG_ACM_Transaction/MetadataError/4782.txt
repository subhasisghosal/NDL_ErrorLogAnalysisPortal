These applications typically create large repositories of motion capture data and need efficient and accurate content-based retrieval techniques. 3D motion capture data is in the form of multidimensional time-series data. To reduce the dimensions of human motion data while maintaining semantically important features, we quantize human motion data by extracting spatio-temporal features through SVD and translate them onto a symbolic sequential representation through our proposed sGMMEM (semantic Gaussian Mixture Modeling with EM). In order to handle variations in motion capture data due to human body characteristics and speed of motion, we transform the semantically quantized values into a histogram representation. This representation is used as a signature for classification and similarity-based retrieval. We achieved good classification accuracies for â\u20ACœcoarseâ\u20AC? human motion categories (such as walking 92.85&percnt;, run 91.42&percnt;, and jump 94.11&percnt;) and even for subtle categories (such as dance 89.47&percnt;, laugh 83.33&percnt;, basketball signal 85.71&percnt;, golf putting 80.00&percnt;). Experiments also demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms earlier techniques such as the wMSV (weighted Motion Singular Vector) approach and LB_Keogh method."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25394","fieldValue":"EM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25394","fieldValue":"EM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25394","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25394","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25395","fieldValue":" 3D triangular meshes are becoming an increasingly prevalent data type in networked applications such as digital museums, online games, and virtual worlds. In these applications, a 3D mesh is typically coded progressively, yielding a multiresolution representation suitable for streaming. While such progressive coding allows incremental rendering for users while data is being transmitted, it introduces dependencies between data, causing delay in rendering when packets are lost. This article quantitatively analyzes the effects of such dependency by modeling the distribution of decoding time as a function of mesh properties and network parameters. We apply our model to study two extreme cases of dependency in progressive meshes and show that the effect of dependencies on decoded mesh quality diminishes with time. Our model provides the expected decoded mesh quality at the receiver at a given time. Based on this expected value, we propose a packetization strategy that improves the decoded mesh quality during the initial stage of streaming. We validate the accuracy of our model under a variety of network conditions, including bursty losses, fluctuating RTT, and varying sending rate. The values predicted from our model match the measured value reasonably well in all cases except when losses are too bursty."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25396","fieldValue":" The QoS-aware delivery model of multimedia is an interesting research area. The wireless networking systems connecting mobile clients and media servers have created the paradigm of mobile multimedia. In mobile multimedia systems, the media delivery model has to maintain two diagonally opposite objectives, such as maintaining QoS of playback and saving energy consumption of the mobile devices. The traditional pull, push, and the hybrid push-pull models of media delivery are not completely suitable to offer consistent QoS of playback while saving the energy consumptions at mobile devices. This article proposes a novel multimedia delivery system based on the Fuzzy Adaptive Buffering (FAB) algorithm using pull model. The FAB algorithm employs a fuzzy inference technique and dynamically adapts to the execution environments. The experimental results illustrate that the FAB algorithm successfully adapts to dynamic execution contexts while maintaining playback-QoS and saving the energy consumption of the mobile clients by keeping the data prefetching thread in the sleeping mode from 31.44&percnt; to 97.4&percnt; of streaming time depending on the execution environments."}
