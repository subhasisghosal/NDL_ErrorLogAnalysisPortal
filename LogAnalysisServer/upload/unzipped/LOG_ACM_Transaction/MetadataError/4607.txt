The goal is to find systems whose expected performance measures are larger or smaller than a single system referred to as a standard and, if there is any, to find the one with the largest or smallest performance. The general formulation of comparison with a standard gives the standard a special status and tries to protect it when its performance is better than or even equal to performance measures of all the other alternatives. Therefore, the problem cannot be formulated as the selection of the best and a specialized procedure is required. Our procedures allow for unequal variances across systems, the use of common random numbers, and known or unknown expected performance of the standard. Experimental results are provided to compare the efficiency of the procedure with other existing procedures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24907","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24907","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24908","fieldValue":"Thng, Ian Li-Jin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24908","fieldValue":" This article describes a new priority queue implementation for managing the pending event set in discrete event simulation. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms other current popular candidates. This new implementation, called Ladder Queue, is also theoretically justified to have O(1) amortized access time complexity, as long as the mean jump parameter of the priority increment distribution is finite and greater than zero, regardless of its variance. Many practical priority increment distributions satisfy this condition including unbounded variance distributions like the Pareto distribution. This renders the LadderQ the ideal discrete event queue structure for stable O(1) performance even under practical queue distributions with infinite variance. Numerical simulations ranging from 100 to 10 million events affirm the O(1) property of LadderQ and that it is a superior structure for large-scale discrete event simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24908","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24908","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24909","fieldValue":" The acceptance\/rejection approach is widely used in universal nonuniform random number generators. Its key part is an accurate approximation of a given probability density from above by a hat function. This article uses a piecewise constant hat function, whose values are overestimates of the density on the elements of the partition of the domain. It uses a sawtooth overestimate of Lipschitz continuous densities, and then examines all local maximizers of such an overestimate. The method is applicable to multivariate multimodal distributions. It exhibits relatively short preprocessing time and fast generation of random variates from a very large class of distributions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24909","fieldValue":"ACM"}
