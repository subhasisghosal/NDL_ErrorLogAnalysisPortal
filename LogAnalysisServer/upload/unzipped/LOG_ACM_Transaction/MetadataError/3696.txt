When scarce parallel corpus is available, RBMT becomes particularly attractive. This is the case of the Chinese--Spanish language pair. This article presents the first RBMT system for Chinese to Spanish. We describe a hybrid method for constructing this system taking advantage of available resources such as parallel corpora that are used to extract dictionaries and lexical and structural transfer rules. The final system is freely available online and open source. Although performance lags behind standard SMT systems for an in-domain test set, the results show that the RBMTâ\u20AC™s coverage is competitive and it outperforms the SMT system in an out-of-domain test set. This RBMT system is available to the general public, it can be further enhanced, and it opens up the possibility of creating future hybrid MT systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3094","fieldValue":"Description of the Chinese-to-Spanish Rule-Based Machine Translation System Developed Using a Hybrid Combination of Human Annotation and Statistical Techniques"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21906","fieldValue":" Multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) are becoming a popular design choice in current and future technology nodes to accommodate the heterogeneous computing demand of a multitude of applications enabled on these platform. Streaming multimedia and other communication-centric applications constitute a significant fraction of the application space of these devices. The mapping of an application on an MPSoC is an NP-hard problem. This has attracted researchers to solve this problem both as stand-alone (best-effort) and in conjunction with other optimization objectives, such as energy and reliability. Most existing studies on energy-reliability joint optimization are staticâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, design time based. These techniques fail to capture runtime variability such as resource unavailability and dynamism associated with application behaviors, which are typical of multimedia applications. The few studies that consider dynamic mapping of applications do not consider throughput degradation, which directly impacts user satisfaction. This article proposes a runtime technique to analyze the execution trace of an application modeled as Synchronous Data Flow Graphs (SDFGs) to determine its mapping on a multiprocessor system with heterogeneous processing units for different fault scenarios. Further, communication energy is minimized for each of these mappings while satisfying the throughput constraint. Experiments conducted with synthetic and real SDFGs demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves significant improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of throughput and storage overhead with less than 20&percnt; energy overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21906","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21906","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21907","fieldValue":" With an increasing number of processing elements (PEs) integrated on a single chip, fault-tolerant techniques are critical to ensure the reliability of such complex systems. In current reconfigurable architectures, redundant PEs are utilized for fault tolerance. In the presence of faulty PEs, the physical topologies of various chips may be different, so the concept of virtual topology from network embedding problem has been used to alleviate the burden for the operating systems. With limited hardware resources, how to reconfigure a system into the most effective virtual topology such that the maximum repair rate can be reached presents a significant challenge. In this article, a new approach using a maximum flow (MF) algorithm is proposed for an efficient topology reconfiguration in reconfigurable architectures. In this approach, topology reconfiguration is converted into a network flow problem by constructing a directed graph; the solution is then found by using the MF algorithm. This approach optimizes the use of spare PEs with minimal impacts on area, throughput, and delay, and thus it significantly improves the repair rate of faulty PEs. In addition, it achieves a polynomial reconfiguration time. Experimental results show that compared to previous methods, the MF approach increases the probability to repair faulty PEs by up to 50&percnt; using the same redundant resources. Compared to a fault-free system, the throughput only decreases by less than 2.5&percnt; and latency increases by less than 4&percnt;. To consider various types of PEs in a practical application, a cost factor is introduced into the MF algorithm. An enhanced approach using a minimum-cost MF algorithm is further shown to be efficient in the fault-tolerant reconfiguration of heterogeneous reconfigurable architectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21907","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21907","fieldValue":"ACM"}
