Our methods are based on a traditional design drawing style known as analytic drawing, which supports precise image-space construction of a linear 3D scaffold. This scaffold in turn acts as a set of visual constraints for sketching 3D curves. We implement analytic drawing techniques in a pure-inference sketching interface which supports both single-and multi-view incremental construction of complex scaffolds and curve networks. A new representation of 3D drawings is proposed, and useful interactive drawing aids are described. Novel techniques are presented for deriving constraints from single-view sketches drawn relative to the current 3D scaffold, and then inferring 3D line and curve geometry which satisfies these constraints. The resulting analytic drawing tool allows 3D drawings to be constructed using exactly the same strokes as one would make on paper."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16188","fieldValue":" We present DiagSplit, a parallel algorithm for adaptively tessellating displaced parametric surfaces into high-quality, crack-free micropolygon meshes. DiagSplit modifies the split-dice tessellation algorithm to allow splits along non-isoparametric directions in the surface's parametric domain, and uses a dicing scheme that supports unique tessellation factors for each subpatch edge. Edge tessellation factors are computed using only information local to subpatch edges. These modifications allow all subpatches generated by DiagSplit to be processed independently without introducing T-junctions or mesh cracks and without incurring the tessellation overhead of binary dicing. We demonstrate that DiagSplit produces output that is better (in terms of image quality and number of micropolygons produced) than existing parallel tessellation schemes, and as good as highly adaptive split-dice implementations that are less amenable to parallelization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16188","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16188","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16189","fieldValue":" We present a new method for approximating subdivision surfaces with hardware accelerated parametric patches. Our method improves the memory bandwidth requirements for patch control points, translating into superior performance compared to existing methods. Our input is general, allowing for meshes that contain both quadrilateral and triangular faces in the input control mesh, as well as control meshes with boundary. We present two implementations of our scheme designed to run on Direct3D 11 class hardware equipped with a tessellator unit."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16189","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16189","fieldValue":"ACM"}
