The state-of-the-art emergency response systems rely on satellite radio-enabled devices, but survivors, unlike first responders, do not have access to such devices. To mitigate this problem, we present perpetuu, a solar-powered portable GIS microserver. The microserver node can be deployed in a disaster scene and can serve maps to survivors viewable on browsers of off-the-shelf mobile systems. The perpetuu nodes can form a wireless mesh to cover a large geographic region. A key innovation in the design of the perpetuu node is a tiered software and hardware architectureâ\u20AC\u201Dthe system combines a low-power micro-controller with a high-power micro-processor to provide a large spectrum of power states. perpetuu stays in its lowest power state most of the time, and it can in-vitro detect survivors using Wi-Fi sensing, and consequently wake up the higher-power tier to disseminate high-resolution maps on standard web browsers that provide directions to safe locations. The tiered design leverages hardware-assisted energy measurements and a wakeup controller to balance energy harvested from solar panels with energy consumed by the system. We evaluate perpetuu using measurements from our prototype and trace-based simulations, and show that it can function near-perpetually while serving maps to a large number of survivors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6957","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6957","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6958","fieldValue":" The goal of runtime monitoring is to inspect the well-being of a system by employing a monitor process that reads the state of the system during execution and evaluates a set of properties expressed in some specification language. The main challenge in runtime monitoring is dealing with the costs imposed in terms of resource utilization. In the context of cyber-physical systems, it is crucial for a software monitoring solution to be time predictable to improve scheduling, as well as support composition of monitoring solutions with an overall predictable behavior. Moreover, a small memory footprint is often required in components of cyber-physical systems, especially in deeply embedded systems. In this article, we propose a novel control-theoretic software monitoring solution for coordinating time predictability and memory utilization in runtime monitoring of systems that interact with the physical world. The controllers attempt to reduce monitoring jitter and maximize memory utilization while simultaneously ensuring the soundness of evaluation of properties. For systems where multiple properties are required to be monitored simultaneously, we construct a buffer sharing mechanism in which controllers dynamically share the memory space to negate the effect of bursts of environment actions, thus reducing jitter due to transient high loads. To validate our design choices, we present three case studies: (1) a Bluetooth mobile payment system, which shows a sporadic rate of events during peak hours; (2) a laser beam stabilizer for target tracking, and (3) a monitoring system for air\/fuel ratio in a car engine exhaust and the CAM inlet position in the engineâ\u20AC™s cylinders. The experimental results of the case studies demonstrate up to 40&percnt; improvement in time predictability of the monitoring solution when compared to a basic event-triggered approach. Moreover, memory utilization reaches an average of 90&percnt; when using our dynamic buffer resizing mechanism."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6959","fieldValue":"Gebotys, Catherine H"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6959","fieldValue":"White, Brian A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6959","fieldValue":" Future wireless embedded devices will be increasingly powerful, supporting many more applications including one of the most crucial, security. Although many embedded devices offer resistance to bus probing attacks due to their compact size and high levels of integration, susceptibility to attacks on their electromagnetic side channel must be analyzed. This side channel is often quite complex to analyze due to the complexities of the embedded device including operating system, interrupts, and so forth. This article presents a new methodology for analyzing a complex system's vulnerability to the EM side channel. The methodology proposes a sliding window phase-only correlation method for aligning electromagnetic emanations from a complex smartphone running native code utilizing an on-chip cache. Unlike previous research, experimental results demonstrate that data written to on-chip cache within an advanced 312MHz 0.13um processor executing AES can be attacked utilizing this new methodology. Furthermore, for the first time, it has been shown that the point of side-channel attack is not a spike of increased EM but an area of low EM amplitude, unlike what is noted in previous findings. This research is important for advancing side-channel analysis understanding in complex embedded processors and ensuring secure implementations in future embedded ubiquitous devices."}
