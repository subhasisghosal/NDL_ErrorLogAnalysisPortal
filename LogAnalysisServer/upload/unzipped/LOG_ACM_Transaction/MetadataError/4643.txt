We first present a generic procedure that detects the feasibility of one system in the presence of one constraint and extend it to the case of two or more systems and constraints. To accelerate the elimination of infeasible systems, a method that reuses collected observations and its variance-updating version are discussed. Experimental results are presented to compare the performance of the proposed procedures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25002","fieldValue":" Agent-based business process simulation has grown in popularity, in part because of its analysis capabilities. The analyses depend on the kinds of simulations that can be built, adapted, and extended, which in turn depend on the underlying simulation framework. We report the results of our analysis of 19 agent-based process simulation tools and their simulation frameworks. We conclude that a growing number of simulation tools are using component-based software techniques. Nevertheless, most simulation tools do not directly support requirements models, their transformation into executable simulations, or the management of model variants over time. Such practices are becoming more widely applied in software engineering under the term software product line engineering (SPLE). Based on our analysis, agent-based process simulation tools may improve their customization capacity by: (1) supporting object modeling more completely and (2) supporting software product line engineering issues."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25003","fieldValue":" This article considers importance sampling as a tool for rare-event simulation. The focus is on estimating the probability of overflow in the downstream queue of a Jacksonian two-node tandem queue; it is known that in this setting â\u20ACœtraditionalâ\u20AC? state-independent importance-sampling distributions perform poorly. We therefore concentrate on developing a state-dependent change of measure, that we prove to be asymptotically efficient. More specific contributions are the following. (i) We concentrate on the probability of the second queue exceeding a certain predefined threshold before the system empties. Importantly, we identify an asymptotically efficient importance-sampling distribution for any initial state of the system. (ii) The choice of the importance-sampling distribution is backed up by appealing heuristics that are rooted in large-deviations theory. (iii) The method for proving asymptotic efficiency relies on probabilistic arguments only. The article is concluded by simulation experiments that show a considerable speedup."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25004","fieldValue":" The field of game theory has proved to be of great importance in modeling interactions between self-interested parties in a variety of settings. Traditionally, game-theoretic analysis relied on highly stylized models to provide interesting insights about problems at hand. The shortcoming of such models is that they often do not capture vital detail. On the other hand, many real strategic settings, such as sponsored search auctions and supply-chains, can be modeled in high resolution using simulations. Recently, a number of approaches have been introduced to perform analysis of game-theoretic scenarios via simulation-based models. The first contribution of this work is the asymptotic analysis of Nash equilibria obtained from simulation-based models. The second contribution is to derive expressions for probabilistic bounds on the quality of Nash equilibrium solutions obtained using simulation data. In this vein, we derive very general distribution-free bounds, as well as bounds which rely on the standard normality assumptions, and extend the bounds to infinite games via Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we introduce a new maximum-a-posteriori estimator of Nash equilibria based on game-theoretic simulation data and show that it is consistent and almost surely unique."}
