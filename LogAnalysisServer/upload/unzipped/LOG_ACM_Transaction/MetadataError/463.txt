Each player seeks to communicate a message by choosing one of the links, and each player desires to minimize his experienced transmission time (latency). For evaluating the social cost of Nash equilibria, we consider the price of anarchy, which is the largest ratio of the cost of any Nash equilibrium compared to the optimum solution. Similarly, we consider the price of stability, which is the smallest ratio. The main purpose of this article is to quantify the influence of three parameters upon the prices of the game: the total traffic in the network; restrictions of the players in terms of link choice; and fluctuations in message lengths. Our main interest is to bound the sum of all player latencies, which we refer to as collective latency. For this cost, the prices of anarchy and stability are Î˜(n\/t), where n is the number of players and t the sum of message lengths (total traffic); that is, Nash equilibria approximate the optimum solution up to a constant factor if the traffic is high. If each player is restricted to choose from a subset of links, these link restrictions can cause a degradation in performance of order Î˜(\\sqrt{m}). The prices of anarchy and stability increase to Î˜(n\\sqrt{m}\/t). We capture fluctuations in message lengths through a stochastic model, in which we valuate Nash equilibria in terms of their expected price of anarchy. The expected price is Î˜(n\/\\mathbb{E}[T]), where \\mathbb{E}[T] is the expected traffic. The stochastic model resembles the deterministic one, even for the efficiency loss of order Î˜(\\sqrt{m}) for link restrictions. For the social cost function maximum latency, the (expected) price of anarchy is $1â\u20AC\u2030+â\u20AC\u2030m^2$\/t. In this case, Nash equilibria are almost optimal solutions for congested networks. Similar results hold when the cost function is a polynomial of the link loads."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12470","fieldValue":" Among a set of n coins of two weights (good and bad), and using a balance, we wish to determine the number of bad coins using as few measurements as possible. There is a known adaptive decision tree that answers this question in $O((log(n))^2$) measurements, and a slight modification of this decision tree determines the parity of the number of bad coins in O(logn). In this article, we prove an Î©(\\sqrt{n}) lower bound on the depth of any oblivious decision tree which solves either the counting or the parity problem. Our lower bound can also be applied to any function of high average sensitivity, which includes most random functions and most random symmetric functions. With a slight generalization of this result, we derive lower bounds for the size of threshold circuits for a wide class of Boolean functions. We demonstrate an exponential gap between the nonadaptive and adaptive coin-weighing complexities of the counting and parity problems. We prove a tight Î˜(logn) bound on the adaptive coin-weighing complexity of the parity problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12470","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12470","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12471","fieldValue":" The Group Isomorphism problem consists in deciding whether two input groups $G_1 and G2 given by their multiplication tables are isomorphic. We first give a 2-round Arthur-Merlin protocol for the Group Nonisomorphism problem such that on input groups (G1, G2$) of size n, Arthur uses $O(log^6 n) random bits and Merlin uses O(log2$ n) nondeterministic bits. We derandomize this protocol for the case of solvable groups showing the following two results: (a) We give a uniform NP machine for solvable Group Nonisomorphism, that works correctly on all but 2logO(1)(n) inputs of any length n. Furthermore, this NP machine is always correct when the input groups are nonisomorphic. The NP machine is obtained by an unconditional derandomization of the aforesaid AM protocol.
