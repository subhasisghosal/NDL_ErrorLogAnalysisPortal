{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4227","fieldValue":" Finding the causal genetic regions underlying complex traits is one of the main aims in human genetics. In the context of complex diseases, which are believed to be controlled by multiple contributing loci of largely unknown effect and position, it is especially important to develop general yet sensitive methods for gene mapping. We discuss the use of Shannon's information theory for population-based gene mapping of discrete and quantitative traits and for marker clustering. Various measures of mutual information were employed in order to develop a comprehensive framework for gene mapping analyses. An algorithm aimed at finding so-called relevance chains of causal markers is proposed. Moreover, entropy measures are used in conjunction with multidimensional scaling to visualize clusters of genetic markers. The relevance chain algorithm successfully detected the two causal regions in a simulated scenario. The approach has also been applied to a published clinical study on autoimmune (Graves') disease. Results were consistent with those of standard statistical methods, but identified an additional locus of interest in the promotor region of the associated gene CTLA4.

By appropriately choosing the system state, we can model transcriptional regulation by a hidden Markov model (HMM). This opens the possibility of using well-known techniques for the statistical analysis and stochastic control of HMMs to mathematically and computationally study transcriptional regulation in single cells. Unfortunately, in all but a few simple cases, analytical characterization of the statistical behavior of the proposed HMM is not possible. Moreover, analysis by Monte Carlo simulation is computationally cumbersome. We discuss several techniques for approximating the HMM by one that is more tractable. We employ simulations, based on a biologically relevant transcriptional regulatory system, to show the relative merits and limitations of various approximation techniques and provide general guidelines for their use."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4228","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4228","fieldValue":"Hidden Markov models, Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic biochemical systems, stochastic dynamical systems, transcriptional regulation, transcriptional regulatory systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4228","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4228","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4229","fieldValue":" Image and statistical analysis are two important stages of cDNA microarrays. Of these, gridding is necessary to accurately identify the location of each spot while extracting spot intensities from the microarray images and automating this procedure permits high-throughput analysis. Due to the deficiencies of the equipment used to print the arrays, rotations, misalignments, high contamination with noise and artifacts, and the enormous amount of data generated, solving the gridding problem by means of an automatic system is not trivial. Existing techniques to solve the automatic grid segmentation problem cover only limited aspects of this challenging problem and require the user to specify the size of the spots, the number of rows and columns in the grid, and boundary conditions. In this paper, a hill-climbing automatic gridding and spot quantification technique is proposed which takes a microarray image (or a subgrid) as input and makes no assumptions about the size of the spots, rows, and columns in the grid. The proposed method is based on a hill-climbing approach that utilizes different objective functions. The method has been found to effectively detect the grids on microarray images drawn from databases from GEO and the Stanford genomic laboratories."}
