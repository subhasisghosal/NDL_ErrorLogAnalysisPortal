We present video retargeting using an improved seam carving operator. Instead of removing 1D seams from 2D images we remove 2D seam manifolds from 3D space-time volumes. To achieve this we replace the dynamic programming method of seam carving with graph cuts that are suitable for 3D volumes. In the new formulation, a seam is given by a minimal cut in the graph and we show how to construct a graph such that the resulting cut is a valid seam. That is, the cut is monotonic and connected. In addition, we present a novel energy criterion that improves the visual quality of the retargeted images and videos. The original seam carving operator is focused on removing seams with the least amount of energy, ignoring energy that is introduced into the images and video by applying the operator. To counter this, the new criterion is looking forward in time - removing seams that introduce the least amount of energy into the retargeted result. We show how to encode the improved criterion into graph cuts (for images and video) as well as dynamic programming (for images). We apply our technique to images and videos and present results of various applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2506","fieldValue":" We study the parameterized complexity of the k-center problem on a given n-point set P in $&â\u201E?â\u201E?^d, with the dimension d as the parameter. We show that the rectilinear 3-center problem is fixed-parameter tractable, by giving an algorithm that runs in O(n log n) time for any fixed dimension d. On the other hand, we show that this is unlikely to be the case with both the Euclidean and rectilinear k-center problems for any kâ\u2030¥ 2 and k â\u2030¥ 4 respectively. In particular, we prove that deciding whether P can be covered by the union of 2 balls of given radius or by the union of 4 cubes of given side length is W[1]-hard with respect to d, and thus not fixed-parameter tractable unless FPT=W[1]. For the Euclidean case, we also show that even an no(d)-time algorithm does not exist, unless there is a 2o(n)$-time algorithm for n-variable 3SAT, that is, the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15889","fieldValue":"Rav-Acha, Alex"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15889","fieldValue":" We introduce a new representation for video which facilitates a number of common editing tasks. The representation has some of the power of a full reconstruction of 3D surface models from video, but is designed to be easy to recover from a priori unseen and uncalibrated footage. By modelling the image-formation process as a 2D-to-2D transformation from an object's texture map to the image, modulated by an object-space occlusion mask, we can recover a representation which we term the \"unwrap mosaic\". Many editing operations can be performed on the unwrap mosaic, and then re-composited into the original sequence, for example resizing objects, repainting textures, copying\/cutting\/pasting objects, and attaching effects layers to deforming objects."}
