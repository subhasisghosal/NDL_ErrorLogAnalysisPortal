It implements an asynchronous parallel pattern search method that has been specifically designed for problems characterized by expensive function evaluations. Using APPSPACK to solve optimization problems has several advantages: No derivative information is needed; the procedure for evaluating the objective function can be executed via a separate program or script; the code can be run serially or in parallel, regardless of whether the function evaluation itself is parallel; and the software is freely available. We describe the underlying algorithm, data structures, and features of APPSPACK version 4.0, as well as how to use and customize the software."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19146","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19146","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19147","fieldValue":"LEcuyer, Pierre"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19147","fieldValue":" We propose a fast algorithm for computing the inverse symmetrical beta distribution. Four series (two around x &equals; 0 and two around x &equals; 1\/2) are used to approximate the distribution function, and its inverse is found via Newton's method. This algorithm can be used to generate beta random variates by inversion and is much faster than currently available general inversion methods for the beta distribution. It turns out to be very useful for generating gamma processes efficiently via bridge sampling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19147","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19147","fieldValue":"ACM"}
