It balances workload by moving file sets among cluster server nodes. It responds to changing server resources that arise from failure and recovery, and dynamically adding or removing servers. It also realizes performance consistency---nearly uniform performance across all servers. The system is adaptive and self-tuning. It operates without any a priori knowledge of workload properties, or the capabilities of the servers. Rather, it continuously tunes load placement using a technique called adaptive, nonuniform (ANU) randomization. ANU randomization realizes the scalability and metadata reduction benefits of hash-based, randomized placement techniques, while avoiding hashing's drawbacks: load skew, inability to cope with heterogeneity, and lack of tunability. ANU randomization outperforms virtual-processor approaches to load balancing, while reducing the amount of shared state among servers and the amount of load movement."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20908","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20908","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20909","fieldValue":"Arpaci-Dusseau, Andrea C."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20909","fieldValue":"Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20909","fieldValue":" We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of D-GRAID, a gracefully degrading and quickly recovering RAID storage array. D-GRAID ensures that most files within the file system remain available even when an unexpectedly high number of faults occur. D-GRAID achieves high availability through aggressive replication of semantically critical data, and fault-isolated placement of logically related data. D-GRAID also recovers from failures quickly, restoring only live file system data to a hot spare. Both graceful degradation and live-block recovery are implemented in a prototype SCSI-based storage system underneath unmodified file systems, demonstrating that powerful â\u20ACœfile-system likeâ\u20AC? functionality can be implemented within a â\u20ACœsemantically smartâ\u20AC? disk system behind a narrow block-based interface."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20909","fieldValue":"RAID"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20909","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20909","fieldValue":"ACM"}
