{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16754","fieldValue":" Unsupervised co-analysis of a set of shapes is a difficult problem since the geometry of the shapes alone cannot always fully describe the semantics of the shape parts. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning method where the user actively assists in the co-analysis by iteratively providing inputs that progressively constrain the system. We introduce a novel constrained clustering method based on a spring system which embeds elements to better respect their inter-distances in feature space together with the user-given set of constraints. We also present an active learning method that suggests to the user where his input is likely to be the most effective in refining the results. We show that each single pair of constraints affects many relations across the set. Thus, the method requires only a sparse set of constraints to quickly converge toward a consistent and error-free semantic labeling of the set."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16755","fieldValue":" We present a co-abstraction method that takes as input a collection of 3D objects, and produces a mutually consistent and individually identity-preserving abstraction of each object. In general, an abstraction is a simpler version of a shape that preserves its main characteristics. We hypothesize, however, that there is no single abstraction of an object. Instead, there is a variety of possible abstractions, and an admissible one can only be chosen conjointly with other objects' abstractions. To this end, we introduce a new approach that hierarchically generates a spectrum of abstractions for each model in a shape collection. Given the spectra, we compute the appropriate abstraction level for each model such that shape simplification and inter-set consistency are collectively maximized, while individual shape identities are preserved."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16755","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16755","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16756","fieldValue":"Huang, Qi-Xing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16756","fieldValue":"Zhang, Guo-Xin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16756","fieldValue":"Hu, Shi-Min"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16756","fieldValue":" We introduce a novel approach for computing high quality point-to-point maps among a collection of related shapes. The proposed approach takes as input a sparse set of imperfect initial maps between pairs of shapes and builds a compact data structure which implicitly encodes an improved set of maps between all pairs of shapes. These maps align well with point correspondences selected from initial maps; they map neighboring points to neighboring points; and they provide cycle-consistency, so that map compositions along cycles approximate the identity map. The proposed approach is motivated by the fact that a complete set of maps between all pairs of shapes that admits nearly perfect cycle-consistency are highly redundant and can be represented by compositions of maps through a single base shape. In general, multiple base shapes are needed to adequately cover a diverse collection. Our algorithm sequentially extracts such a small collection of base shapes and creates correspondences from each of these base shapes to all other shapes. These correspondences are found by global optimization on candidate correspondences obtained by diffusing initial maps. These are then used to create a compact graphical data structure from which globally optimal cycle-consistent maps can be extracted using simple graph algorithms. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach yields significantly better results than state-of-the-art data-driven shape matching methods."}
