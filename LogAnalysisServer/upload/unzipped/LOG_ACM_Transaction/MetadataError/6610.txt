The more these records are collected, the better we can understand usersâ\u20AC™ mobility patterns and the more accurately we can predict their future locations. However, due to the personality trait of neophilia, people also show propensities of novelty seeking in human mobility, that is, exploring unvisited but tailored locations for them to visit. As such, the existing prediction algorithms, mainly relying on regular mobility patterns, face severe challenges because such behavior is beyond the reach of regularity. As a matter of fact, the prediction of this behavior not only relies on the forecast of novelty-seeking tendency but also depends on how to determine unvisited candidate locations. To this end, we put forward a Collaborative Exploration and Periodically Returning model (CEPR), based on a novel problem, Exploration Prediction (EP), which forecasts whether people will seek unvisited locations to visit, in the following. When people are predicted to do exploration, a state-of-the-art recommendation algorithm, armed with collaborative social knowledge and assisted by geographical influence, will be applied for seeking the suitable candidates; otherwise, a traditional prediction algorithm, incorporating both regularity and the Markov model, will be put into use for figuring out the most possible locations to visit. We then perform case studies on check-ins and evaluate them on two large-scale check-in datasets with 6M and 36M records, respectively. The evaluation results show that EP achieves a roughly 20&percnt; classification error rate on both datasets, greatly outperforming the baselines, and that CEPR improves performances by as much as 30&percnt; compared to the traditional location prediction algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7606","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7606","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7607","fieldValue":"Liu, Cheng-Lin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7607","fieldValue":"Zhao, Ming-Bo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7607","fieldValue":" In this article, we consider the problem of simultaneous low-rank recovery and sparse projection. More specifically, a new Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA)-based framework called Sparse Projection and Low-Rank Recovery (SPLRR) is proposed for handwriting representation and salient stroke feature extraction. In addition to achieving a low-rank component encoding principal features and identify errors or missing values from a given data matrix as RPCA, SPLRR also learns a similarity-preserving sparse projection for extracting salient stroke features and embedding new inputs for classification. These properties make SPLRR applicable for handwriting recognition and stroke correction and enable online computation. A cosine-similarity-style regularization term is incorporated into the SPLRR formulation for encoding the similarities of local handwriting features. The sparse projection and low-rank recovery are calculated from a convex minimization problem that can be efficiently solved in polynomial time. Besides, the supervised extension of SPLRR is also elaborated. The effectiveness of our SPLRR is examined by extensive handwritten digital repairing, stroke correction, and recognition based on benchmark problems. Compared with other related techniques, SPLRR delivers strong generalization capability and state-of-the-art performance for handwriting representation and recognition."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7607","fieldValue":"A Sparse Projection and Low-Rank Recovery Framework for Handwriting Representation and Salient Stroke Feature Extraction"}
