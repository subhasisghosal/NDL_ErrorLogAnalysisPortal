While developing naive code is straightforward, optimizing massively parallel applications requires deep understanding of the underlying architecture. The developer must struggle with complex index calculations and manual memory transfers. This article classifies memory access patterns used in most parallel algorithms, based on Berkeleyâ\u20AC™s Parallel â\u20ACœDwarfs.â\u20AC? It then proposes the MAPS framework, a device-level memory abstraction that facilitates memory access on GPUs, alleviating complex indexing using on-device containers and iterators. This article presents an implementation of MAPS and shows that its performance is comparable to carefully optimized implementations of real-world applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1950","fieldValue":"GPGPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10439","fieldValue":"Huang, Po-Kai"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10439","fieldValue":"Wang, Chih-Chun"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10439","fieldValue":" Quantifying the end-to-end delay performance in multihop wireless networks is a well-known challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new joint congestion control and scheduling algorithm for multihop wireless networks with fixed-route flows operated under a general interference model with interference degree Îº. Our proposed algorithm not only achieves a provable throughput guarantee (which is close to at least 1\/Îº of the system capacity region), but also leads to explicit upper bounds on the end-to-end delay of every flow. Our end-to-end delay and throughput bounds are in simple and closed forms, and they explicitly quantify the tradeoff between throughput and delay of every flow. Furthermore, the per-flow end-to-end delay bound increases linearly with the number of hops that the flow passes through, which is order-optimal with respect to the number of hops. Unlike traditional solutions based on the backpressure algorithm, our proposed algorithm combines window-based flow control with a new rate-based distributed scheduling algorithm. A key contribution of our work is to use a novel stochastic dominance approach to bound the corresponding per-flow throughput and delay, which otherwise are often intractable in these types of systems. Our proposed algorithm is fully distributed and requires a low per-node complexity that does not increase with the network size. Hence, it can be easily implemented in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10439","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
