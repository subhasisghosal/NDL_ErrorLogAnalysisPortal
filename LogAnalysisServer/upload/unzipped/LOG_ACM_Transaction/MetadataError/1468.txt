In addition an interactive technique is demonstrated for deforming these black-and-white facial illustrations to create caricatures which highlight and exaggerate representative facial features. We evaluate the effectiveness of the resulting images through psychophysical studies to assess accuracy and speed in both recognition and learning tasks. These studies show that the facial illustrations and caricatures generated using our techniques are as effective as photographs in recognition tasks. For the learning task we find that illustrations are learned two times faster than photographs and caricatures are learned one and a half times faster than photographs. Because our techniques produce images that are effective at communicating complex information, they are useful in a number of potential applications, ranging from entertainment and education to low bandwidth telecommunications and psychology research."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15487","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15487","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15488","fieldValue":" There are a number of applications in computer graphics that require as a first step the accurate estimation of principal direction vectors at arbitrary vertices on a triangulated surface. Although several methods for calculating principal directions over such models have been previously proposed, we have found in practice that all exhibit unexplained large errors in some cases. In this article, we describe our theoretical and experimental investigations into possible sources of errors in the approximation of principal direction vectors from triangular meshes, and suggest a new method for estimating principal directions that can yield better results under some circumstances."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15488","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15488","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15489","fieldValue":" An important problem in the area of computer graphics is the visualization of large, complex information spaces. Datasets of this type have grown rapidly in recent years, both in number and in size. Images of the data stored in these collections must support rapid and accurate exploration and analysis. This article presents a method for constructing visualizations that are both effective and aesthetic. Our approach uses techniques from master paintings and human perception to visualize a multidimensional dataset. Individual data elements are drawn with one or more brush strokes that vary their appearance to represent the element's attribute values. The result is a nonphotorealistic visualization of information stored in the dataset. Our research extends existing glyph-based and nonphotorealistic techniques by applying perceptual guidelines to build an effective representation of the underlying data. The nonphotorealistic properties the strokes employ are selected from studies of the history and theory of Impressionist art. We show that these properties are similar to visual features that are detected by the low-level human visual system. This correspondence allows us to manage the strokes to produce perceptually salient visualizations. Psychophysical experiments confirm a strong relationship between the expressive power of our nonphotorealistic properties and previous findings on the use of perceptual color and texture patterns for data display. Results from these studies are used to produce effective nonphotorealistic visualizations. We conclude by applying our techniques to a large, multidimensional weather dataset to demonstrate their viability in a practical, real-world setting."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15489","fieldValue":"ACM"}
