We show that such information gives additional insights into the nature of the structures and\/or biological functions of these objects, leading to valuable knowledge for subcategorization of protein families by the properties that the involved proteins do not have in common. Based on the observation that the expressions of negation employ mostly predictable syntactic structures that can be characterized by subclausal coordination and by clause-level parallelism, we present a system that extracts such contrastive information by identifying those syntactic structures with natural language processing techniques and with additional linguistic resources for semantics. The implemented system shows the performance of 85.7&percnt; precision and 61.5&percnt; recall, including 7.7&percnt; partial recall, or an F score of 76.6. We apply the system to the biological interactions as extracted by our biomedical information-extraction system in order to enrich proteome databases with contrastive information."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2896","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2896","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19806","fieldValue":"Tai, Kou-Chung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19806","fieldValue":" Two noncanonical extensions of the simple LR(1) (SLR(1)) method are presented, which reduce not only handles but also other phrases of sentential forms. A class of context-free grammars called leftmost SLR(1) (LSLR(1)) is defined by using lookahead symbols which appear in leftmost derivations. This class includes the SLR(1), reflected SMSP, and total precedence grammars as proper subclasses. The class of LSLR(1) languages properly includes the deterministic context-free languages, their reflections, and total precedence languages. By requiring that phrases which have been scanned be reduced as early as possible, a larger class of context-free grammars called noncanonical SLR(1) (NSLR(1)) is defined. The NSLR(1) languages can be recognized deterministically in linear time using a two-stack pushdown automaton. An NSLR(1) parser generator has been implemented. Empirical results show that efficient NSLR(1) parsers can be constructed for some non-LR grammars which generate nondeterministic languages. Applications of the NSLR(1) method to improve the parsing and translation of programming languages are discussed."}
