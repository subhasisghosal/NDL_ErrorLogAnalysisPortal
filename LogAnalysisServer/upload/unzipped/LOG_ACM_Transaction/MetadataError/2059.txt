We formalize this process as projecting from a high-dimensional feature space into a 2D layout. Our system does not expose the control of this projection to the user in form of sliders or similar interfaces. Instead, we infer the desired layout of all primitives from interactive placement of a small subset of example primitives. To produce a pleasant distribution of primitives with spatial extend, we propose a novel generalization of Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation which equalizes the distances between boundaries of nearby primitives. Compared to previous primitive distribution approaches our GPU implementation achieves both better fidelity and asymptotically higher speed. A user study evaluates the system's usability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17000","fieldValue":"McCosker, Michael"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17000","fieldValue":" There is currently significant interest in freeform, curve-based authoring of graphic images. In particular, \"diffusion curves\" facilitate graphic image creation by allowing an image designer to specify naturalistic images by drawing curves and setting colour values along either side of those curves. Recently, extensions to diffusion curves based on the biharmonic equation have been proposed which provide smooth interpolation through specified colour values and allow image designers to specify colour gradient constraints at curves. We present a Boundary Element Method (BEM) for rendering diffusion curve images with smooth interpolation and gradient constraints, which generates a solved boundary element image representation. The diffusion curve image can be evaluated from the solved representation using a novel and efficient line-by-line approach. We also describe \"curve-aware\" upsampling, in which a full resolution diffusion curve image can be upsampled from a lower resolution image using formula evaluated orrections near curves. The BEM solved image representation is compact. It therefore offers advantages in scenarios where solved image representations are transmitted to devices for rendering and where PDE solving at the device is undesirable due to time or processing constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17001","fieldValue":" We propose near-eye light field displays that enable thin, lightweight head-mounted displays (HMDs) capable of presenting nearly correct convergence, accommodation, binocular disparity, and retinal defocus depth cues. Sharp images are depicted by out-of-focus elements by synthesizing light fields corresponding to virtual objects within a viewer's natural accommodation range. We formally assess the capabilities of microlens arrays to achieve practical near-eye light field displays. Building on concepts shared with existing integral imaging displays and light field cameras, we optimize performance in the context of near-eye viewing. We establish fundamental trade-offs between the quantitative parameters of resolution, field of view, and depth of field, as well as the ergonomic parameters of form factor and ranges of allowed eye movement. As with light field cameras, our design supports continuous accommodation of the eye throughout a finite depth of field; as a result, binocular configurations provide a means to address the accommodation-convergence conflict occurring with existing stereoscopic displays. We construct a complete prototype display system, comprising: a custom-fabricated HMD using modified off-the-shelf parts and real-time, GPU-accelerated light field renderers (including a general ray tracing method and a \"backward compatible\" rasterization method supporting existing stereoscopic content). Through simulations and experiments, we motivate near-eye light field displays as thin, lightweight alternatives to conventional near-eye displays."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17001","fieldValue":"ACM"}
