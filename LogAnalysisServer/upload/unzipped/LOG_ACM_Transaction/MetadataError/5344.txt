Filters make use of statistical properties of each gene to represent its discriminating power between different classes. The computation is fast but the predictions are inaccurate. Wrappers make use of a chosen classifier to select genes by maximizing classification accuracy, but the computation burden is formidable. Filters and wrappers have been combined in previous studies to maximize the classification accuracy for a chosen classifier with respect to a filtered set of genes. The drawback of this single-filter-single-wrapper (SFSW) approach is that the classification accuracy is dependent on the choice of specific filter and wrapper. In this paper, a multiple-filter-multiple-wrapper (MFMW) approach is proposed that makes use of multiple filters and multiple wrappers to improve the accuracy and robustness of the classification, and to identify potential biomarker genes. Experiments based on six benchmark data sets show that the MFMW approach outperforms SFSW models (generated by all combinations of filters and wrappers used in the corresponding MFMW model) in all cases and for all six data sets. Some of MFMW-selected genes have been confirmed to be biomarkers or contribute to the development of particular cancers by other studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4471","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4471","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4471","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4472","fieldValue":" A key problem in molecular biology is to infer regulatory relationships between genes from expression data. This paper studies a simplified model of such inference problems in which one or more Boolean variables, modeling, for example, the expression levels of genes, each depend deterministically on a small but unknown subset of a large number of Boolean input variables. Our model assumes that the expression data comprises a time series, in which successive samples may be correlated. We provide bounds on the expected amount of data needed to infer the correct relationships between output and input variables. These bounds improve and generalize previous results for Boolean network inference and continuous-time switching network inference. Although the computational problem is intractable in general, we describe a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm that is guaranteed to provide at least a partial solution to the problem. Most interestingly, both the sample complexity and computational complexity of the problem depend on the strength of correlations between successive samples in the time series but in opposing ways. Uncorrelated samples minimize the total number of samples needed while maximizing computational complexity; a strong correlation between successive samples has the opposite effect. This observation has implications for the design of experiments for measuring gene expression."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4472","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4472","fieldValue":"Machine learning, parameter learning, time-series analysis, feature extraction or construction, clustering, classification, association rules."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4472","fieldValue":"A Trade-Off between Sample Complexity and Computational Complexity in Learning Boolean Networks from Time-Series Data"}
