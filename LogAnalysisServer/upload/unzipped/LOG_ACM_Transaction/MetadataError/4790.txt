In our adult image-recognition algorithm, we model skin patches rather than skin pixels, resulting in better results than state-of-the-art algorithms which model skin pixels. In our adult video-recognition algorithm, information from the accompanying audio section around an image in an adult video is used to obtain a prior classification of the image. The algorithm achieves a better performance than the ones which use image information alone or audio information alone. The adult Web page bag recognition is carried out using multi-instance learning based on the combination of classifying texts, images and videos in Web pages. Both the speed and the accuracy for recognizing the Web adult content are increased, in contrast to recognizing Web pages one-by-one."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25413","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25413","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25414","fieldValue":"Lin, Yu-Ru"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25414","fieldValue":" We propose SCENT, an innovative, scalable spectral analysis framework for internet scale monitoring of multirelational social media data, encoded in the form of tensor streams. In particular, a significant challenge is to detect key changes in the social media data, which could reflect important events in the real world, sufficiently quickly. Social media data have three challenging characteristics. First, data sizes are enormous; recent technological advances allow hundreds of millions of users to create and share content within online social networks. Second, social data are often multifaceted (i.e., have many dimensions of potential interest, from the textual content to user metadata). Finally, the data is dynamic; structural changes can occur at multiple time scales and be localized to a subset of users. Consequently, a framework for extracting useful information from social media data needs to scale with data volume, and also with the number and diversity of the facets of the data. In SCENT, we focus on the computational cost of structural change detection in tensor streams. We extend compressed sensing (CS) to tensor data. We show that, through the use of randomized tensor ensembles, SCENT is able to encode the observed tensor streams in the form of compact descriptors. We show that the descriptors allow very fast detection of significant spectral changes in the tensor stream, which also reduce data collection, storage, and processing costs. Experiments over synthetic and real data show that SCENT is faster (17.7x--159x for change detection) and more accurate (above 0.9 F-score) than baseline methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25414","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25414","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25415","fieldValue":" The overwhelming amount of Web videos returned from search engines makes effective browsing and search a challenging task. Rather than conventional ranked list, it becomes necessary to organize the retrieved videos in alternative ways. In this article, we explore the issue of topic mining and organizing of the retrieved web videos in semantic clusters. We present a framework for clustering-based video retrieval and build a visualization user interface. A hierarchical topic structure is exploited to encode the characteristics of the retrieved video collection and a semi-supervised hierarchical topic model is proposed to guide the topic hierarchy discovery. Carefully designed experiments on web-scale video dataset collected from video sharing websites validate the proposed method and demonstrate that clustering-based video retrieval is practical to facilitate users for effective browsing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25415","fieldValue":"ACM"}
