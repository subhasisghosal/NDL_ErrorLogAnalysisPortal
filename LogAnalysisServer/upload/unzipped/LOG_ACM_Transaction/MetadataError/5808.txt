A DMFB reduces the rate of sample and reagent consumption, and automates the analysis of assays. In this paper, we provide the first assessment of the security vulnerabilities of DMFBs. We identify result-manipulation attacks on a DMFB that maliciously alter the assay outcomes. Two practical result-manipulation attacks are shown on a DMFB platform performing enzymatic glucose assay on serum. In the first attack, the attacker adjusts the concentration of the glucose sample and thereby modifies the final result. In the second attack, the attacker tampers with the calibration curve of the assay operation. We then identify denial-of-service attacks, where the attacker can disrupt the assay operation by tampering either with the droplet-routing algorithm or with the actuation sequence. We demonstrate these attacks using a digital microfluidic synthesis simulator. The results show that the attacks are easy to implement and hard to detect. Therefore, this work highlights the need for effective protections against malicious modifications in DMFBs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5321","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5321","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5321","fieldValue":"DMFB"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5322","fieldValue":" We present a modeling framework aimed at capturing both the positional and temporal behavior of transcriptional regulatory proteins in eukaryotic cells. There is growing evidence that transcriptional regulation is the complex behavior that emerges not solely from the individual components, but rather from their collective behavior, including competition and cooperation. Our framework describes individual regulatory components using generic action oriented descriptions of their biochemical interactions with a DNA sequence. All the possible actions are based on the current state of factors bound to the DNA. We developed a rule builder to automatically generate the complete set of biochemical interaction rules for any given DNA sequence. Off-the-shelf stochastic simulation engines can model the behavior of a system of rules and the resulting changes in the configuration of bound factors can be visualized. We compared our model to experimental data at well-studied loci in yeast, confirming that our model captures both the positional and temporal behavior of transcriptional regulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5322","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
