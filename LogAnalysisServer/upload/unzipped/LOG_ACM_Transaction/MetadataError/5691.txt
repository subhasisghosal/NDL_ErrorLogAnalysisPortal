Missing values are a common occurrence in both sequence and genotype data, but they make the problem of finding a perfect phylogeny NP-hard even for binary characters. We introduce new and efficient perfect phylogeny algorithms for broad classes of binary and multistate data with missing values. Specifically, we address binary missing data consistent with the rich data hypothesis (RDH) introduced by Halperin and Karp and give an efficient algorithm for enumerating phylogenies. This algorithm is useful for computing the probability of data with missing values under the coalescent model. In addition, we use the partition intersection (PI) graph and chordal graph theory to generalize the RDH to multi-state characters with missing values. For a bounded number of states, we provide a fixed parameter tractable algorithm for the perfect phylogeny problem with missing data. Utilizing the PI graph, we are able to show that under multiple biologically motivated models for character data, our generalized RDH holds with high probability, and we evaluate our results with extensive empirical analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5099","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1435","fieldValue":" The need for security features to stop spam and bots has prompted research aimed at developing human interaction proofs (HIPs) that are both secure and easy to use. The primarily visual techniques used in these HIP tools present difficulties for users with visual impairments. This article reports on the development of Human-Interaction Proof, Universally Usable (HIPUU), a new approach to human-interaction proofs based on identification of a series of sound\/image pairs. Simultaneous presentation of a single, unified task in two alternative modalities provides multiple paths to successful task completion. We present two alternative task completion strategies, based on differing input strategies (menu-based vs. free text entry). Empirical results from studies involving both blind and sighted users validate both the usability and accessibility of these differing strategies, with blind users achieving successful task completion rates above 90&percnt;. The strengths of the alternate task completion strategies are discussed, along with possible approaches for improving the robustness of HIPUU."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1435","fieldValue":"CAPTCHA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1435","fieldValue":"HIP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1435","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1435","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5100","fieldValue":"Campello, Ricardo J G B"}
