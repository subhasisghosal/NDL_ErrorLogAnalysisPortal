This problem can be solved by constructing the Voronoi diagram of the griven sites and then locating the query point inone of its regions. Two algorithms are given, one that constructs the Voronoi diagram in O(n log n) time, and another that inserts a new sit on O(n) time. Both are based on the use of the Voronoi dual, or Delaunay triangulation, and are simple enough to be of practical value. the simplicity of both algorithms can be attributed to the separation of the geometrical and topological aspects of the problem and to the use of two simple but powerful primitives, a geometric predicate and an operator for manipulating the topology of the diagram. The topology is represented by a new data structure for generalized diagrams, that is, embeddings of graphs in two-dimensional manifolds. This structure represents simultaneously an embedding, its dual, and its mirror image. Furthermore, just two operators are sufficients for building and modifying arbitrary diagrams."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2410","fieldValue":" Daniel Simon's 1994 discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for finding â\u20ACœhidden shiftsâ\u20AC? of $$Z_2^n provided the first algebraic problem for which quantum computers are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts. In this article, we study the generalization of Simon's problem to arbitrary groups. Fixing a finite group G, this is the problem of recovering an involution m &equals; (m1,â\u20AC¦,mn) âˆˆ Gn from an oracle f with the property that f(x á¹¡ y) &equals; f(x) â\u2021\u201D y âˆˆ {1, m}. In the current parlance, this is the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) over groups of the form Gn, where G is a nonabelian group of constant size, and where the hidden subgroup is either trivial or has order two. Although groups of the form Gn have a simple product structure, they share important representation--theoretic properties with the symmetric groups Sn, where a solution to the HSP would yield a quantum algorithm for Graph Isomorphism. In particular, solving their HSP with the so-called â\u20ACœstandard methodâ\u20AC? requires highly entangled measurements on the tensor product of many coset states. In this article, we provide quantum algorithms with time complexity 2O(&sqrt;n) that recover hidden involutions m &equals; (m1,â\u20AC¦mn) âˆˆ Gn$ where, as in Simon's problem, each mi$ is either the identity or the conjugate of a known element m which satisfies Îº(m) &equals; âˆ\u2019Îº(1) for some Îº âˆˆ Äœ. Our approach combines the general idea behind Kuperberg's sieve for dihedral groups with the â\u20ACœmissing harmonicâ\u20AC? approach of Moore and Russell. These are the first nontrivial HSP algorithms for group families that require highly entangled multiregister Fourier sampling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14953","fieldValue":" The degree of realism of the shaded image of a tree-dimensional scene depends on the successful simulation of shading effects. The shading model has two main ingredients, properties of the surface and properties of the illumination falling on it. Most previous work has concentrated on the former rather than the latter.This paper presents an improved version for generating scenes illuminated by point and linear light sources. The procedure can include intensity distributions for point light sources and output both umbrae and penumbrae for linear light sources, assuming thr environment is composed of convex polyhedra. This paper generalizes Crow's procedure for computing shadow volumes caused by the end points of the linear source results in an easy determination of the reions of penumbrae and umbrae on the face prior to shading calculation.This paper also discusses a method for displaying illuminance distribution on a shaded image aby using colored isolux contours."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14953","fieldValue":"ACM"}
