This package employs high-order adaptive methods in time and space within a method-of-lines approach and provides tolerance control of the spatial and temporal errors. The DAEs resulting from the spatial discretization (based on B-spline collocation) are handled by a substantially modified version of the Runge-Kutta solver, RADAU5. For each time step, the RADAU5 code computes an estimate of the temporal error and requires it to satisfy the user tolerance. After each time step BACOLR then computes a high-order estimate of the spatial error and requires this error estimate to satisfy the user tolerance. BACOLR was developed through a substantial modification of the adaptive method-of-lines package, BACOL. In this article we introduce the BACOLR package and present numerical results to show that the performance of BACOLR is comparable to and in some cases significantly superior to that of BACOL, which was shown in previous work to be more efficient, reliable and robust than other existing codes, especially for problems with solutions exhibiting narrow spikes or boundary layers."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19198","fieldValue":"Algorithm 874: BACOLRâ\u20AC\u201Dspatial and temporal error control software for PDEs based on high-order adaptive collocation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19198","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19198","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19199","fieldValue":" DSDP implements the dual-scaling algorithm for semidefinite programming. The source code for this interior-point algorithm, written entirely in ANSI C, is freely available under an open source license. The solver can be used as a subroutine library, as a function within the Matlab environment, or as an executable that reads and writes to data files. Initiated in 1997, DSDP has developed into an efficient and robust general-purpose solver for semidefinite programming. Its features include a convergence proof with polynomially bounded worst-case complexity, primal and dual feasible solutions when they exist, certificates of infeasibility when solutions do not exist, initial points that can be feasible or infeasible, relatively low memory requirements for an interior-point method, sparse and low-rank data structures, extensibility that allows applications to customize the solver and improve its performance, a subroutine library that enables it to be linked to larger applications, scalable performance for large problems on parallel architectures, and a well-documented interface and examples of its use. The package has been used in many applications and tested for efficiency, robustness, and ease of use."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19199","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19199","fieldValue":"ACM"}
