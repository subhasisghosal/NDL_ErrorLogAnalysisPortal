It is not, however, the technology itself that makes them smart but rather the way in which the technology is integrated, and their smartness surfaces through how people are able to interact with these objects. Hence, the key challenge for making smart objects successful is to design usable and useful interactions with them. We list five features that can contribute to the smartness of an object, and we discuss how smart objects can help resolve the simplicity-featurism paradox. We conclude by introducing the three articles in this special issue, which dive into various aspects of smart object interaction: augmenting objects with projection, service-oriented interaction with smart objects via a mobile portal, and an analysis of input-output relations in interaction with tangible smart objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7165","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7165","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1653","fieldValue":" Temperature has become an important constraint in high-performance processors, especially multicores. Thread migration will be essential to exploit the full potential of future thermally constrained multicores. We propose and study a thread migration method that maximizes performance under a temperature constraint, while minimizing the number of migrations and ensuring fairness between threads. We show that thread migration brings important performance gains and that it is most effective during the first tens of seconds following a decrease of the number of running threads."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1653","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1653","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7166","fieldValue":" Sensors, processors, and radios can be integrated invisibly into objects to make them smart and sensitive to user interaction, but feedback is often limited to beeps, blinks, or buzzes. We propose to redress this input-output imbalance by augmentation of smart objects with projected displays, thatâ\u20AC\u201Dunlike physical displaysâ\u20AC\u201Dallow seamless integration with the natural appearance of an object. In this article, we investigate how, in a ubiquitous computing world, smart objects can acquire and control a projection. We consider that projectors and cameras are ubiquitous in the environment, and we develop a novel conception and system that enables smart objects to spontaneously associate with projector-camera systems for cooperative augmentation. Projector-camera systems are conceived as generic, supporting standard computer vision methods for different appearance cues, and smart objects provide a model of their appearance for method selection at runtime, as well as sensor observations to constrain the visual detection process. Cooperative detection results in accurate location and pose of the object, which is then tracked for visual augmentation in response to display requests by the smart object. In this article, we define the conceptual framework underlying our approach; report on computer vision experiments that give original insight into natural appearance-based detection of everyday objects; show how object sensing can be used to increase speed and robustness of visual detection; describe and evaluate a fully implemented system; and describe two smart object applications to illustrate the system's cooperative augmentation process and the embodied interactions it enables with smart objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7166","fieldValue":"ACM"}
