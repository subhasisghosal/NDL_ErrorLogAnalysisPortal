Alexopoulos and Goldsman conducted a thorough examination of IR and BM; and Andrad√≥ttir and Argon proposed the method of replicated batch means (RBM), which combines good characteristics of IR and BM. This article gives analy-tical results for the mean and variance of the RBM estimator for a class of processes having initial transients with an additive form. Along the way, we provide succinct complementary extensions of some of the results in the aforementioned papers. Our expressions explicitly show how the transient function affects estimator performance and suggest that in some cases, the RBM estimator is a good compromise choice with respect to bias and variance. However, care must be taken to avoid an excessive number of replications when the transient function is pervasive. An example involving a simple moving average process illustrates our findings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24929","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24929","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24930","fieldValue":" Discrete event network simulators have emerged as popular tools for verification and performance evaluation of wireless networks. Nevertheless, the desire to model such networks at high fidelity implies high computational costs, limiting most researchers the ability to simulate networks with thousands of nodes. Previous attempts to optimize simulation of large-scale wireless networks have not appropriately modeled accumulation of weak interference, thereby suffering inaccuracies that may be further magnified in the evaluation of upper-layer protocols. This article presents a comprehensive analysis on the effects of common optimization techniques for large-scale wireless network simulation on the overall network performance. Based on the analysis, it formulates distance limit derivation and mobility update reduction that introduce bounded inaccuracy to the radio propagation simulation. It further proposes a novel technique, Lazy Event Scheduling with Corrective Retrospection, that reduces simulation events twenty-five fold without introducing any inaccuracy at all. The experimental results show that these optimizations can substantially improve the runtime performance of an already efficient wireless network simulator, by a factor of up to 55 for wireless networks with 3200 nodes without compromising the simulation's accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3411","fieldValue":" Past studies have established a crossmodal spatial attentional link among vision, audition, and touch. The present study examined the dependence of visual attention on the distance between a distal visual target (a changing element among static distractors) and the quadrant of the visual display cued by a proximal tactile stimulus. The distance between the center of the cued visual quadrant and the visual target was one of six values: 0, 90, 180, 350, 450, and 550 pixels. The distances of 0, 90, and 180 corresponded to the valid tactile cueing condition, where the tactile cue and the visual target occurred in the same quadrant. The distances of 350, 450, and 550 corresponded to the invalid tactile cueing condition, where the tactilely-cued quadrant did not match that of the visual change. Results from 10 young adults showed that mean response time increased with respect to the cue-target distance, thereby confirming a gradient of visual attention for proximal-distal tactile cueing. In addition, the response times for valid tactile cues were shorter than those for invalid tactile cues, confirming earlier findings that valid tactile cues facilitate visual search and invalid tactile cues interfere with visual search. The findings of the present study have implications for the design of multimodal attention-cueing systems for practical applications such as collision warning systems in automobiles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3411","fieldValue":"ACM"}
