{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13496","fieldValue":" Traditionally, test patterns that are generated for a given circuit are applied in an identical manner to all manufactured devices until each device under test either fails or passes each test. With increasing process variations, the statistical diversity of manufactured devices is increasing, making such one-size-fits-all approaches increasingly inefficient. Adaptive test techniques address this problem by tailoring the test decisions for the statistical characteristics of the device under test. In this article, we present several adaptive strategies to enable adaptive unknown bit masking for faster-than-at-speed testing so as to ensure no yield loss while attaining the maximum test quality based on tester memory constraints. We also develop a tester-enabled compression scheme that helps alleviate memory constraints further, shifting the tradeoff space favorably to improve test quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13497","fieldValue":" The increasing adoption of graphics processing units (GPUs) for high-performance computing raises the reliability challenge, which is generally ignored in traditional GPUs. GPUs usually support thousands of parallel threads and require a sizable register file. Such large register file is highly susceptible to soft errors and power-hungry. Although ECC has been adopted to register file in modern GPUs, it causes considerable power overhead, which further increases the power stress. Thus, an energy-efficient soft-error protection mechanism is more desirable. Besides its extremely low leakage power consumption, resistive memory (e.g., spin-transfer torque RAM) is also immune to the radiation induced soft errors due to its magnetic field based storage. In this article, we propose to LEverage reSistive memory to enhance the Soft-error robustness and reduce the power consumption (LESS) of registers in the General-Purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPUs). Since resistive memory experiences longer write latency compared to SRAM, we explore the unique characteristics of GPGPU applications to obtain the win-win gains: achieving the near-full soft-error protection for the register file, and meanwhile substantially reducing the energy consumption with negligible performance degradation. Our experimental results show that LESS is able to mitigate the registers soft-error vulnerability by 86&percnt; and achieve 61&percnt; energy savings with negligible (e.g., 1&percnt;) performance degradation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13497","fieldValue":"GPGPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13498","fieldValue":" Functional broadside tests avoid overtesting of delay faults by creating functional operation conditions during the clock cycles where delay faults are detected. When a circuit is embedded in a larger design, a functional broadside test needs to take into consideration the functional constraints that the design creates for its primary input vectors. At the same time, application of primary input vectors as part of a scan-based test requires hardware support. An earlier work considered the case where a primary input vector is held constant during a test. The approach described in this article matches the hardware for applying primary input vectors to the functional constraints that the design creates. This increases the transition fault coverage that can be achieved by functional broadside tests. This article also considers the effect on the transition fault coverage achievable using close-to-functional broadside tests."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13498","fieldValue":"ACM"}
