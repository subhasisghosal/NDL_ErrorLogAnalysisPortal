We describe a computational approach to stylizing and abstracting photographs that explicitly responds to this design goal. Our system transforms images into a line-drawing style using bold edges and large regions of constant color. To do this, it represents images as a hierarchical structure of parts and boundaries computed using state-of-the-art computer vision. Our system identifies the meaningful elements of this structure using a model of human perception and a record of a user's eye movements in looking at the photo; the system renders a new image using transformations that preserve and highlight these visual elements. Our method thus represents a new alternative for non-photorealistic rendering both in its visual style, in its approach to visual form, and in its techniques for interaction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15278","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15278","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15279","fieldValue":" We introduce Object-Based Image Editing (OBIE) for real-time animation and manipulation of static digital photographs. Individual image objects (such as an arm or nose, Figure 1) are selected, scaled, stretched, bent, warped or even deleted (with automatic hole filling) - at the object, rather than the pixel level - using simple gesture motions with a mouse. OBIE gives the user direct, local control over object shape, size, and placement while dramatically reducing the time required to perform image editing tasks.Object selection is performed by manually collecting (subobject) regions detected by a watershed algorithm. Objects are tessellated into a triangular mesh, allowing shape modification to be performed in real time using OpenGL's texture mapping hardware.Through the use of anchor points, the user is able to interactively perform editing operations on a whole object, or just part(s) of an object - including moving, scaling, rotating, stretching, bending, and deleting. Indirect manipulation of object shape is also provided through the use of sliders and Bezier curves. Holes created by movement are filled in real-time based on surrounding texture.When objects stretch or scale, we provide a method for preserving texture granularity or scale. We also present a texture brush, which allows the user to \"paint\" texture into different parts of an image, using existing image texture(s).OBIE allows the user to perform interactive, high-level editing of image objects in a few seconds to a few ten's of seconds"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15280","fieldValue":" Texturing using a set of two dimensional image maps is an established and widespread practice. However, it has many limitations. Parameterizing a model in texture space can be very difficult, particularly with representations such as implicit surfaces, subdivision surfaces, and very dense or detailed polygonal meshes. This paper proposes the use of a new kind of texture based on an octree, which needs no parameterization other than the surface itself, and yet has similar storage requirements to 2D maps. In addition, it offers adaptive detail, regular sampling over the surface, and continuity across surface boundaries. The paper addresses texture creation, painting, storage, processing, and rendering with octree textures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15280","fieldValue":"ACM"}
