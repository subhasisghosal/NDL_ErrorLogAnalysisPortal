First, an incrementally deployable version of the protocol may be needed. Second, a systematic study of the performance impact of incremental deployment is needed to evaluate potential deployment strategies. Choosing the wrong strategy can be disastrous, as it may inhibit reaping the benefits of an otherwise robust service and prevent widespread adoption.We focus on two router-assisted reliable multicast protocols, namely PGM and LMS. Our evaluation consists of three parts: 1) selection and classification of deployment strategies; 2) definition of performance metrics; and 3) systematic evaluation of deployment strategies. Our study yields several interesting results: 1) the performance of different deployment strategies varies widely, for example, with some strategies, both PGM and LMS approach full deployment performance with as little as 5% of the routers deployed; other strategies require up to 80% deployment to approach the same level; 2) our sensitivity analysis reveals relatively small variation in the results in most cases; and 3) the impact associated with partial deployment is different for each of these protocols; PGM tends to impact the network, whereas LMS the endpoints. Our study clearly demonstrates that the choice of a strategy has a substantial impact on performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9522","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9523","fieldValue":" We propose an address-light, integrated MAC and routing protocol (abbreviated AIMRP) for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Due to the broad spectrum of WSN applications, there is a need for protocol solutions optimized for specific application classes. AIMRP is proposed for WSNs deployed for detecting rare events which require prompt detection and response. AIMRP organizes the network into concentric tiers around the sink(s), and routes event reports by forwarding them from one tier to another, in the direction of (one of) the sink(s). AIMRP is address-light in that it does not employ unique per-node addressing, and integrated since the MAC control packets are also responsible for finding the next-hop node to relay the data, via an anycast query. For reducing the energy expenditure due to idle-listening, AIMRP provides a power-saving algorithm which requires absolutely no synchronization or information exchange. We evaluate AIMRP through analysis and simulations, and compare it with another MAC protocol proposed for WSNs, S-MAC. AIMRP outperforms S-MAC for event-detection applications, in terms of total average power consumption, while satisfying identical sensor-to-sink latency constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9523","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9523","fieldValue":"MAC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9523","fieldValue":"ACM"}
