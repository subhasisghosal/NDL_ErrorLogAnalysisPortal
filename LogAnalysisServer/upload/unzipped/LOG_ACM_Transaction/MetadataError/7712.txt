The received signal strength (RSS) measured by pairs of nodes can be used to obtain either range estimates or connectivity information. It is not clear, however: 1) when a range-based scheme should be used in favor of a connectivity-based one, and 2) how to optimally convert the RSS into connectivity data. This paper uses analysis of the Fisher information and the Cram√©r-Rao bound (CRB) to answer these questions. Solutions are found by comparing the network connectivity against two values: the critical connectivity (CC) and the optimal connectivity (OC). After discussing the properties of both values, we show how their approximation can be used to improve the performance of RF-based localization systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10236","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/10236","fieldValue":"Cram&#233;r-Rao bound (CRB)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10236","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10236","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1930","fieldValue":"Gonzalez-Mesa, M A"}
