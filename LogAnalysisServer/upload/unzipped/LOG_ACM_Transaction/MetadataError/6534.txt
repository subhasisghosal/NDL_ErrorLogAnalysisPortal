AEGIS software was uploaded to the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missionâ\u20AC™s Opportunity rover in December 2009 and has successfully demonstrated automated onboard targeting based on scientist-specified objectives. Prior to AEGIS, images were transmitted from the rover to the operations team on Earth; scientists manually analyzed the images, selected geological targets for the roverâ\u20AC™s remote-sensing instruments, and then generated a command sequence to execute the new measurements. AEGIS represents a significant paradigm shift---by using onboard data analysis techniques, the AEGIS software uses scientist input to select high-quality science targets with no human in the loop. This approach allows the rover to autonomously select and sequence targeted observations in an opportunistic fashion, which is particularly applicable for narrow field-of-view instruments (such as the MER Mini-TES spectrometer, the MER Panoramic camera, and the 2011 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) ChemCam spectrometer). This article provides an overview of the AEGIS automated targeting capability and describes how it is currently being used onboard the MER mission Opportunity rover."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7416","fieldValue":"Hayden, David S"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7416","fieldValue":"Thompson, David R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7416","fieldValue":" Current and proposed remote space missions, such as the proposed aerial exploration of Titan by an aerobot, often can collect more data than can be communicated back to Earth. Autonomous selective downlink algorithms can choose informative subsets of data to improve the science value of these bandwidth-limited transmissions. This requires statistical descriptors of the data that reflect very abstract and subtle distinctions in science content. We propose a metric learning strategy that teaches algorithms how best to cluster new data based on training examples supplied by domain scientists. We demonstrate that clustering informed by metric learning produces results that more closely match multiple scientistsâ\u20AC™ labelings of aerial data than do clusterings based on random or periodic sampling. A new metric-learning strategy accommodates training sets produced by multiple scientists with different and potentially inconsistent mission objectives. Our methods are fit for current spacecraft processors (e.g., RAD750) and would further benefit from more advanced spacecraft processor architectures, such as OPERA."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7416","fieldValue":"ACM"}
