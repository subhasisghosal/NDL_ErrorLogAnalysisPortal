Similarly, when packets incur low delays at upstream nodes, downstream nodes can reduce priority and schedule other packets first. The goal of this paper is to define a framework for design and analysis of coordinated multihop scheduling (CMS) which exploit such internode coordination. We first provide a general CMS definition which enables us to classify a number of schedulers from the literature, including G-EDF, FIFO+, CEDF, and work-conserving CJVC as examples of CMS schedulers. We then develop a distributed theory of traffic envelopes which enables us to derive end-to-end statistical admission control conditions for CMS schedulers. We show that CMS schedulers are able to limit traffic distortion to within a narrow range resulting in improved end-to-end performance and more efficient resource utilization. Consequently, our technique exploits statistical resource sharing among flows, classes, and nodes, and our results provide the first statistical multinode multiclass admission control algorithm for networks of work conserving servers."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9132","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9133","fieldValue":"Du, David H C"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9133","fieldValue":" Most of the QoS routing schemes proposed so far require periodic exchange of QoS state information among routers, imposing both communication overhead on the network and processing overhead on core routers. Furthermore, stale QoS state information causes the performance of these QoS routing schemes to degrade drastically. In order to circumvent these problems, we focus on localized QoS routing schemes where the edge routers make routing decisions using only local information and thus reducing the overhead at core routers. We first describe virtual capacity based routing (vcr), a theoretical scheme based on the notion of virtual capacity of a route. We then propose proportional sticky routing, an easily realizable approximation of vcr and analyze its performance. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that adaptive proportional routing is indeed a viable alternative to the global QoS routing approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9133","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
