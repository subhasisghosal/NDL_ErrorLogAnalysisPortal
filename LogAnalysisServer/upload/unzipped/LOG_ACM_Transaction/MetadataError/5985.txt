Previously, there was no simple way for designers to predict how the location, direction, velocity, precision, or amplitude of usersâ\u20AC™ movement affects performance and fatigue. We cluster muscle coactivation data from a 3D pointing task covering the whole reachable space of the arm. We identify 11 clusters of pointing movements with distinct muscular, spatio-temporal, and performance properties. We discuss their use as heuristics when designing for 3D pointing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5879","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5879","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5880","fieldValue":" Expressivity is a visceral capacity of the human body. To understand what makes a gesture expressive, we need to consider not only its spatial placement and orientation but also its dynamics and the mechanisms enacting them. We start by defining gesture and gesture expressivity, and then we present fundamental aspects of muscle activity and ways to capture information through electromyography and mechanomyography. We present pilot studies that inspect the ability of users to control spatial and temporal variations of 2D shapes and that use muscle sensing to assess expressive information in gesture execution beyond space and time. This leads us to the design of a study that explores the notion of gesture power in terms of control and sensing. Results give insights to interaction designers to go beyond simplistic gestural interaction, towards the design of interactions that draw on nuances of expressive gesture."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5880","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5880","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5881","fieldValue":"Hau Chua, Soon"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5881","fieldValue":" Binocular disparity allows interesting visual effects visible only to people with stereoscopic 3D displays. Here, we studied and applied one such effect, binocular luster, to the application of digital colorblind aids with active shutter 3D. We developed two prototype techniques, ColorBless and PatternBless, to investigate the effectiveness of such aids and to explore the potential applications of a luster effect in stereoscopic 3D beyond highlighting. User studies and interviews revealed that luster-based aids were fast and required lower cognitive effort than existing aids and were preferred over other aids by the majority of colorblind participants. We infer design implications of a luster effect from the study and propose potential applications in augmented visualization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5881","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5881","fieldValue":"ACM"}
