A penalized probabilistic First-Order Inductive Learning (pFOIL) algorithm is presented for error diagnosis of Chinese sentences. The pFOIL algorithm integrates inductive logic programming (ILP), First-Order Inductive Learning (FOIL), and a penalized log-likelihood function for error diagnosis. This algorithm considers the uncertain, imperfect, and conflicting characteristics of Chinese sentences to infer error types and produce human-interpretable rules for further error correction. In a pFOIL algorithm, relation pattern background knowledge and quantized t-score background knowledge are proposed to characterize a sentence and then used for likelihood estimation. The relation pattern background knowledge captures the morphological, syntactic and semantic relations among the words in a sentence. One or two kinds of the extracted relations are then integrated into a pattern to characterize a sentence. The quantized t-score values are used to characterize various relations of a sentence for quantized t-score background knowledge representation. Afterwards, a decomposition-based testing mechanism which decomposes a sentence into background knowledge set needed for each error type is proposed to infer all potential error types and causes of the sentence. With the pFOIL method, not only the error types but also the error causes and positions can be provided for CSL learners. Experimental results reveal that the pFOIL method outperforms the C4.5, maximum entropy, and Naive Bayes classifiers in error classification."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2999","fieldValue":"Error Diagnosis of Chinese Sentences Using Inductive Learning Algorithm and Decomposition-Based Testing Mechanism"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20931","fieldValue":"Wang, An-I Andy"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20931","fieldValue":" Modern file systems assume the use of disk, a system-wide performance bottleneck for over a decade. Current disk caching and RAM file systems either impose high overhead to access memory content or fail to provide mechanisms to achieve data persistence across reboots.The Conquest file system is based on the observation that memory is becoming inexpensive, which enables all file system services to be delivered from memory, except for providing large storage capacity. Unlike caching, Conquest uses memory with battery backup as persistent storage, and provides specialized and separate data paths to memory and disk. Therefore, the memory data path contains no disk-related complexity. The disk data path consists of optimizations only for the specialized disk usage pattern.Compared to a memory-based file system, Conquest incurs little performance overhead. Compared to several disk-based file systems, Conquest achieves 1.3x to 19x faster memory performance, and 1.4x to 2.0x faster performance when exercising both memory and disk.Conquest realizes most of the benefits of persistent RAM at a fraction of the cost of a RAM-only solution. It also demonstrates that disk-related optimizations impose high overheads for accessing memory content in a memory-rich environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20931","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20931","fieldValue":"ACM"}
