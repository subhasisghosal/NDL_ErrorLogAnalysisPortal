We present a TCP enhancement scheme, called rate-adaptive snoop (RA-Snoop). RA-Snoop caches TCP packets selectively based on the wireless channel condition and the cached packets are retransmitted locally over the wireless link in case corruption loss is detected. In addition, for effective adaptation to variable bandwidth, RA-Snoop calculates the window feedback based on the bandwidth-delay product estimation and the queue level, then conveys this feedback information on the receiver's advertised window field in the acknowledgements returning to TCP sources. We compare the performance of RA-Snoop with that of existing schemes in the aspect of goodput and fairness. Results from simulations reveal that RA-Snoop achieves significant improvements over the existing schemes for various traffic scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9447","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9447","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9447","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9447","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9448","fieldValue":" We study communication networks that employ drop-tail queueing and Additive-Increase Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) congestion control algorithms. It is shown that the theory of nonnegative matrices may be employed to model such networks. In particular, important network properties, such as: 1) fairness; 2) rate of convergence; and 3) throughput, can be characterized by certain nonnegative matrices. We demonstrate that these results can be used to develop tools for analyzing the behavior of AIMD communication networks. The accuracy of the models is demonstrated by several NS studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9448","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9448","fieldValue":"AIMD"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9448","fieldValue":"TCP"}
