Coalescing, however, can be harmful to the colorability of the graph because it tends to yield a graph with nodes of higher degrees. Unlike aggressive coalescing, which coalesces any pair of noninterfering copy-related nodes, conservative coalescing or iterated coalescing perform safe coalescing that preserves the colorability. Unfortunately, these heuristics give up coalescing too early, losing many opportunities for coalescing that would turn out to be safe. Moreover, they ignore the fact that coalescing may even improve the colorability of the graph by reducing the degree of neighbor nodes that are interfering with both the source and target nodes being coalesced. This article proposes a new heuristic called optimistic coalescing which optimistically performs aggressive coalescing, thus exploiting the positive impact of coalescing aggressively, but when a coalesced node is to be spilled, it is split back into separate nodes. Since there is a better chance of coloring one of those splits, we can reduce the overall spill amount."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20516","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20516","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2963","fieldValue":" Allomorphic variation, or form variation among morphs with the same meaning, is a stumbling block to morphological induction (MI). To address this problem, we present a hybrid approach that uses a small amount of linguistic knowledge in the form of orthographic rewrite rules to help refine an existing MI-produced segmentation. Using rules, we derive underlying analyses of morphs---generalized with respect to contextual spelling differences---from an existing surface morph segmentation, and from these we learn a morpheme-level segmentation. To learn morphemes, we have extended the Morfessor segmentation algorithm [Creutz and Lagus 2004; 2005; 2006] by using rules to infer possible underlying analyses from surface segmentations. A segmentation produced by Morfessor Categories-MAP Software v. 0.9.2 is used as input to our procedure and as a baseline that we evaluate against. To suggest analyses for our procedure, a set of language-specific orthographic rules is needed. Our procedure has yielded promising improvements for English and Turkish over the baseline approach when tested on the Morpho Challenge 2005 and 2007 style evaluations. On the Morpho Challenge 2007 test evaluation, we report gains over the current best unsupervised contestant for Turkish, where our technique shows a 2.5&percnt; absolute F-score improvement."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2963","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2963","fieldValue":"ACM"}
