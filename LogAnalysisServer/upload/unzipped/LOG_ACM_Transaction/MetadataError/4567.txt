The package, named AKAROA, accepts ordinary (nonparallel) simulation programs, and alll further stages of stochastic simulation should be transparent for users. The package employs a new method of sequential estimation for the Multiple-Replications-in-Parallel scenario. All basic functions, including the transformation of originally nonparallel simulators into ones suitable for parallel execution, control of the precision of estimates, and stopping of parallel simulation processes when the required precision of the overall steady-state estimates is achieved, are automated. The package can be used on multiprocessor systems and\/or heterogeneous computer networks, involving an arbitrary number of processors. The design issues, architecture, and implementation of AKAROA, as well as the results of its preliminary performance studies are presented"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24809","fieldValue":" An acceptance-rejection algorithm for the simulation of random variables in statistical exponential families is described. This algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the family, except sufficient stati stics and the value of the parameter. It allows simulation from many members of the exponential family. We present some bounds on computing time, as well as the main properties of the empirical measures of samples simulated by our methods (functional Glivenko-Cantelli and central limit theorems). This algorithm is applied in order to evaluate the distribution of M-estimators under composite alternatives; we also propose its use in Bayesian statistics in order to simulate from posterior distributions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3398","fieldValue":"OSullivan, Carol"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3398","fieldValue":" In this article, we evaluate the effects of position, orientation, and camera viewpoint on the plausibility of pedestrian formations. In a set of three perceptual studies, we investigated how humans perceive characteristics of virtual crowds in static scenes reconstructed from annotated still images, where the orientations and positions of the individuals have been modified. We found that by applying rules based on the contextual information of the scene, we improved the perceived realism of the crowd formations when compared to random formations. We also examined the effect of camera viewpoint on the plausibility of virtual pedestrian scenes, and we found that an eye-level viewpoint is more effective for disguising random behaviors, while a canonical viewpoint results in these behaviors being perceived as less realistic than an isometric or top-down viewpoint. Results from these studies can help in the creation of virtual crowds, such as computer graphics pedestrian models or architectural scenes, and identify situations when users' perception is less accurate."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3398","fieldValue":"ACM"}
