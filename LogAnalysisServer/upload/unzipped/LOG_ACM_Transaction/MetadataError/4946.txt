In this architecture, each client maintains a local copy of the virtual environment (VE). A centralized physics simulation running on a server calculates the object states based on haptic device position information received from the clients. The object states are sent back to the clients to update the local copies of the VE, which are used to render interaction forces displayed to the user through a haptic device. Communication delay leads to delayed object state updates and increased force feedback rendered at the clients. In this article, we analyze the effect of communication delay on the magnitude of the rendered forces at the clients for cooperative multi-user interactions with rigid objects. The analysis reveals guidelines on the tolerable communication delay. If this delay is exceeded, the increased force magnitude becomes haptically perceivable. We propose an adaptive force rendering scheme to compensate for this effect, which dynamically changes the stiffness used in the force rendering at the clients. Our experimental results, including a subjective user study, verify the applicability of the analysis and the proposed scheme to compensate the effect of time-varying communication delay in a multi-user SHVE."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3517","fieldValue":"Compensating the Effect of Communication Delay in Client-Server--Based Shared Haptic Virtual Environments"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3517","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3517","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3518","fieldValue":" Previous research shows that human eye movements can serve as a valuable source of information about the structural elements of the oculomotor system and they also can open a window to the neural functions and cognitive mechanisms related to visual attention and perception. The research field of eye movement-driven biometrics explores the extraction of individual-specific characteristics from eye movements and their employment for recognition purposes. In this work, we present a study for the incorporation of dynamic saccadic features into a model of eye movement-driven biometrics. We show that when these features are added to our previous biometric framework and tested on a large database of 322 subjects, the biometric accuracy presents a relative improvement in the range of 31.6--33.5&percnt; for the verification scenario, and in range of 22.3--53.1&percnt; for the identification scenario. More importantly, this improvement is demonstrated for different types of visual stimulus (random dot, text, video), indicating the enhanced robustness offered by the incorporation of saccadic vigor and acceleration cues."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3519","fieldValue":" Modern computer graphics are capable of generating highly photorealistic images. Although this can be considered a success for the computer graphics community, it has given rise to complex forensic and legal issues. A compelling example comes from the need to distinguish between computer-generated and photographic images as it pertains to the legality and prosecution of child pornography in the United States. We performed psychophysical experiments to determine the accuracy with which observers are capable of distinguishing computer-generated from photographic images. We find that observers have considerable difficulty performing this taskâ\u20AC\u201Dmore difficulty than we observed 5 years ago when computer-generated imagery was not as photorealistic. We also find that observers are more likely to report that an image is photographic rather than computer generated, and that resolution has surprisingly little effect on performance. Finally, we find that a small amount of training greatly improves accuracy."}
