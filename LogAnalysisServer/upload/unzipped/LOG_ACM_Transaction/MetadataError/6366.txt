{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1634","fieldValue":" As processor performance continues to improve at a rate much higher than DRAM and network performance, we are approaching a time when large-scale distributed shared memory systems will have remote memory latencies measured in tens of thousands of processor cycles. The Impulse memory system architecture adds an optional level of address indirection at the memory controller. Applications can use this level of indirection to control how data is accessed and cached and thereby improve cache and bus utilization and reduce the number of memory accesses required. Previous Impulse work focuses on uniprocessor systems and relies on software to flush processor caches when necessary to ensure data coherence. In this paper, we investigate an extension of Impulse to multiprocessor systems that extends the coherence protocol to maintain data coherence without requiring software-directed cache flushing. Specifically, the multiprocessor Impulse controller can gather\/scatter data across the network while its coherence protocol guarantees that each gather request gets coherent data and each scatter request updates every coherent replica in the system. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system can significantly outperform conventional systems, achieving an average speedup of 9X on four memory-bound benchmarks on a 32-processor system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1634","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1634","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6927","fieldValue":" Today and future many-core systems are facing the utilization wall and dark silicon problems, for which not all the processing engines can be powered at the same time as this will lead to a power consumption higher than the Total Design Power (TDP) budget. Recently, computational sprinting approaches addressed the problem by exploiting the intrinsic thermal capacitance of the chip and the properties of common applications, which require intense, but temporary, use of resources. The thermal capacitance, possibly augmented with phase change materials, enables the temporary activation of all the resources simultaneously, although they largely exceed the steady-state thermal design power. In this article, we present an innovative and low-overhead hierarchical model-predictive controller for managing thermally safe sprinting with predictable resprinting rate, which ensures the correct execution of mixed-criticality tasks. Well-targeted simulations, also based on real workload benchmarks, show the applicability and the effectiveness of our solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6928","fieldValue":"Lazarescu, Mihai T"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6928","fieldValue":" Networked embedded systems are essential building blocks of a broad variety of distributed applications ranging from agriculture to industrial automation to healthcare and more. These often require specific energy optimizations to increase the battery lifetime or to operate using energy harvested from the environment. Since a dominant portion of power consumption is determined and managed by software, the software development process must have access to the sophisticated power management mechanisms provided by state-of-the-art hardware platforms to achieve the best tradeoff between system availability and reactivity. Furthermore, internode communications must be considered to properly assess the energy consumption. This article describes a design flow based on a SystemC virtual platform including both accurate power models of the hardware components and a fast abstract model of the wireless network. The platform allows both model-driven design of the application and the exploration of power and network management alternatives. These can be evaluated in different network scenarios, allowing one to exploit power optimization strategies without requiring expensive field trials. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated via experiments on a wireless body area network application."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6928","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6928","fieldValue":"ACM"}
