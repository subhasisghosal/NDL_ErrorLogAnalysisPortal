Image-based Rendering (IBR) can provide the realistic imagery required at real-time speed. For indoor scenes however, two challenges are especially prominent. First, the reconstructed 3D geometry must be compact, but faithful enough to respect occlusion relationships when viewed up close. Second, man-made materials call for view-dependent texturing, but using too many input photographs reduces performance. We customize a typical RGB-D 3D surface reconstruction pipeline to produce a coarse global 3D surface, and local, per-view geometry for each input image. Our tiled IBR preserves quality by economizing on the expected contributions that entire groups of input pixels make to a final image. The two components are designed to work together, giving real-time performance, while hardly sacrificing quality. Testing on a variety of challenging scenes shows that our inside-out IBR scales favorably with the number of input images."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17728","fieldValue":"RGB-D"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17728","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17728","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17729","fieldValue":"Wang, Peng-Shuai"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17729","fieldValue":" We present a data-driven approach for mesh denoising. Our key idea is to formulate the denoising process with cascaded non-linear regression functions and learn them from a set of noisy meshes and their ground-truth counterparts. Each regression function infers the normal of a denoised output mesh facet from geometry features extracted from its neighborhood facets on the input mesh and sends the result as the input of the next regression function. Specifically, we develop a filtered facet normal descriptor (FND) for modeling the geometry features around each facet on the noisy mesh and model a regression function with neural networks for mapping the FNDs to the facet normals of the denoised mesh. To handle meshes with different geometry features and reduce the training difficulty, we cluster the input mesh facets according to their FNDs and train neural networks for each cluster separately in an offline learning stage. At runtime, our method applies the learned cascaded regression functions to a noisy input mesh and reconstructs the denoised mesh from the output facet normals. Our method learns the non-linear denoising process from the training data and makes no specific assumptions about the noise distribution and geometry features in the input. The runtime denoising process is fully automatic for different input meshes. Our method can be easily adapted to meshes with arbitrary noise patterns by training a dedicated regression scheme with mesh data and the particular noise pattern. We evaluate our method on meshes with both synthetic and real scanned noise, and compare it to other mesh denoising algorithms. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art mesh denoising methods and successfully removes different kinds of noise for meshes with various geometry features."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17729","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17729","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2676","fieldValue":" We study the k-route cut problem: given an undirected edge-weighted graph G &equals; (V, E), a collection ${(s_1, t1), (s2, t2), â\u20AC¦, (sr, tr)} of source-sink pairs, and an integer connectivity requirement k, the goal is to find a minimum-weight subset Eâ\u20AC² of edges to remove, such that the connectivity of every pair (si, ti) falls below k. Specifically, in the edge-connectivity version, EC-kRC, the requirement is that there are at most (k âˆ\u2019 1) edge-disjoint paths connecting si to ti$ in G&setmn;Eâ\u20AC², while in the vertex-connectivity version, VC-kRC, the same requirement is for vertex-disjoint paths. Prior to our work, poly-logarithmic approximation algorithms have been known for the special case where k &les; 3, but no non-trivial approximation algorithms were known for any value k > 3, except in the single-source setting. We show an O(klog$ ^3\/2r)-approximation algorithm for EC-kRC with uniform edge weights, and several polylogarithmic bi-criteria approximation algorithms for EC-kRC and VC-kRC, where the connectivity requirement k is violated by a constant factor. We complement these upper bounds by proving that VC-kRC is hard to approximate to within a factor of k&epsi;$ for some fixed &epsi; > 0. We then turn to study a simpler version of VC-kRC, where only one source-sink pair is present. We give a simple bi-criteria approximation algorithm for this case, and show evidence that even this restricted version of the problem may be hard to approximate. For example, we prove that the single source-sink pair version of VC-kRC has no constant-factor approximation, assuming Feigeâ\u20AC™s Random Îº-AND assumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2676","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-route cut problem"}
