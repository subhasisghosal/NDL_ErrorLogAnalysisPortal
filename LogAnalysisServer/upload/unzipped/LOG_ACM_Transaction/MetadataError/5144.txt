The proposed LSTM-RNN model sequentially takes each word in a sentence, extracts its information, and embeds it into a semantic vector. Due to its ability to capture long term memory, the LSTM-RNN accumulates increasingly richer information as it goes through the sentence, and when it reaches the last word, the hidden layer of the network provides a semantic representation of the whole sentence. In this paper, the LSTM-RNN is trained in a weakly supervised manner on user click-through data logged by a commercial web search engine. Visualization and analysis are performed to understand how the embedding process works. The model is found to automatically attenuate the unimportant words and detect the salient keywords in the sentence. Furthermore, these detected keywords are found to automatically activate different cells of the LSTM-RNN, where words belonging to a similar topic activate the same cell. As a semantic representation of the sentence, the embedding vector can be used in many different applications. These automatic keyword detection and topic allocation abilities enabled by the LSTM-RNN allow the network to perform document retrieval, a difficult language processing task, where the similarity between the query and documents can be measured by the distance between their corresponding sentence embedding vectors computed by the LSTM-RNN. On a web search task, the LSTM-RNN embedding is shown to significantly outperform several existing state of the art methods. We emphasize that the proposed model generates sentence embedding vectors that are specially useful for web document retrieval tasks. A comparison with a well known general sentence embedding method, the Paragraph Vector, is performed. The results show that the proposed method in this paper significantly outperforms Paragraph Vector method for web document retrieval task."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4015","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4015","fieldValue":"Deep sentence embedding using long short-term memory networks: analysis and application to information retrieval"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4016","fieldValue":" Microphone arrays are widely used in speech enhancement systems for noisy and reverberant environments. Recently, a generalized spherical array beamforming approach was developed incorporating binaural sound reproduction in the beamforming process. This generalized spherical array beam-former (GSB) maintains the spatial information through the bin-aural cues and improves both the spatial realism and the speech intelligibility. In this paper, the theory of the tradeoff that arises when incorporating both beamforming and binaural reproduction in a single array is developed and investigated through a simulation study and a listening test. By representing the GSB formulation in matrix form for investigating the single plane-wave scenario, two measures are developed in order to evaluate the performance of the GSB in terms of both binaural reproduction and spatial selectivity. These measures are then employed in the evaluation of the performance of various GSB beam-patterns using simulations. A listening test experiment that validates the simulation results is then reported. Results validate the theory, i.e., the GSB can be used to integrate successfully binaural reproduction and beamforming, allowing the user to emphasize either of the two, but with a clear tradeoff; improving one is only possible at the expense of degrading the other."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4016","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4016","fieldValue":"Theory and perceptual evaluation of the binaural reproduction and beamforming tradeoff in the generalized spherical array beamformer"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4016","fieldValue":"ACM"}
