Previous research in information visualization has shown that visualization techniques can help users comprehend information and accomplish information tasks more efficiently and effectively. However, only a limited number of such techniques have been applied to Web search result visualization with mixed evaluation results. Using a design science approach, this research designed and implemented a glyph (a graphical object that represents the values of multiple dimensions using multiple visual parameters) and a system for visualizing Web search results. A flower metaphor was adopted in the glyph design to represent the characteristics and metadata of Web documents. Following the cognitive fit theory, an experimental study was conducted to evaluate three displays: a numeric display, a glyph display, and a combined display which showed numbers only, glyphs only, and both, respectively. Experimental results showed that the glyph display and the combined display performed better when task complexity was high, and the numeric display and the combined display performed better when task complexity was low. The combined display also received the best perceived usability from the subjects. Based on the findings, the implications of the study to research and practice are discussed and some future research directions are suggested."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8137","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8137","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8137","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8138","fieldValue":"Kuo, Feng-Yang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8138","fieldValue":"Yin, Chun-Po"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8138","fieldValue":" Talks are actions, and language represents the medium through which we encounter reality, carry out practical reasoning, and construct social actions. This study applies the speech act theory to analyze the data collected in a study by Trauth and Jessup [2000] and confirms previous research findings that both the topic and the group size influence the pattern of discussion, especially when issues are threatening. It also shows that the abundance of speech acts like assertives, directives, and expressives can be accounted for by a few simple recurring patterns, indicating participants are rather close-minded. More important, linguistic analysis helps uncovering defensive speech routines that inhibit the generation of valid information and create self-sealing patterns of escalating error. Linguistic analysis may therefore complement positivist and interpretive analysis by examining if participants' engagement is superficial or profound, if consensus is reached or blocked, and if certain speech acts lead to dysfunctional organizational learning. Hence, in the era of participatory Web in which language is the primary medium for interactive sharing and dynamic collaboration, linguistic analysis can be applied to study the promises and declarations that people rely on to initiate, coordinate, and complete social actions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8138","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8138","fieldValue":"A linguistic analysis of group support systems interactions for uncovering social realities of organizations"}
