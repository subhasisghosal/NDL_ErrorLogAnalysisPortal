{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10102","fieldValue":" A large number of network applications today allow several users to interact together using the many-to-many service mode. In many-to-many communication, also referred to as group communication, a session consists of a group of users (we refer to them as members), where each member transmits its traffic to all other members in the same group. In this paper, we address the problem of designing and provisioning of WDM networks to support many-to-many traffic grooming. Our objective is to minimize the overall network cost, which is dominated by the cost of higher layer electronic ports (i.e., transceivers) and the number of wavelengths used. Based on different WDM node architectures, we propose four different WDM networks for many-to-many traffic grooming. For each network, we analyze the many-to-many traffic grooming problem and provide an optimal as well as a heuristic solution. A comprehensive comparison between the four networks reveals that each of the networks is the most cost-effective choice for a certain range of traffic granularities."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10102","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10102","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10102","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1918","fieldValue":"Potop-Butucaru, Dumitru"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1918","fieldValue":" We propose a software pipelining technique adapted to specific hard real-time scheduling problems. Our technique optimizes both computation throughput and execution cycle makespan, with makespan being prioritary. It also takes advantage of the predicated execution mechanisms of our embedded execution platform. To do so, it uses a reservation table formalism allowing the manipulation of the execution conditions of operations. Our reservation tables allow the double reservation of a resource at the same dates by two different operations, if the operations have exclusive execution conditions. Our analyses can determine when double reservation is possible even for operations belonging to different iterations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10103","fieldValue":" Protection techniques for optical networks mainly rely on preallocated backup bandwidth, which may not be able to provide full protection guarantee when multiple failures occur in a network. To protect against multiple concurrent potential failures and to utilize the available resources more efficiently, strategies such as backup reprovisioning (BR) rearrange backups of protected connections after one failure occurs or, more generally, whenever the network state changes, e.g., when a new request arrives or terminates. Recently, new solutions for automatized management in optical networks promise to allow customers to specify on-demand the terms of the service level agreement (SLA) to be guaranteed by the service provider. In this paper, we study different backup reprovisioning techniques able to further reduce the capacity requirements exploiting the knowledge, among the other service level specifications (SLSs), of the connection holding time."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10103","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
