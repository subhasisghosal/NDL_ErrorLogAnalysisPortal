We propose to solve this problem by obtaining a performance vector, with its elements representing the performances of subtasks, for a given input combination of sensors and their placement. Then we show that the optimal sensor selection problem can be converted into the form of Integer Linear Programming problem (ILP) by using a linear model for computing the optimal performance vector corresponding to a sensor combination. Optimal performance vector corresponding to a sensor combination refers to the performance vector corresponding to the optimal placement of a sensor combination. To demonstrate the utility of our technique, we design and build a surveillance system consisting of PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) cameras and active motion sensors for capturing faces. Finally, we show experimentally that optimal placement of sensors based on the design maximizes the system performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25346","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25346","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25347","fieldValue":" In this article, we study how a sensor-rich world can be exploited by digital recording devices such as cameras and camcorders to improve a user's ability to search through a large repository of image and video files. We design and implement a digital recording system that records identities and locations of objects (as advertised by their sensors) along with visual images (as recorded by a camera). The process, which we refer to as Sensor-Enhanced Video Annotation (SEVA), combines a series of correlation, interpolation, and extrapolation techniques. It produces a tagged stream that later can be used to efficiently search for videos or frames containing particular objects or people. We present detailed experiments with a prototype of our system using both stationary and mobile objects as well as GPS and ultrasound. Our experiments show that: (i) SEVA has zero error rates for static objects, except very close to the boundary of the viewable area; (ii) for moving objects or a moving camera, SEVA only misses objects leaving or entering the viewable area by 1--2 frames; (iii) SEVA can scale to 10 fast-moving objects using current sensor technology; and (iv) SEVA runs online using relatively inexpensive hardware."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25348","fieldValue":" Motivated by the wide use of TCP for multimedia streaming in practice and the increasing availability of multipath between end hosts, we study multipath live streaming via TCP in this article. We first design a simple and practical TCP-based multipath streaming scheme, named Dynamic MPath-streaming (DMP-streaming), which dynamically distributes packets over multiple paths by implicitly inferring the available bandwidths on these paths. To allow systematic performance study, we develop an analytical model for DMP-streaming and validate the model using extensive ns simulation and Internet experiments. We explore the parameter space of this model and find that DMP-streaming generally provides satisfactory performance when the aggregate achievable TCP throughput is 1.6 times the video bitrate, when allowing a few seconds of startup delay. Last, we comment on the benefits of using multipath versus single path for TCP-based streaming."}
