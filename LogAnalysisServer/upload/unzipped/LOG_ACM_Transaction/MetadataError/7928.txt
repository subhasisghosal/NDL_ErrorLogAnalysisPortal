Yet, existing Wi-Fi tethering schemes consume excessive power: They keep the Wi-Fi interface in a high power state regardless if there is ongoing traffic or not. In this paper, we propose DozyAP to improve the power efficiency of Wi-Fi tethering. Based on measurements in typical applications, we identify many opportunities that a tethering phone could sleep to save power. We design a simple yet reliable sleep protocol to coordinate the sleep schedule of the tethering phone with its clients without requiring tight time synchronization. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage, sleep interval adaptation algorithm to automatically adapt the sleep intervals to ongoing traffic patterns of various applications. DozyAP does not require any changes to the 802.11 protocol and is incrementally deployable through software updates. We have implemented DozyAP on commercial smartphones. Experimental results show that, while retaining comparable user experiences, our implementation can allow the Wi-Fi interface to sleep for up to 88% of the total time in several different applications and reduce the system power consumption by up to 33% under the restricted programmability of current Wi-Fi hardware."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10671","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10672","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of supporting traffic with elastic bandwidth requirements and average end-to-end delay constraints in multihop wireless networks, with focus on source rates and link data rates as the key resource allocation decisions. The network utility maximization-based approaches to support delay-sensitive traffic have been predominantly based on either reducing link utilization, or approximation of links as M\/D\/1 queues, which lead to inefficient link utilization under optimal resource allocation, and mostly to unpredictable transient behavior of packet delays. On the contrary, we present an alternative formulation where the delay constraint is omitted and sources' utility functions are multiplied by a weight factor. The alternative optimization problem is solved by a scheduling algorithm incorporating a duality-based rate control algorithm at its inner layer, where link prices correlate with their average queueing delays. We then present an alternative strategy where the utility weight of each source is adjusted to ensure its desired optimal path prices, and hence the desired average path delays. Since the proposed strategy is based on solving a concave optimization problem for the elastic traffic, it leads to maximal utilization of the network capacity. The proposed approach is then realized by a scheduling algorithm that runs jointly with an integral controller whereby each source independently regulates the queueing delay on its paths at the desired level, using its utility weight factor as the control variable. The proposed algorithms are shown, using theoretical analysis and simulation, to achieve asymptotic regulation of end-to-end delay with good performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10672","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10672","fieldValue":"Joint rate control and scheduling for providing bounded delay with high efficiency in multihop wireless networks"}
