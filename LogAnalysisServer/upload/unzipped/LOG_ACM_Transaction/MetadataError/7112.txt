{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9050","fieldValue":" We propose a new media-access and connection-establishment protocol for an ad-hoc quasi-synchronous packet radio network (QSPNET). In the QSPNET, the bandwidth is partitioned into a data channel, used to transmit packets, and a control channel, used to make reservations. Transmitted wave-forms in the QSPNET are made quasi-synchronous by using a local GPS clock. The QSPNET uses a novel linear decorrelator receiver for multiuser detection, which permits the reception of quasi-synchronous code division multiple access (QS-CDMA) waveforms. We initially describe the QSPNET and its connection and flow control protocols, giving the rules of transmission and reception followed by all mobiles. We also provide performance results for the case where connection requests are generated at each node of the QSPNET according to a random process over an infinite time horizon. In particular, we obtain results on the achievable throughput and the average delay as a function of the transmission radius, the quasi-synchronous uncertainty interval, the duration of the connections, and the buffer size per node."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9050","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/9050","fieldValue":"<i>Ad hoc<\/i> packet radio networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9050","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9050","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9051","fieldValue":" The delay-boundary prediction algorithms currently implemented by transport protocols are lowpass filters based on autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) models. However, recent studies have revealed a fractal-like structure of delay sequences, which may not be well suited to ARMA models. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-boundary prediction algorithm based on a deviation-lag function (DLF) to characterize end-to-end delay variations. Compared to conventional algorithms derived from ARMA models, the new algorithm can adapt to delay variations more rapidly and share delay's robust high-order statistical information (jitter deviation) among competing connections along a common network path. Preliminary experiments show that it outperforms Jacobson's algorithm, which is based on an ARMA model, by significantly reducing the prediction error rate. To show the practical feasibility of the DLF algorithm, we also propose a skeleton implementation model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9051","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9051","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9051","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9052","fieldValue":"Tsang, Danny H K"}
