This view takes on new relevance given the emergence of conversational social video as a popular genre among viewers looking for entertainment and among video contributors as a channel for debate, expertise sharing, and artistic expression. From the perspective of human behavior understanding, in conversational social video both verbal and nonverbal information is conveyed by speakers and decoded by viewers. We present a systematic study of classification and ranking of mood impressions in social video, using vlogs from YouTube. Our approach considers eleven natural mood categories labeled through crowdsourcing by external observers on a diverse set of conversational vlogs. We extract a comprehensive number of nonverbal and verbal behavioral cues from the audio and video channels to characterize the mood of vloggers. Then we implement and validate vlog classification and vlog ranking tasks using supervised learning methods. Following a reliability and correlation analysis of the mood impression data, our study demonstrates that, while the problem is challenging, several mood categories can be inferred with promising performance. Furthermore, multimodal features perform consistently better than single-channel features. Finally, we show that addressing mood as a ranking problem is a promising practical direction for several of the mood categories studied."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7218","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7218","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7219","fieldValue":" Smart environments are now designed as natural interfaces to capture and understand human behavior without a need for explicit human-computer interaction. In this article, we present a general-purpose architecture that acquires and understands human behaviors through a sensing floor. The pressure field generated by moving people is captured and analyzed. Specific actions and events are then detected by a low-level processing engine and sent to high-level interfaces providing different functions. The proposed architecture and sensors are modular, general-purpose, cheap, and suitable for both small- and large-area coverage. Some sample entertainment and virtual reality applications that we developed to test the platform are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7219","fieldValue":"ACM"}
