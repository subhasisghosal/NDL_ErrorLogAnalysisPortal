{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1954","fieldValue":" Modern superscalar CPUs contain large complex structures and diverse execution units, consuming wide dynamic power range. Building a power delivery network for the worst-case power consumption is not energy efficient and often is impossible to fit in small systems. Instantaneous power excursions can cause voltage droops. Power management algorithms are too slow to respond to instantaneous events. In this article, we propose a novel compiler-directed framework to address this problem. The framework is validated on a 4th Generation IntelÂ® Coreâ\u201E¢ processor and with simulator on output trace. Up to 16&percnt; performance speedup is measured over baseline for the SPEC CPâ\u20AC\u2020 benchmarks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1954","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1954","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10477","fieldValue":" Rate control methodologies that are currently available in IEEE 802.11 network cards seriously underutilize network resources and, in addition, per-second throughputs suffer from high variability. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm, H-RCA, that overcomes these shortcomings, giving substantially higher, and less variable, throughput. The approach solely uses information already available at the driver-level to function and can be implemented on 802.11e commodity hardware. H-RCA's design objective is to minimize the average time each packet spends on the medium (including retries) in order to maximize total network throughput. It uses a development of a recently proposed estimation scheme to distinguish transmission failures due to collisions from those caused by channel noise. It employs an estimate of the packet loss ratio due to noise in assessing whether it is appropriate to change rate. We demonstrate experimentally that packet loss ratio is not necessarily a monotonic increasing function of rate; this is accounted for in H-RCA's design. A s H-RCA statistically separates noise losses from those caused by collisions, ns-2 simulations show that it is robust to changing environments. H-RCA does not require specific hardware support nor any change to the IEEE 802.11 protocol. This point is substantiated with results from an experimental implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10477","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10477","fieldValue":"TXOP"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10477","fieldValue":"WLAN"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10478","fieldValue":" All practical wireless communication systems are prone to errors. At the symbol level, such wireless errors have a well-defined structure: When a receiver decodes a symbol erroneously, it is more likely that the decoded symbol is a good \"approximation\" of the transmitted symbol than a randomly chosen symbol among all possible transmitted symbols. Based on this property, we define approximate communication, a method that exploits this error structure to natively provide unequal error protection to data bits. Unlike traditional [forward error correction (FEC)-based] mechanisms of unequal error protection that consume additional network and spectrum resources to encode redundant data, the approximate communication technique achieves this property at the PHY layer without consuming any additional network or spectrum resources (apart from a minimal signaling overhead). Approximate communication is particularly useful to media delivery applications that can benefit significantly from unequal error protection of data bits. We show the usefulness of this method to such applications by designing and implementing an end-to-end media delivery system, called Apex. Our Software Defined Radio (SDR)-based experiments reveal that Apex can improve video quality by 5-20 dB [peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)] across a diverse set of wireless conditions when compared to traditional approaches. We believe that mechanisms such as Apex can be a cornerstone in designing future wireless media delivery systems under any error-prone channel condition."}
