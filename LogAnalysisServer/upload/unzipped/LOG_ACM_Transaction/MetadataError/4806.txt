In this article, we propose to address this problem by integrating query-related contextual information into an advanced query model to improve the performance of QBE-based web image retrieval. We consider both the local and global context of the query image. The local context can be inferred from the web pages and the click-through log associated with the query image, while the global context is derived from the entire corpus comprising all web images and the associated web pages. To effectively incorporate the local query context we propose a language modeling based approach to deal with the combined structured query representation from the contextual and visual information. The global query context is integrated by the multi-modal relevance model to â\u20ACœreconstructâ\u20AC? the query from the document models indexed in the corpus. In this way, the global query context is employed to address the noise or missing information in the query and its local context, so that a comprehensive and robust query model can be obtained. We evaluated the proposed approach on a representative product image dataset collected from the web and demonstrated that the inclusion of the local and global query contexts significantly improves the performance of QBE-based web image retrieval."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25455","fieldValue":" The EDCA mechanism of the IEEE 802.11 standard has been designed to support, among others, video traffic. This mechanism relies on a number of parameters whose configuration is left open by the standard. Although there are some recommended values for these parameters, they are fixed independent of the WLAN conditions, which results in suboptimal performance. Following this observation, a number of approaches in the literature have been devised to set the EDCA parameters based on an estimation of the WLAN conditions. However, these previous approaches are based on heuristics and hence do not guarantee optimized performance. In this article we propose a novel algorithm to adjust the EDCA parameters to carry video traffic which, in contrast to previous approaches, is sustained on mathematical foundations that guarantee optimal performance. In particular, our approach builds upon (i) an analytical model of the WLAN performance under video traffic, used to derive the optimal point of operation of EDCA, and (ii) a control theoretic designed mechanism which drives the WLAN to this point of operation. Via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed approach performs optimally and substantially outperforms the standard recommended configuration as well as previous adaptive proposals."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25455","fieldValue":"EDCA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25455","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25455","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25456","fieldValue":" This article presents a novel joint layered approach to simultaneously achieve both reliable and secure mobile JPEG-2000 image streaming. With a priori knowledge of JPEG-2000 source coding and channel coding, the proposed joint system integrates authentication into the media error protection components to ensure that every source-decodable media unit is authenticated. By such a dedicated design, the proposed scheme protects both compressed JPEG-2000 codestream and the authentication data from wireless channel impairments. It is fundamentally different from many existing systems that consider the problem of media authentication separately from the other operations in the media transmission system. By utilizing the contextual relationship, such as coding dependency and content importance between media slices for authentication hash appending, the proposed scheme generates an extremely low authentication overhead. Under this joint layered coding framework, an optimal rate allocation algorithm for source coding, channel coding, and media authentication is developed to guarantee end-to-end media quality. Experiment results on JPEG-2000 images validate the proposed scheme and demonstrate that the performance of the proposed scheme is approaching its upper bound, in which case no authentication is applied to the media stream."}
