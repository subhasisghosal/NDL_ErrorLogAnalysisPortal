It has been recently shown that in high-level eukaryotes enhancers rarely work alone, instead they collaborate by forming clusters of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). Even if the binding of transcription factors is sequence-specific, the identification of functionally similar enhancers is very difficult. A similarity measure to detect related regulatory sequences is crucial to understand functional correlation between two enhancers. This will allow large-scale analyses, clustering and genome-wide classifications. In this paper we present Under2, a parameter-free alignment-free statistic based on variable-length words. As opposed to traditional alignment-free methods, which are based on fixed-length patterns or, in other words, tied to a fixed resolution, our statistic is built upon variable-length words, and thus multiple resolutions are allowed. This will capture the great variability of lengths of CRMs. We evaluate several alignment-free statistics on simulated data and real ChIP-seq sequences. The new statistic is highly successful in discriminating functionally related enhancers and, in almost all experiments, it outperforms fixed-resolution methods. Finally, experiments on mouse enhancers show that Under2 can separate enhancers active in different tissues.

The positioning of nucleosomes along a genome is very important to dictate eukaryotic DNA compaction and access. Current computational methods have focused on the analysis of nucleosome occupancy and the positioning of well-positioned nucleosomes. However, fuzzy nucleosomes require more complex configurations and are more difficult to predict their positions. We analyzed the positioning of well-positioned and fuzzy nucleosomes from a novel structural perspective, and proposed WaveNuc, a computational approach for inferring their positions based on continuous wavelet transformation. The comparative analysis demonstrates that these two kinds of nucleosomes exhibit different propeller twist structural characteristics. Well-positioned nucleosomes tend to locate at sharp peaks of the propeller twist profile, whereas fuzzy nucleosomes correspond to broader peaks. The sharpness of these peaks shows that the propeller twist profile may contain nucleosome positioning information. Exploiting this knowledge, we applied WaveNuc to detect the two different kinds of peaks of the propeller twist profile along the genome. We compared the performance of our method with existing methods on real data sets. The results show that the proposed method can accurately resolve complex configurations of fuzzy nucleosomes, which leads to better performance of nucleosome positioning prediction on the whole genome."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5073","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5073","fieldValue":"ACM"}
