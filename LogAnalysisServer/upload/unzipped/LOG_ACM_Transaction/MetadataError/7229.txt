Ordinary round-robin schedulers are well known for the burstiness of their scheduling output. In order to overcome this problem, SRR codes the weights of the flows into binary vectors to form a Weight Matrix and then uses a Weight Spread Sequence (WSS), which is specially designed to distribute the output more evenly, to schedule packets by scanning a Weight Matrix. By using the WSS and the Weight Matrix, SRR emulates the Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) well. SRR possesses better short-term fairness and scheduling delay properties in comparison with various existing round-robin schedulers. At the same time, SRR preserves O(1) time complexity by avoiding the time-stamp maintenance employed in various fair queueing schedulers. Simulation and implementation experiments show that SRR provides good mean end-to-end delay for soft real-time services. SRR can be implemented in high-speed networks to provide quality of service due to its simplicity and low time complexity."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9276","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9277","fieldValue":"del Angel, Guillermo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9277","fieldValue":" We consider in this study dynamic control policies for Slotted Aloha random access systems. New performance bounds are derived when random access is combined with power control for system optimization, and we establish the existence of optimal control approaches for such systems. We analyze throughput and delay when the number of backlogged users is known, where we can explicitly obtain optimal policies and analyze their corresponding performance using Markov Decision Process (MDP) theory with average cost criterion. For the realistic unknown-backlog case, we establish the existence of optimal backlog-minimizing policies for the same range of arrival rates as the ideal known-backlog case by using the theory of MDPs with Borel state space and unbounded costs. We also propose suboptimal control policies with performance close to the optimal without sacrificing stability. These policies perform substantially better than existing \"Certainty Equivalence\" controllers."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9277","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
