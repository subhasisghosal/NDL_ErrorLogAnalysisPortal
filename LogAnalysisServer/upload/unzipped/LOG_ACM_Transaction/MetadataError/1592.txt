In this work, we interactively manipulate BTFs and create new BTFs from flat textures. We present an out-of-core approach to manage the size of BTFs and introduce new editing operations that modify the appearance of a material. These tools achieve their full potential when selectively applied to subsets of the BTF through the use of new selection operators. We further analyze the use of our editing operators for the modification of important visual characteristics such as highlights, roughness, and fuzziness. Results compare favorably to the direct alteration of micro-geometry and reflectances of synthetic reference data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15810","fieldValue":" We investigate a new approach to editing spatially- and temporally-varying measured materials that adopts a stroke-based workflow. In our system, a user specifies a small number of editing constraints with a 3-D painting interface which are smoothly propagated to the entire dataset through an optimization that enforces similar edits are applied to areas with similar appearance. The sparse nature of this appearance-driven optimization permits the use of efficient solvers, allowing the designer to interactively refine the constraints. We have found this approach supports specifying a wide range of complex edits that would not be easy with existing techniques which present the user with a fixed segmentation of the data. Furthermore, it is independent of the underlying reflectance model and we show edits to both analytic and non-parametric representations in examples from several material databases."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15810","fieldValue":"TSVBRDF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15810","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15810","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15811","fieldValue":" Designing rotational symmetries on surfaces is a necessary task for a wide variety of graphics applications, such as surface parameterization and remeshing, painterly rendering and pen-and-ink sketching, and texture synthesis. In these applications, the topology of a rotational symmetry field such as singularities and separatrices can have a direct impact on the quality of the results. In this paper, we present a design system that provides control over the topology of rotational symmetry fields on surfaces. As the foundation of our system, we provide comprehensive analysis for rotational symmetry fields on surfaces and present efficient algorithms to identify singularities and separatrices. We also describe design operations that allow a rotational symmetry field to be created and modified in an intuitive fashion by using the idea of basis fields and relaxation. In particular, we provide control over the topology of a rotational symmetry field by allowing the user to remove singularities from the field or to move them to more desirable locations. At the core of our analysis and design implementations is the observations that N-way rotational symmetries can be described by symmetric N-th order tensors, which allows an efficient vector-based representation that not only supports coherent definitions of arithmetic operations on rotational symmetries but also enables many analysis and design operations for vector fields to be adapted to rotational symmetry fields. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply our design system to pen-and-ink sketching and geometry remeshing."}
