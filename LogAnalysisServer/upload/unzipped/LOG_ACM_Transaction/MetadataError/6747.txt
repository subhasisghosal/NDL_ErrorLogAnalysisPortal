Our procedure is based on the classic probabilistic result, the birthday paradox. When the transitivity is constant and there are more edges than wedges (common properties for social networks), we can prove that our algorithm requires O(âˆšn) space (n is the number of vertices) to provide accurate estimates. We run a detailed set of experiments on a variety of real graphs and demonstrate that the memory requirement of the algorithm is a tiny fraction of the graph. For example, even for a graph with 200 million edges, our algorithm stores just 40,000 edges to give accurate results. Being a single pass streaming algorithm, our procedure also maintains a real-time estimate of the transitivity\/number of triangles of a graph by storing a minuscule fraction of edges."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7999","fieldValue":"A Space-Efficient Streaming Algorithm for Estimating Transitivity and Triangle Counts Using the Birthday Paradox"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8000","fieldValue":"Tang, Lu-An"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8000","fieldValue":" A cyber-physical system (CPS) integrates physical (i.e., sensor) devices with cyber (i.e., informational) components to form a context-sensitive system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in real-world situations. The CPS has wide applications in scenarios such as environment monitoring, battlefield surveillance, and traffic control. One key research problem of CPS is called mining lines in the sand. With a large number of sensors (sand) deployed in a designated area, the CPS is required to discover all trajectories (lines) of passing intruders in real time. There are two crucial challenges that need to be addressed: (1) the collected sensor data are not trustworthy, and (2) the intruders do not send out any identification information. The system needs to distinguish multiple intruders and track their movements. This study proposes a method called LiSM (Line-in-the-Sand Miner) to discover trajectories from untrustworthy sensor data. LiSM constructs a watching network from sensor data and computes the locations of intruder appearances based on the link information of the network. The system retrieves a cone model from the historical trajectories to track multiple intruders. Finally, the system validates the mining results and updates sensorsâ\u20AC™ reliability scores in a feedback process. In addition, LoRM (Line-on-the-Road Miner) is proposed for trajectory discovery on road networksâ\u20AC\u201Dmining lines on the roads. LoRM employs a filtering-and-refinement framework to reduce the distance computational overhead on road networks and uses a shortest-path-measure to track intruders. The proposed methods are evaluated with extensive experiments on big datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in trajectory mining tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8001","fieldValue":" Empirical risk minimization (ERM) provides a principled guideline for many machine learning and data mining algorithms. Under the ERM principle, one minimizes an upper bound of the true risk, which is approximated by the summation of empirical risk and the complexity of the candidate classifier class. To guarantee a satisfactory learning performance, ERM requires that the training data are i.i.d. sampled from the unknown source distribution. However, this may not be the case in active learning, where one selects the most informative samples to label, and these data may not follow the source distribution. In this article, we generalize the ERM principle to the active learning setting. We derive a novel form of upper bound for the true risk in the active learning setting; by minimizing this upper bound, we develop a practical batch mode active learning method. The proposed formulation involves a nonconvex integer programming optimization problem. We solve it efficiently by an alternating optimization method. Our method is shown to query the most informative samples while preserving the source distribution as much as possible, thus identifying the most uncertain and representative queries. We further extend our method to multiclass active learning by introducing novel pseudolabels in the multiclass case and developing an efficient algorithm. Experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8001","fieldValue":"ACM"}
