In this paper, we define a measure of modularity for interactomes and present a linear-time algorithm, Produles, for detecting multiprotein modularity conserved during evolution that improves on the running time of previous algorithms for related problems and offers desirable theoretical guarantees. We present a biologically motivated graph theoretic set of evaluation measures complementary to previous evaluation measures, demonstrate that Produles exhibits good performance by all measures, and describe certain recurrent anomalies in the performance of previous algorithms that are not detected by previous measures. Consideration of the newly defined measures and algorithm performance on these measures leads to useful insights on the nature of interactomics data and the goals of previous and current algorithms. Through randomization experiments, we demonstrate that conserved modularity is a defining characteristic of interactomes. Computational experiments on current experimentally derived interactomes for Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster, combining results across algorithms, show that nearly 10 percent of current interactome proteins participate in multiprotein modules with good evidence in the protein interaction data of being conserved between human and Drosophila."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4789","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4789","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4789","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4790","fieldValue":"McQuay, Lisa J."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4790","fieldValue":" Assigning biological functions to uncharacterized proteins is a fundamental problem in the postgenomic era. The increasing availability of large amounts of data on protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has led to the emergence of a considerable number of computational methods for determining protein function in the context of a network. These algorithms, however, treat each functional class in isolation and thereby often suffer from the difficulty of the scarcity of labeled data. In reality, different functional classes are naturally dependent on one another. We propose a new algorithm, Multi-label Correlated Semi-supervised Learning (MCSL), to incorporate the intrinsic correlations among functional classes into protein function prediction by leveraging the relationships provided by the PPI network and the functional class network. The guiding intuition is that the classification function should be sufficiently smooth on subgraphs where the respective topologies of these two networks are a good match. We encode this intuition as regularized learning with intraclass and interclass consistency, which can be understood as an extension of the graph-based learning with local and global consistency (LGC) method. Cross validation on the yeast proteome illustrates that MCSL consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. Most notably, it effectively overcomes the problem associated with scarcity of label data.
