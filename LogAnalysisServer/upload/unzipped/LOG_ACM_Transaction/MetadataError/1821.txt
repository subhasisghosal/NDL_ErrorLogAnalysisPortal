Unlike existing Eulerian methods, the proposed framework shows good mass conservation even though it does not employ conventional Lagrangian elements. In addition, it handles complex merging and splitting of interfaces robustly due to the implicit representation. To model the interface more accurately, a high order polynomial reconstruction of the signed distance function is utilized based on a number of sub-grid quadrature points. By combining this accurate polynomial representation with a high-order re-initialization method, the proposed framework preserves the detailed structures of the interface. Moreover, the method is simple to implement, unconditionally stable, and is suitable for parallel computing environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16390","fieldValue":"Chen, Bing-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16390","fieldValue":" Realistic rendering of participating media is one of the major subjects in computer graphics. Monte Carlo techniques are widely used for realistic rendering because they provide unbiased solutions, which converge to exact solutions. Methods based on Monte Carlo techniques generate a number of light paths, each of which consists of a set of randomly selected scattering events. Finding a new scattering event requires free path sampling to determine the distance from the previous scattering event, and is usually a time-consuming process for inhomogeneous participating media. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive and unbiased sampling technique using kd-tree based space partitioning. A key contribution of our method is an automatic scheme that partitions the spatial domain into sub-spaces (partitions) based on a cost model that evaluates the expected sampling cost. The magnitude of performance gain obtained by our method becomes larger for more inhomogeneous media, and rises to two orders compared to traditional free path sampling techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16390","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16390","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16391","fieldValue":"Ragan-Kelley, Jonathan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16391","fieldValue":" Volumetric effects such as beams of light through participating media are an important component in the appearance of the natural world. Many such effects can be faithfully modeled by a single scattering medium. In the presence of shadows, rendering these effects can be prohibitively expensive: current algorithms are based on ray marching, i.e., integrating the illumination scattered towards the camera along each view ray, modulated by visibility to the light source at each sample. Visibility must be determined for each sample using shadow rays or shadow-map lookups. We observe that in a suitably chosen coordinate system, the visibility function has a regular structure that we can exploit for significant acceleration compared to brute force sampling. We propose an efficient algorithm based on partial sum trees for computing the scattering integrals in a single-scattering homogeneous medium. On a CPU, we achieve speedups of 17--120x over ray marching."}
