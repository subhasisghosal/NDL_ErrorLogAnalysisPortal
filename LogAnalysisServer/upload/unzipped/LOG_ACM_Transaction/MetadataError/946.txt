We examine the problem of overcoming the inherent difficulty of concurrent operations on such structures, using a practical storage model. A single additional ‚\u20ACúlink‚\u20AC? pointer in each node allows a process to easily recover from tree modifications performed by other concurrent processes. Our solution compares favorably with earlier solutions in that the locking scheme is simpler (no read-locks are used) and only a (small) constant number of nodes are locked by any update process at any given time. An informal correctness proof for our system is given."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13910","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13910","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2313","fieldValue":" In their seminal paper, Frank and Jord√°n &lsqb;1995&rsqb; show that a large class of optimization problems, including certain directed graph augmentation, fall into the class of covering supermodular functions over pairs of sets. They also give an algorithm for such problems, however, it relies on the ellipsoid method. Prior to our result, combinatorial algorithms existed only for the 0--1 valued problem. Our key result is a combinatorial algorithm for the general problem that includes directed vertex or S‚à\u2019T connectivity augmentation. The algorithm is based on Bencz√∫r's previous algorithm for the 0--1 valued case &lsqb;Bencz√∫r 2003&rsqb;. Our algorithm uses a primal-dual scheme for finding covers of partially ordered sets that satisfy natural abstract properties as in Frank and Jord√°n. For an initial (possibly greedy) cover, the algorithm searches for witnesses for the necessity of each element in the cover. If no two (weighted) witnesses have a common cover, the solution is optimal. As long as this is not the case, the witnesses are gradually exchanged for smaller ones. Each witness change defines an appropriate change in the solution; these changes are finally unwound in a shortest-path manner to obtain a solution of size one less."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2313","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: E&#246;tv&#246;s Univeristy, Budapest (Vgh, Lszl A.); Computer and Automation Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Benczr, Andrs A.)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2313","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2313","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13911","fieldValue":"Larson, Per-ke"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13911","fieldValue":" The gradual performance deterioration caused by deletions from and insertions into an index-sequential file after loading is analyzed.
