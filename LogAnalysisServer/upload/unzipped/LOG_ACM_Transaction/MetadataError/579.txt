{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12853","fieldValue":" Incremental physical CAD is encountered frequently in the so-calledengineering change order (ECO) process in which design changes aremade typically late in the design process in order to correctlogical and\/or technological problems in the circuit. Incrementalrouting is a significant part of an incremental physical designmethodology. Typically after an ECO process, a small portion of thecircuit netlist is changed, and in order to capitalize on theenormous resources and time already spent on routing the circuit itis desirable to reroute only the ECO-affected portion of thecircuit, while minimizing any routing changes in the much largerunaffected part. Incremental rerouting also needs to be fast and toeffectively use available routing resources. In this article, wedevelop a complete incremental routing methodology for FPGAs usinga novel approach called bump and refit (B&R). The basic B&Ridea (which was originally proposed in Dutt et al. [1999] in themuch simpler context of extending some nets by a segment for thepurpose of fault tolerance) in our algorithms is to rearrange someportions of some existing nets on other tracks within their currentchannels in order to find valid routings for the new\/modified netswithout requiring any extra routing resources and with littleeffect on the electrical properties of existing nets. Here wesignificantly extend the B&R concept to global and detailedincremental routing for FPGAs with complex switchboxes (SBox's)such as those in Lucent's ORCA and Xilinx's Virtex series. Weintroduce new concepts such as a B&R cost in global routing andthe optimal subnet set to relocate for each bumped net (determinedusing an efficient dynamic programming formulation). We developedoptimal and near-optimal algorithms (called Subsec_B&R andSubnet_B&R, respectively) to find incremental routing solutionsusing the B&R paradigm in complex FPGAs (e.g.,Lucent&apos;s ORCA FPGA) withi-to-j SBox's, as well as anoptimal version Fullnet_B&R for the VPR architecture from theUniversity of Toronto using the simpleri-to-i SBox&apos;s. Wecompared our algorithms (simply called B&R when no distinctionneeds to be made between our versions) to two recent incrementalrouting techniques, Standard (Std) and Rip-up&Reroute(R&R), and to Lucent's A_PAR routing tool and the University ofToronto's VPR router used in complete rerouting modes. Experimentalresults for the ORCA show that B&R is 10 to 20 times fasterthan complete rerouting using A_PAR, and that B&R is alsonearly 27&percnt; faster and yields new nets with nearly10&percnt; smaller lengths compared to previous incrementalrouters. Furthermore, B&R routers do not change either thelengths or topologies of existing nets, a significant advantage inECO applications, in contrast to R&R which increases the lengthof ripped-up nets by an average of 8.75 to 13.6&percnt;.Experimental results for the VPR architecture are dominated by thesignificantly larger (in many cases, orders of magnitude more)number of nets left unrouted by Std and R&R compared toB&R, which highlights the much greater efficacy ofB&R-based incremental routing. However, B&R issignificantly slower than the other two incremental routers,although on an absolute scale it is quite fast for two of fourcases we simulated; in one case, it is about 25 times faster thanVPR used in the full rerouting mode. The relative slowness ofB&R for the VPR architecture arises from the fact that we usedi-to-i SBox&apos;s whichforces each net to be routed on the same track, thus causingsignificantly more bumpings and searches for rearranged solutionscompared to i-to-jSBox&apos;s where a net can be routed on differentinterconnected tracks to minimize the amount of bumpings (as we didfor the ORCA). Since modern FPGAs generally have the latter type ofSBox&apos;s, B&R would be fast as well as very effective onthem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12853","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12853","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12854","fieldValue":" Inserting controllable\/observable points in the test architecture has been shown to be a viable method for reducing the number of path delay faults that need to be tested in a circuit. In order to have a minimal impact on the operation clock and more accuracy in testing, it is proposed that test points should be inserted with the additional constraint that every path has a bounded number of test points. A polynomial time solvable integer linear programming (ILP) formulation serves as the basis for the presented test placement methodology. Due to the ILP's global optimization property we achieve results that are comparable to those by an existing greedy technique for the less constrained test point placement problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12854","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12854","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12855","fieldValue":"Chang, Yao-Wen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12855","fieldValue":"Wu, Guang-Ming"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12855","fieldValue":" Switch modules are the most important component of the routing resources in FPGAs\/FPICs. Previous works have shown that switch modules with higher routability result in better area performance for practical applications. We consider in this paper an FPGA\/FPIC switch-module analysis problem: the inputs consist of a switch-module description and the number of nets required to be routed through the switch module; the question is to determine if there exists a feasible routing for the routing requirements on the switch module. As a fundamental problem for the analysis of switch modules, this problem is applicable to the design and routability evaluation of FPGA\/FPIC switch modules and FPGA\/FPIC routing. We present a network-flow-based approximation algorithm for this problem. Based on mathematical analyses, we show that this algorithm has provably good performance with the bounds 5 and 5\/4 away from the optima for two types of switch modules, respectively. Extensive experiments show that this algorithm is highly accurate and runs very efficiently."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12855","fieldValue":"FPGA"}
