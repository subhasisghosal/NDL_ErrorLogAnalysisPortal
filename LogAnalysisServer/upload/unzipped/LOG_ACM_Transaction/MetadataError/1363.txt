Dramatic topology reduction is achieved by converting a 3D model to and from a volumetric representation. Our approach produces valid, error-bounded models and supports the creation of approximations that do not interpenetrate the original model, either being completely contained in the input solid or bounding it. Several simple to implement versions of our approach are presented and discussed. We show that these methods perform significantly better than other surface-based approaches when simplifying topologically-rich models such as scene parts and complex mechanical assemblies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15208","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15208","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15209","fieldValue":" We describe an implementation of procedural solid texturing that uses the texture atlas, a one-to-one mapping from an object's surface into its texture space. The method uses the graphics hardware to rasterize the solid texture coordinates as colors directly into the atlas. A texturing procedure is applied per-pixel to the texture map, replacing each solid texture coordinate with its corresponding procedural solid texture result. The procedural solid texture is then mapped back onto the object surface using standard texture mapping. The implementation renders procedural solid textures in real time, and the user can design them interactively.The quality of this technique depends greatly on the layout of the texture atlas. A broad survey of texture atlas schemes is used to develop a set of general purpose mesh atlases and tools for measuring their effectiveness at distributing as many available texture samples as evenly across the surface as possible. The main contribution of this paper is a new multiresolution texture atlas. It distributes all available texture samples in a nearly uniform distribution. This multiresolution texture atlas also supports MIP-mapped minification antialiasing and linear magnification filtering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15209","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15209","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15210","fieldValue":" Color management for the printing of digital images is a challenging task, due primarily to nonlinear ink-mixing behavior and the presence of redundant solutions for print devices with more than three inks. Algorithms for the conversion of image data to printer-specific format are typically designed to achieve a single predetermined rendering intent, such as colorimetric accuracy. In the present paper we present two CIELAB to CMYK color conversion schemes based on a general Pareto-optimal formulation for printer color management. The schemes operate using a 149-color characterization data set selected to efficiently capture the entire CMYK gamut. The first scheme uses artificial neural networks as transfer functions between the CIELAB and CMYK spaces. The second scheme is based on a reformulation of tetrahedral interpolation as an optimization problem. Characterization data are divided into tetrahedra for the interpolation-based approach using the program Qhull, which removes the common restriction that characterization data be well organized. Both schemes offer user control over trade-off problems such as cost versus reproduction accuracy, allowing for user-specified print objectives and the use of constraints such as maximum allowable ink and maximum allowable $Î\u201DE^&ast;ab. A formulation for minimization of ink is shown to be particularly favorable, integrating both clipping and gamut compression features into a single methodology. Codes developed as applications of these schemes were used to convert several CIELAB Tiff images to CMYK format, providing both qualitative and quantitative verification of the Pareto-optimal approach. Prints of the MacBeth ColorCheckertm chart were accurate within approximately to 3 Î\u201DE&ast;$ab for in-gamut colors. Modifications to this approach are presented that offer user control over grey component replacement and provide additional options for rendering intent."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15210","fieldValue":"CMYK"}
