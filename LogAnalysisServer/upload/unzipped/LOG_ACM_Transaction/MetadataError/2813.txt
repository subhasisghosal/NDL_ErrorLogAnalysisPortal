This code can be used to obtain a low- to medium-precision integration for a wide range of problems in the class of oscillatory type, Hamiltonian problems, and time-dependent partial differential equations discretized in space by finite differences or finite elements. The iteration process used in solving for the stage values of the Gauss formula, the selection of the initial step size, and the choice of an appropriate local error estimator for determining the step size change according to a particular tolerance specified by the user are studied. Moreover, a global error estimate and a dense output at equidistant points in the integration interval are supplied with the code. Numerical experiments and some comparisons with certain standard codes on relevant test problems are also given."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19281","fieldValue":"Implicit Runge-Kutta Nystr&ouml;m methods"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19282","fieldValue":" We present two new adaptive quadrature routines. Both routines differ from previously published algorithms in many aspects, most significantly in how they represent the integrand, how they treat nonnumerical values of the integrand, how they deal with improper divergent integrals, and how they estimate the integration error. The main focus of these improvements is to increase the reliability of the algorithms without significantly impacting their efficiency. Both algorithms are implemented in MATLAB and tested using both the â\u20ACœfamiliesâ\u20AC? suggested by Lyness and Kaganove and the battery test used by Gander and Gautschi and Kahaner. They are shown to be more reliable, albeit in some cases less efficient, than other commonly-used adaptive integrators."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19282","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19282","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2865","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2865","fieldValue":"ACM"}
