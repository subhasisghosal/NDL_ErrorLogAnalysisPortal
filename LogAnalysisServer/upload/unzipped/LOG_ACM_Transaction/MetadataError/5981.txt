To explore this design space, we built a probe system we named the Lega. In our 2-month-long research design process, we noted that the usersâ\u20AC™ attention was set on their own reflective experience, rather than attending to the person(s) with which they were sharing their experience. To explain these findings, we present an inductive analysis of the data through a phenomenological lens to pinpoint what causes such behavior. Our analysis extends our understanding of how to design for social embodied interaction, pointing to how we need to embrace the tension between self-reflection and shared experience, making inward listening and social expression visible acts, accessible to social construction and understanding. It entails experiencing our embodied self as others experience us in order to build a dialogue."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5869","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5869","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5870","fieldValue":" Creativity support tools help people engage creatively with the world, but measuring how well a tool supports creativity is challenging since creativity is ill-defined. To this end, we developed the Creativity Support Index (CSI), which is a psychometric survey designed for evaluating the ability of a creativity support tool to assist a user engaged in creative work. The CSI measures six dimensions of creativity support: Exploration, Expressiveness, Immersion, Enjoyment, Results Worth Effort, and Collaboration. The CSI allows researchers to understand not just how well a tool supports creative work overall, but what aspects of creativity support may need attention. In this article, we present the CSI, along with scenarios for how it can be deployed in a variety of HCI research settings and how the CSI scores can help target design improvements. We also present the iterative, rigorous development and validation process used to create the CSI."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5870","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5870","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5871","fieldValue":"Bederson, Benjamin B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5871","fieldValue":" An enormous potential exists for solving certain classes of computational problems through rich collaboration among crowds of humans supported by computers. Solutions to these problems used to involve human professionals, who are expensive to hire or difficult to find. Despite significant advances, fully automatic systems still have much room for improvement. Recent research has involved recruiting large crowds of skilled humans (â\u20ACœcrowdsourcingâ\u20AC?), but crowdsourcing solutions are still restricted by the availability of those skilled human participants. With translation, for example, professional translators incur a high cost and are not always available; machine translation systems have been greatly improved recently but still can only provide passable translation; and crowdsourced translation is limited by the availability of bilingual humans. This article describes crowdsourced monolingual translation, where monolingual translation is translation performed by monolingual people. Crowdsourced monolingual translation is a collaborative form of translation performed by two crowds of people who speak the source or the target language, respectively, with machine translation as the mediating device. This article describes a general protocol to handle crowdsourced monolingual translation and analyzes three systems that implemented the protocol. These systems were studied in various settings and were found to supply significant improvement in quality over both machine translation and monolingual editing of machine translation output (â\u20ACœposteditingâ\u20AC?)."}
