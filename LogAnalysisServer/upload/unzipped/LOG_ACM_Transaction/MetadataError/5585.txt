To fully execute genetic studies of complex diseases, modern geneticists face the challenge of detecting interactions between loci. A genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to detect the association of genotype frequencies of cancer cases and noncancer cases based on statistical analysis. An improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is proposed to improve the reliability of the GA method for high-dimensional SNP-SNP interactions. The strategy offers the top five results to the random population process, in which they guide the GA toward a significant search course. The IGA increases the likelihood of quickly detecting the maximum ratio difference between cancer cases and noncancer cases. The study systematically evaluates the joint effect of 23 SNP combinations of six steroid hormone metabolisms, and signaling-related genes involved in breast carcinogenesis pathways were systematically evaluated, with IGA successfully detecting significant ratio differences between breast cancer cases and noncancer cases. The possible breast cancer risks were subsequently analyzed by odds-ratio (OR) and risk-ratio analysis. The estimated OR of the best SNP barcode is significantly higher than 1 (between 1.15 and 7.01) for specific combinations of two to 13 SNPs. Analysis results support that the IGA provides higher ratio difference values than the GA between breast cancer cases and noncancer cases over 3-SNP to 13-SNP interactions. A more specific SNP-SNP interaction profile for the risk of breast cancer is also provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4906","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4906","fieldValue":"Evaluation of Breast Cancer Susceptibility Using Improved Genetic Algorithms to Generate Genotype SNP Barcodes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4906","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4906","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4907","fieldValue":" An enormous amount of sequence data has been generated with the development of new DNA sequencing technologies, which presents great challenges for computational biology problems such as haplotype phasing. Although arduous efforts have been made to address this problem, the current methods still cannot efficiently deal with the incoming flood of large-scale data. In this paper, we propose a flow network model to tackle haplotype phasing problem, and explain some classical haplotype phasing rules based on this model. By incorporating the heuristic knowledge obtained from these classical rules, we design an algorithm FNphasing based on the flow network model. Theoretically, the time complexity of our algorithm is $(O(n^2m+m^2))$, which is better than that of 2SNP, one of the most efficient algorithms currently. After testing the performance of FNphasing with several simulated data sets, the experimental results show that when applied on large-scale data sets, our algorithm is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art Beagle algorithm. FNphasing also achieves an equal or superior accuracy compared with other approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4907","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4907","fieldValue":"Hidden Markov models,Algorithm design and analysis,Accuracy,Phylogeny,Computational biology,Bioinformatics,Data models,flow network,Hidden Markov models,Algorithm design and analysis,Accuracy,Phylogeny,Computational biology,Bioinformatics,Data models,heuristic methods,Haplotype phasing"}
