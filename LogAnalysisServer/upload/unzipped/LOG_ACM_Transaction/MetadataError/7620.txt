In this paper, we study the problem of \"blind\" estimation of a wireless node's transmit power utilizing solely received power measurements at spatially distributed monitors, without any prior knowledge about the transmitter's location or any statistical characterization of its transmit power. We first consider a deterministic setup and utilize a geometrical approach to obtain fundamental limitations on estimating the transmit power and location of an unknown wireless node. We show that a regular placement of monitors, though appealing, does not provide sufficient measurement diversity to yield a unique estimate. We then extend the setup to consider wireless fading and present a theoretical analysis of maximum likelihood (ML) estimate, which is analytically shown to be asymptotically optimal. Finally, we provide numerical results comparing the performance of the estimator through simulations and on a dataset of field measurements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10049","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10049","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10049","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10050","fieldValue":"Salameh, Haythem A Bany"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10050","fieldValue":" The cognitive radio (CR) paradigm calls for open spectrum access according to a predetermined etiquette. Under this paradigm, CR nodes access the spectrum opportunistically by continuously monitoring the operating channels. A key challenge in this domain is how the nodes in a CR network (CRN) cooperate to access the medium in order to maximize the CRN throughput. Typical multichannel MAC protocols assume that frequency channels are adjacent and that there are no constraints on the transmission power. However, a CRN may operate over a wide range of frequencies, and a power mask is often enforced on the transmission of a CR user to avoid corrupting the transmissions of spectrum-licensed primary-radio (PR) users. To avoid unnecessary blocking of CR transmissions, we propose a novel distance-dependent MAC protocol for CRNs. Our protocol, called DDMAC, attempts to maximize the CRN throughput. It uses a novel probabilistic channel assignment mechanism that exploits the dependence between the signal's attenuation model and the transmission distance while considering the traffic profile. DDMAC allows a pair of CR users to communicate on a channel that may not be optimal from one user's perspective, but that allows more concurrent transmissions to take place, especially under moderate and high traffic loads. Simulation results indicate that, compared to typical multichannel CSMA-based protocols, DDMAC reduces the blocking rate of CR requests by up to 30%, which consequently improves the network throughput."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10050","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10050","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10050","fieldValue":"ACM"}
