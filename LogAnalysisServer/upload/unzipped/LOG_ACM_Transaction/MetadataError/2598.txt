{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18748","fieldValue":" The primary purpose of TSPACK is to construct a smooth function which interpolates a discrete set of data points. The function may be required to have either one or two continuous derivatives. If the accuracy of the data does not warrant interpolation, a smoothing function (which does not pass through the data points) may be constructed instead. The fitting method is designed to avoid extraneous inflection points (associated with rapidly varying data values) and preserve local shape properties of the data (monotonicity and convexity), or to satisfy the more general constraints of bounds on function values or first derivatives. The package also provides a parametric representation for construction general planar curves and space curves."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18749","fieldValue":" An algorithm is presented for computing the decomposition of a tensor product of two irreducible representations of a semisimple complex Lie group into its irreducible components. The algorithm uses a known formula which expresses the multiplicities of the highest weight vectors in the decomposition as an alternating sum indexed by the Weyl group. This sum is accomplished with minimal memory requirements using techniques developed previously by the author for efficiently computing Weyl group orbits. Examples are given for each of the exceptional Lie groups."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18749","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18749","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18750","fieldValue":" We present FORTRAN 77 subroutines that solve statistical parameter estimation problems for general nonlinear models, e.g., nonlinear least-squares, maximum likelihood, maximum quasi-likelihood, generalized nonlinear least-squares, and some robust fitting problems. The accompanying test examples include members of the generalized linear model family, extensions using nonlinear predictors (â\u20ACœnonlinear GLIMâ\u20AC?), and probabilistic choice models, such as linear-in-parameter multinomial probit models. The basic method, a generalization of the NL2SOL algorithm for nonlinear least-squares, employs a model\/trust-region scheme for computing trial steps, exploits special structure by maintaining a secant approximation to the second-order part of the Hessian, and adaptively switches between a Gauss-Newton and an augmented Hessian approximation. Gauss-Newton steps are computed using a corrected seminormal equations approach. The subroutines include variants that handle simple bounds on the parameters, and that compute approximate regression diagnostics."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18750","fieldValue":"Algorithm 717: Subroutines for maximum likelihood and quasi-likelihood estimation of parameters in nonlinear regression models"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18750","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18750","fieldValue":"ACM"}
