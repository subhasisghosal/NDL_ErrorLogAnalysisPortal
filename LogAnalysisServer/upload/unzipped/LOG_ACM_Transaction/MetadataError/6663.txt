{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7739","fieldValue":" Flight delays are frequent all over the world (about 20&percnt; of airline flights arrive more than 15min late) and they are estimated to have an annual cost of billions of dollars. This scenario makes the prediction of flight delays a primary issue for airlines and travelers. The main goal of this work is to implement a predictor of the arrival delay of a scheduled flight due to weather conditions. The predicted arrival delay takes into consideration both flight information (origin airport, destination airport, scheduled departure and arrival time) and weather conditions at origin airport and destination airport according to the flight timetable. Airline flight and weather observation datasets have been analyzed and mined using parallel algorithms implemented as MapReduce programs executed on a Cloud platform. The results show a high accuracy in predicting delays above a given threshold. For instance, with a delay threshold of 15min, we achieve an accuracy of 74.2&percnt; and 71.8&percnt; recall on delayed flights, while with a threshold of 60min, the accuracy is 85.8&percnt; and the delay recall is 86.9&percnt;. Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate the predictor scalability that can be achieved performing data preparation and mining tasks as MapReduce applications on the Cloud."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7739","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7739","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1702","fieldValue":" Postdeployment code dissemination in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is challenging, as the code has to be transmitted via energy-expensive wireless communication. In this article, we propose novel update-conscious compilation (UCC) techniques to achieve energy efficiency. By integrating the compilation decisions in generating the old binary, an update-conscious compiler strives to match the old decisions, which improves the binary code similarity, reduces the amount of transmitted data to remote sensors, and thus, consumes less energy. In this article, we develop update-conscious register allocation and data layout algorithms. Our experimental results show great improvements over the traditional, update-oblivious approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1702","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1702","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7740","fieldValue":" Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the typical movement disorder diseases among elderly people, which has a serious impact on their daily lives. In this article, we propose a novel computation framework to recognize gait patterns in patients with PD. The key idea of our approach is to distinguish gait patterns in PD patients from healthy individuals by accurately extracting gait features that capture all three aspects of movement functions, that is, stability, symmetry, and harmony. The proposed framework contains three steps: gait phase discrimination, feature extraction and selection, and pattern classification. In the first step, we put forward a sliding window--based method to discriminate four gait phases from plantar pressure data. Based on the gait phases, we extract and select gait features that characterize stability, symmetry, and harmony of movement functions. Finally, we recognize PD gait patterns by applying a hybrid classification model. We evaluate the framework using an open dataset that contains real plantar pressure data of 93 PD patients and 72 healthy individuals. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms the four baseline approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/7740","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Institut Mines-T&#233;l&#233;com\/T&#233;l&#233;com SudParis, France (Zhang, Daqing); RMIT University, Melbourne VIC, Australia (Gu, Tao); School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an Shaanxi, China (Wang, Tianben; Wang, Zhu; Ni, Hongbo; Jia, Jiangbo; Zhou, Xingshe); Zhuhai Kingsoft Office Software Co., Ltd, Zhuhai Guangdong, China (Lv, Jing)"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/7740","fieldValue":"Parkinson&rsquo;s disease"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7740","fieldValue":"ACM"}
