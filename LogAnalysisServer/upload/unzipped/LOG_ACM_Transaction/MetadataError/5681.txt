In the renowned literature, the synthetic genetic oscillator, known as a repressilator, has been successfully built in Escherichia coli to generate a periodic oscillating phenomenon through three repressive genes repress each other in a chain. On the basis of this fact, our proposed genetic frequency multiplier circuit utilizes genetic Buffers in series with a waveform-shaping circuit to reshape the genetic oscillation signal into a crisp logic clock signal. By regulating different threshold levels in the Buffer, the time length of logic high\/low levels in a fundamental sinusoidal wave can be engineered to pulse-width-modulated (PWM) signals with various duty cycles. Integrating some of genetic logic XOR gates and PWM signals from the output of the Buffers, a genetic frequency multiplier circuit can be created and the clock signal with the integer-fold of frequency of the genetic oscillator is generated. The synthesized signal can be used in triggering the downstream digital genetic logic circuits. Simulation results show the applicability of the proposed idea."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5080","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5080","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5080","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5081","fieldValue":" Accurate and robust detection of myonuclei in isolated single muscle fibers is required to calculate myonuclear domain size. However, this task is challenging because: 1) shape and size variations of the nuclei, 2) overlapping nuclear clumps, and 3) multiple z-stack images with out-of-focus regions. In this paper, we have proposed a novel automatic detection algorithm to robustly quantify myonuclei in isolated single skeletal muscle fibers. The original z-stack images are first converted into one all-in-focus image using multi-focus image fusion. A sufficient number of ellipse fitting hypotheses are then generated from the myonuclei contour segments using heteroscedastic errors-in-variables (HEIV) regression. A set of representative training samples and a set of discriminative features are selected by a two-stage sparse model. The selected samples with representative features are utilized to train a classifier to select the best candidates. A modified inner geodesic distance based mean-shift clustering algorithm is used to produce the final nuclei detection results. The proposed method was extensively tested using 42 sets of z-stack images containing over 1,500 myonuclei. The method demonstrates excellent results that are better than current state-of-the-art approaches."}
