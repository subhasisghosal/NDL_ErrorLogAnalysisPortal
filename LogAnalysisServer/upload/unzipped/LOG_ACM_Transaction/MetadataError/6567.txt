Currently, a popular Web search engine may receive billions of queries and collect terabytes of records about user search behavior daily. Beside search log data, huge amounts of browse log data have also been collected through client-side browser plugins. Such massive amounts of search and browse log data provide great opportunities for mining the wisdom of crowds and improving Web search. At the same time, designing effective and efficient methods to clean, process, and model log data also presents great challenges. In this survey, we focus on mining search and browse log data for Web search. We start with an introduction to search and browse log data and an overview of frequently-used data summarizations in log mining. We then elaborate how log mining applications enhance the five major components of a search engine, namely, query understanding, document understanding, document ranking, user understanding, and monitoring and feedback. For each aspect, we survey the major tasks, fundamental principles, and state-of-the-art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7499","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7499","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7500","fieldValue":" Visual object tracking is a significant computer vision task which can be applied to many domains, such as visual surveillance, human computer interaction, and video compression. Despite extensive research on this topic, it still suffers from difficulties in handling complex object appearance changes caused by factors such as illumination variation, partial occlusion, shape deformation, and camera motion. Therefore, effective modeling of the 2D appearance of tracked objects is a key issue for the success of a visual tracker. In the literature, researchers have proposed a variety of 2D appearance models. To help readers swiftly learn the recent advances in 2D appearance models for visual object tracking, we contribute this survey, which provides a detailed review of the existing 2D appearance models. In particular, this survey takes a module-based architecture that enables readers to easily grasp the key points of visual object tracking. In this survey, we first decompose the problem of appearance modeling into two different processing stages: visual representation and statistical modeling. Then, different 2D appearance models are categorized and discussed with respect to their composition modules. Finally, we address several issues of interest as well as the remaining challenges for future research on this topic. The contributions of this survey are fourfold. First, we review the literature of visual representations according to their feature-construction mechanisms (i.e., local and global). Second, the existing statistical modeling schemes for tracking-by-detection are reviewed according to their model-construction mechanisms: generative, discriminative, and hybrid generative-discriminative. Third, each type of visual representations or statistical modeling techniques is analyzed and discussed from a theoretical or practical viewpoint. Fourth, the existing benchmark resources (e.g., source codes and video datasets) are examined in this survey."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7500","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7500","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7501","fieldValue":" The Social Web is now a successful reality with its quickly growing number of users and applications. Also the Semantic Web, which started with the objective of describing Web resources in a machine-processable way, is now outgrowing the research labs and is being massively exploited in many websites, incorporating high-quality user-generated content and semantic annotations. The primary goal of this special section is to showcase some recent research at the intersection of the Social Web and the Semantic Web that explores the benefits that adaptation and personalization have to offer in the Web of the future, the so-called Social Adaptive Semantic Web. We have selected two articles out of fourteen submissions based on the quality of the articles and we present the main lessons learned from the overall analysis of these submissions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7501","fieldValue":"ACM"}
