In this paper we attempt to quantify the threat of browsers being indirectly misused for attacking third parties. Specifically, we look at how the existing Web infrastructure (e.g., the languages, protocols, and security policies) can be exploited by malicious or subverted Web sites to remotely instruct browsers to orchestrate actions including denial of service attacks, worm propagation, and reconnaissance scans. We show that attackers are able to create powerful botnet-like infrastructures that can cause significant damage. We explore the effectiveness of countermeasures including anomaly detection and more fine-grained browser security policies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22267","fieldValue":" Laundering e-mail spam through open-proxies or compromised PCs is a widely-used trick to conceal real spam sources and reduce spamming cost in the underground e-mail spam industry. Spammers have plagued the Internet by exploiting a large number of spam proxies. The facility of breaking spam laundering and deterring spamming activities close to their sources, which would greatly benefit not only e-mail users but also victim ISPs, is in great demand but still missing. In this article, we reveal one salient characteristic of proxy-based spamming activities, namely packet symmetry, by analyzing protocol semantics and timing causality. Based on the packet symmetry exhibited in spam laundering, we propose a simple and effective technique, DBSpam, to online detect and break spam laundering activities inside a customer network. Monitoring the bidirectional traffic passing through a network gateway, DBSpam utilizes a simple statistical method, Sequential Probability Ratio Test, to detect the occurrence of spam laundering in a timely manner. To balance the goals of promptness and accuracy, we introduce a noise-reduction technique in DBSpam, after which the laundering path can be identified more accurately. Then DBSpam activates its spam suppressing mechanism to break the spam laundering. We implement a prototype of DBSpam based on libpcap, and validate its efficacy on spam detection and suppression through both theoretical analyses and trace-based experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22268","fieldValue":"Venkatakrishnan, V N"}
