It is one of the simplest applications of natural-language processing to IR and is one of the most effective in terms of user acceptance and consistency, though small retrieval improvements. Current stemming techniques do not, however, reflect the language use in specific corpora, and this can lead to occasional serious retrieval failures. We propose a technique for using corpus-based word variant cooccurrence statistics to modify or create a stemmer. The experimental results generated using English newspaper and legal text and Spanish text demonstrate the viability of this technique and its advantages relative to conventional approaches that only employ morphological rules."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3309","fieldValue":" High dynamic-range images cannot be directly displayed on conventional display devices, but have to be tone-mapped first. For this purpose, a large set of tone-reproduction operators is currently available. However, it is unclear which operator is most suitable for any given task. In addition, different tasks may place different requirements upon each operator. In this paper we evaluate several tone-reproduction operators using a paradigm that does not require the construction of a real high dynamic-range scene, nor does it require the availability of a high dynamic-range display device. The user study involves a task that relates to the evaluation of contrast, which is an important attribute that needs to be preserved under tone reproduction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23787","fieldValue":" One of the most intriguing lines of research within the literature on diffusion of information technologies (IT) is the study of the power and politics of this process. The major objective of this article is to build on the work of Kling and Markus on power and IT, by extending their perspective to email. To demonstrate how email can be used for political purposes within an organizational context, a case study is presented. The case study describes a series of events which took place in a university. In the case, email was used by a group of employees to stage a rebellion against the university president. The discussion demonstrates that email features make it amenable to a range of political uses. The article is concluded with a discussion of the implications from this case to email research and practice."}
