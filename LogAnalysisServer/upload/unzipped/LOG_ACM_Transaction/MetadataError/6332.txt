{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6847","fieldValue":" Recent process technology advances trigger reliability issues that degrade the Quality-of-Service (QoS) required by embedded Systems-on-Chip (SoCs). To maintain the required QoS with acceptable overheads, we propose OCEAN, a novel cross-layer error mitigation. OCEAN enforces on-chip SRAMs reliability with a fault-tolerant buffer. We utilize this buffer to protect a portion of the processed data used to restore from runtime error. We optimally select the buffer size to minimize the energy overhead, with timing and area constraints. OCEAN achieves full error mitigation with 10.1&percnt; average energy overhead compared to base-line operation that does not include any error correction capability, and 65&percnt; energy savings, compared to a cross-layer error mitigation mechanism."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6847","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6847","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6848","fieldValue":"Al-Dujaily, Raed"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6848","fieldValue":" The substantial silicon density in 3D VLSI, albeit its numerous advantages, introduces serious thermal threats that would lead to faults and system failures. This article introduces a new strategy to effectively diffuse heat from NoC-based 3D CMPs. Runtime Dynamic Programming Network (DPN) is proposed to optimize routing directions and provide silicon temperature moderation. Both on-chip reliability and computational performance have been improved by 63&percnt; and 27&percnt;, respectively, with the DPN approach.
