This raises the need for scalable resource selection services that identify resources that match application requirements. Such a service must provide an efficient lookup in spite of changing resource attributes such as disk size, changing application requirements such as installed software libraries, and changing system composition as resources join or leave. We present a fully decentralized, self-managing Resource Selection Service (RSS) algorithm by which resources autonomously select themselves when their attributes match a query. An application specifies what it expects from a resource by means of a conjunction of (attribute,value-range) pairs, which are matched against the attribute values of resources. The set of search attributes can also be updated online to reflect new requirements. We show that our solution scales in the number of resources and in the number of attributes, while being relatively insensitive to churn and other membership changes like node failures. Our RSS continuously self-adapts its routing structure in response to variations in the distribution of node attributes and queries. We show that this autonomous optimization maintains performance and availability in a long-lived service even when the set of application requirements used to select resources changes."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1260","fieldValue":"RSS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1260","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1260","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25416","fieldValue":" In recent years, there have been ever-growing geographical tagged photos on the community Web sites such as Flickr. Discovering touristic landmarks from these photos can help us to make better sense of our visual world. In this article, we report our work on mining landmarks from geotagged Flickr photos for city scene summarization and touristic recommendations. We begin by exploring the geographical and visual statistics of the Web users' photographing manner, based on which we conduct landmark mining in two steps: First, we propose to partition each city into geographical regions based on spectral clustering over the geotags of Flickr photos. Second, in each landmark region, we present a representative photo mining scheme based on sparse representation. Our main idea is to regard the landmark mining problem as a process to find photos whose visual signatures can be reconstructed using other photos of this landmark region with a minimal coding length. This sparse reconstruction scheme offers a general perspective to mine the representative photos. Indeed, by simplifying the data correlation constraints in our scheme, several previous works in representative photo discovery and landmark mining can be derived. Finally, we introduce a Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search model to refine our landmark ranking, which incorporates the community knowledge to simulate the landmark ranking problem as a dynamic page ranking problem. We have deployed our proposed landmark mining framework on a city scene summarization and navigation system, which works on one million geotagged Flickr photos coming from twenty worldwide metropolises. We have also quantitatively compared our scheme with several state-of-the-art works."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25417","fieldValue":" This article examines the use of two kinds of context to improve the results of content-based music taggers: the relationships between tags and between the clips of songs that are tagged.
