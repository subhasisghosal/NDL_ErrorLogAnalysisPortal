The operator of such networks is often required to maximize the available throughput while guaranteeing its restorability. This paper is the first to combine these seemingly conflicting goals into one optimization criterion: maximizing the restorable throughput of the end-to-end paths. We address this problem in three cases: when the operator has no knowledge of the future bandwidth demands, when it has partial knowledge, and when it has full knowledge. We present efficient algorithms for each of these cases and use extensive simulations to compare their performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/10996","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Dept. of Comput.

The Local Pooling LoP factor provides a single-parameter means of expressing the achievable capacity region and optimality of one such scheme, greedy maximal scheduling GMS. The exact LoP factor for an arbitrary network graph is generally difficult to obtain, but may be evaluated or bounded based on the network graph's particular structure. In this paper, we provide rigorous characterizations of the LoP factor in large networks modeled as ErdoÌˆs-ReÌ?nyi ER and random geometric RG graphs under the primary interference model. We employ threshold functions to establish critical values for either the edge probability or communication radius to yield useful bounds on the range and expectation of the LoP factor as the network grows large. For sufficiently dense random graphs, we find that the LoP factor is between 1\/2 and 2\/3, while sufficiently sparse random graphs permit GMS optimality the LoP factor is 1 with high probability. We then place LoP within a larger context of commonly studied random graph properties centered around connectedness. We observe that edge densities permitting connectivity generally admit cycle subgraphs that form the basis for the LoP factor upper bound of 2\/3. We conclude with simulations to explore the regime of small networks, which suggest the probability that an ER or RG graph satisfies LoP and is connected decays quickly in network size."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/10997","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Dept. of Electr. &amp; Comput.
