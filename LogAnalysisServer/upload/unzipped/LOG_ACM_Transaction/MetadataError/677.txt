{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13088","fieldValue":" Many system-on-chip (SoC) integrated circuits contain embedded cores with different scan frequencies. To better meet the test requirements for such heterogeneous SoCs, leading tester companies have recently introduced port-scalable testers, which can simultaneously drive groups of channels at different data rates. However, the number of tester channels available for scan testing is limited; therefore, a higher shift frequency can increase the test time for a core if the resulting test access architecture reduces the bit-width used to access it. We present a scalable test planning technique that exploits port scalability of testers to reduce SoC test time. We compare the proposed heuristic optimization method to two baseline methods based on prior works that use a single scan data rate for all embedded cores. We also propose a power-aware test planning technique to effectively utilize port-scalable testers under constraints of test power consumption. Experimental results are presented for power-aware test scheduling to illustrate the impact of power constraints on overall test time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13088","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13088","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13089","fieldValue":" This article presents a new real-world application of evolutionary computing in the area of digital-circuits testing. A method is described which enables to evolve large synthetic RTL benchmark circuits with a predefined structure and testability. Using the proposed method, a new collection of synthetic benchmark circuits was developed. These benchmark circuits will be useful in a validation process of novel algorithms and tools in the area of digital-circuits testing. Evolved benchmark circuits currently represent the most complex benchmark circuits with a known level of testability. Furthermore, these circuits are the largest that have ever been designed by means of evolutionary algorithms. This work also investigates suitable parameters of the evolutionary algorithm for this problem and explores the limits in the complexity of evolved circuits."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13089","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13089","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13090","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13091","fieldValue":" Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are very popular in today's embedded systems design, and Partial Runtime-Reconfigurable (PRTR) FPGAs allow HW tasks to be placed and removed dynamically at runtime. Hardware task scheduling on PRTR FPGAs brings many challenging issues to traditional real-time scheduling theory, which have not been adequately addressed by the research community compared to software task scheduling on CPUs. In this article, we consider the schedulability analysis problem of HW task scheduling on PRPR FPGAs. We derive utilization bounds for several variants of global preemptive\/nonpreemptive EDF scheduling, and compare the performance of different utilization bound tests."}
