Early structured overlays realized distributed hash tables (DHTs) which are ill suited for anything but exact queries. The need to support range queries necessitates systems that can handle uneven load distributions. However such systems suffer from practical problemsâ\u20AC\u201Dincluding poor latency, disproportionate bandwidth usage at participating peers, or unrealistic assumptions on peers' homogeneity, in terms of available storage or bandwidth resources. In this article we consider a system that is not only able to support uneven load distributions but also to operate in heterogeneous environments, where each peer can autonomously decide how much of its resources to contribute to the system. We provide the theoretical foundations of realizing such a network and present a newly proposed system Oscar based on these principles. Oscar can construct efficient overlays given arbitrary load distributions by employing a novel scalable network sampling technique. The simulations of our system validate the theory and evaluate Oscar's performance under typical challenges, encountered in real-life large-scale networked systems, including participant heterogeneity, faults, and skewed and dynamic load-distributions. Thus the Oscar distributed index fills in an important gap in the family of structured overlays, bringing into life a practical Internet-scale index, which can play a crucial role in enabling data-oriented applications distributed over wide-area networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1180","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1180","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2549","fieldValue":" We give the first polynomial-time algorithm for checking whether the Galois group Gal(f) of an input polynomial f(X) âˆˆ Q[X] is nilpotent: the running time of our algorithm is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the coefficients of f and the degree of f.

Our approach takes advantage of the fact that the sound generated by liquid is mainly due to the vibration of resonating bubbles in the medium and performs automatic sound synthesis by coupling physically-based equations for bubble resonance with multiple fluid simulators. We effectively demonstrate our system on several benchmarks using a real-time shallow-water fluid simulator as well as a hybrid grid-SPH simulator."}
