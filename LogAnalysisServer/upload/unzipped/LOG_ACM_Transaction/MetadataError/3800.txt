The ensuing variants definitely improve the original trade-off but their real impact has never been evaluated in practice. We fill this lack by analyzing the perfect form of classic tables, distinguished point-based tables, and rainbow tables. We especially provide a thorough analysis of the latter variant, whose performances have never been formally calculated yet. Our analysis leads to the concept of a characteristic that enables to measure the intrinsic quality of a trade-off. We finally introduce a new technique based on checkpoints that still reduces the cryptanalysis time by ruling out false alarms probabilistically. Our analysis yields the exact gain of this approach and establishes its efficiency when applied on rainbow tables."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22248","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22248","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22249","fieldValue":" Hop-by-hop data aggregation is a very important technique for reducing the communication overhead and energy expenditure of sensor nodes during the process of data collection in a sensor network. However, because individual sensor readings are lost in the per-hop aggregation process, compromised nodes in the network may forge false values as the aggregation results of other nodes, tricking the base station into accepting spurious aggregation results. Here a fundamental challenge is how can the base station obtain a good approximation of the fusion result when a fraction of sensor nodes are compromised? To answer this challenge, we propose SDAP, a Secure Hop-by-hop Data Aggregation Protocol for sensor networks. SDAP is a general-purpose secure data aggregation protocol applicable to multiple aggregation functions. The design of SDAP is based on the principles of divide-and-conquer and commit-and-attest. First, SDAP uses a novel probabilistic grouping technique to dynamically partition the nodes in a tree topology into multiple logical groups (subtrees) of similar sizes. A commitment-based hop-by-hop aggregation is performed in each group to generate a group aggregate. The base station then identifies the suspicious groups based on the set of group aggregates. Finally, each group under suspect participates in an attestation process to prove the correctness of its group aggregate. The aggregate by the base station is calculated over all the group aggregates that are either normal or have passed the attestation procedure. Extensive analysis and simulations show that SDAP can achieve the level of efficiency close to an ordinary hop-by-hop aggregation protocol while providing high assurance on the trustworthiness of the aggregation result. Last, prototype implementation on top of TinyOS shows that our scheme is practical on current generation sensor nodes such as Mica2 motes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22250","fieldValue":"Baras, John S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22250","fieldValue":" The widespread deployment of wireless networks and hot spots that employ the IEEE 802.11 technology has forced network designers to put emphasis on the importance of ensuring efficient and fair use of network resources. In this work we propose a novel framework for detection of intelligent adaptive adversaries in the IEEE 802.11 MAC by addressing the problem of detection of the worst-case scenario attacks. Utilizing the nature of this protocol we employ sequential detection methods for detecting greedy behavior and illustrate their performance for detection of least favorable attacks. By using robust statistics in our problem formulation, we attempt to utilize the precision given by parametric tests, while avoiding the specification of the adversarial distribution. This approach establishes the lowest performance bound of a given Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in terms of detection delay and is applicable in online detection systems where users who pay for their services want to obtain the information about the best and the worst case scenarios and performance bounds of the system. This framework is meaningful for studying misbehavior due to the fact that it does not focus on specific adversarial strategies and therefore is applicable to a wide class of adversarial strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22250","fieldValue":"ACM"}
