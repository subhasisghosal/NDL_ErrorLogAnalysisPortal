This problem is NP-hard. In this paper, two heuristics, the limited granularity heuristic and the limited path heuristic, are investigated. Both heuristics extend the Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm and solve general k-constrained QoS routing problems. Analytical and simulation studies are conducted to compare the time\/space requirements of the heuristics and the effectiveness of the heuristics in finding paths that satisfy the QoS constraints. The major results of this paper are the following. For an N-nodes and E-edges network with k (a small constant) independent QoS constraints, the limited granularity heuristic must maintain a table of size $O(|N|^k- 1) in each node to be effective, which results in a time complexity of O (|N|K|E|); while the limited path heuristic can achieve very high performance by maintaining O (|N|2$lg(|N|)) entries in each node. These results indicate that the limited path heuristic is relatively insensitive to the number of constraints and is superior to the limited granularity heuristic in solving k-constrained QoS routing problems when k > 3."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9090","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9090","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9091","fieldValue":"Wong, K.

The traditional trunk reservation policy and its numerous variants give preferential treatment to the handoff calls over new arrivals by reserving a number of radio channels exclusively for handoffs. Such schemes, however, cannot adapt to changes in traffic pattern due to the static nature. This paper introduces a novel stable dynamic call admission control mechanism (SDCA), which can maximize the radio channel utilization subject to a predetermined bound on the call dropping probability. The novelties of the proposed mechanism are: 1) it is adaptive to wide range of system parameters and traffic conditions due to its dynamic nature; 2) the control is stable under overloading traffic conditions, thus can effectively deal with sudden traffic surges; 3) the admission policy is stochastic, thus spreading new arrivals evenly over a control period, and resulting in more effective and accurate control; and 4) the model takes into account the effects of limited channel capacity and time dependence on the call dropping probability, and the influences from nearest and next-nearest neighboring cells, which greatly improve the control precision. In addition, we introduce local control algorithms based on strictly local estimations of the needed traffic parameters, without requiring the status information exchange among different cells, which makes it very appealing in actual implementation. Most of the computational complexities lie in off-line precalculations, except for the nonlinear equation of the acceptance ratio, in which a coarse-grain numerical integration is shown to be sufficient for stochastic control. Extensive simulation results show that our scheme steadily satisfies the hard constraint on call dropping probability while maintaining a high channel throughput."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9091","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9091","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9091","fieldValue":"A dynamic call admission policy with precision QoS guarantee using stochastic control for mobile wireless networks"}
