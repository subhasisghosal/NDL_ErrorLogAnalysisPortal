This assumption is too restrictive when access control restrictions to be enforced come from the combination of different policy specifications, each possibly under the control of independent authorities, and where the specifics of some component policies may not even be known apriori. Turning individual specifications into a coherent policy to be fed into the access control system requires a nontrivial combination and translation process. This article addresses the problem of combining authorization specifications that may be independently stated, possibly in different languages and according to different policies. We propose an algebra of security policies together with its formal semantics and illustrate how to formulate complex policies in the algebra and reason about them. A translation of policy expressions into equivalent logic programs is illustrated, which provides the basis for the implementation of the algebra. The algebra's expressiveness is analyzed through a comparison with first-order logic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22128","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22128","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22129","fieldValue":" We present a detailed analysis of the UNIX system calls and classify them according to their level of threat with respect to system penetration. Based on these results, an effective mechanism is proposed to control the invocation of critical, from the security viewpoint, system calls. The integration into existing UNIX operating systems is carried out by instrumenting the code of the system calls in such a way that the execution is granted only in the case where the invoking process and the value of the arguments comply with the rules held in an access control database. This method does not require changes in the kernel data structures and algorithms. All kernel modifications are transparent to the application processes that continue to work correctly with no need of source code changes or recompilation. A working prototype has been implemented as a loadable kernel module for the Linux operating system. The prototype is able to detect and block any attacks by which an intruder tries to gain direct access to the system as a privileged user."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22129","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22129","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22130","fieldValue":" The term information portals refers to Web sites that serve as main providers of focused information, gathered from distributed data sources. Gathering and disseminating information through information portals introduce new security challenges. In particular, the authorization specifications, as well as the granting process, are temporal by nature. Also, more often than not, the information provided by the portal is in fact derived from more than one backend data source. Therefore, any authorization model for information portals should support access control based on temporal characteristics of the data, and also should provide tools to prevent indirect unauthorized access through the use of derived data. In this article we focus our attention on devising such an authorization model. The distinguishing features of this model include: (1) the specification of authorizations based on temporal characteristics of data, and (2) a formal framework to derive authorizations in a consistent and safe manner, based on relationships among data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22130","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22130","fieldValue":"ACM"}
