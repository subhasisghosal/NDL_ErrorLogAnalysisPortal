Due to the advance in recent heterogeneous architecture, there has been a resurgence in research aimed at domain-specific accelerators. In this article, we develop an experimental system SuperDragon for evaluating acceleration of a single-particle Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) 3D reconstruction package EMAN through a hybrid of CPU, GPU, and FPGA parallel architecture. Based on a comprehensive workload characterization, we exploit multigrained parallelism in the Cryo-EM 3D reconstruction algorithm and investigate a proper computational mapping to the underlying heterogeneous architecture. The package is restructured with task-level (MPI), thread-level (OpenMP), and data-level (GPU and FPGA) parallelism. Especially, the proposed FPGA accelerator is a stream architecture that emphasizes the importance of optimizing computing dominated data access patterns. Besides, the configurable computing streams are constructed by arranging the hardware modules and bypassing channels to form a linear deep pipeline. Compared to the multicore (six-core) program, the GPU and FPGA implementations achieve speedups of 8.4 and 2.25 times in execution time while improving power efficiency by factors of 7.2 and 14.2, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21913","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21913","fieldValue":"SuperDragon: A Heterogeneous Parallel System for Accelerating 3D Reconstruction of Cryo-Electron Microscopy Images"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21913","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21913","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21914","fieldValue":"Huss, Sorin A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21914","fieldValue":" Multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) architectures are a huge challenge in embedded system design. This situation arises from the fact that available MPSoCs and related designs flows are not tailored to the specific needs of embedded systems. This work demonstrates how to provide self-healing properties in embedded MPSoC design. This is achieved by combining the features of a generic approach to create virtualizable MPSoCs out of off-the-shelf embedded processors with a methodology to derive system configurations, such as task-processor bindings, which are optimal in terms of safety and execution time. The virtualization properties enable a reshaping of the MPSoC at runtime. Thus, system configurations may be exchanged rapidly in a dynamic fashion. As a main result of this work, embedded multiprocessor systems are introduced, which dynamically adapt to changing operating conditions, possible module defects, and internal state changes. We demonstrate the figures of merit of such reconfigurable MPSoC embedded systems by means of a complex automotive application scenario mapped to an FPGA featuring a virtualizable array of eight soft-core processors."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21914","fieldValue":"Safe Dynamic Reshaping of Reconfigurable MPSoC Embedded Systems for Self-Healing and Self-Adaption Purposes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21914","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21914","fieldValue":"ACM"}
