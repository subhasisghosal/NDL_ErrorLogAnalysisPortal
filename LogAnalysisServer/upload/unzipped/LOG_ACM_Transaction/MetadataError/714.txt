We propose a new approach, called ParThermPOF, to build the parameterized thermal performance models from the given accurate architecture thermal and power information. The new method can include a number of variable parameters such as the locations of thermal sensors in a heat sink, different components (heat sink, heat spreader, core, cache, etc.), thermal conductivity of heat sink materials, etc. The method consists of two steps: first, a response surface method based on low-order polynomials is applied to build the parameterized models at each time point for all the given sampling nodes in the parameter space. Second, an improved Generalized Pencil-Of-Function (GPOF) method is employed to build the transfer-function-based behavioral models for each time-varying coefficient of the polynomials generated in the first step. Experimental results on a practical quad-core microprocessor show that the generated parameterized thermal model matches the given data very well. The compact models by ParThermPOF offer two order of magnitudes speedup over the commercial thermal analysis tool FloTHERM on the given examples. ParThermPOF is very suitable for design space exploration and optimization where both time and system parameters need to be considered."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13175","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13175","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13176","fieldValue":" For Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS), we propose a novel design methodology. This methodology is composed of an error detection circuit and three technologies to reduce the area and power penalties which are the large issues for the conventional DVS with error detection. The proposed circuit, Phase-Adjustable Error Detection Flip-Flip (PEDFF), adjusts the clock phase of an additional FF for the timing error detection, based on the timing slack. 2-Stage Hold-Driven Optimization (2-SHDO) technology splits the hold-driven optimization in two stages. Slack-Based Grouping Scheme (SBGS) technology divides each timing path into appropriate groups based on the timing slack. Slack Distribution Control (SDC) technology improves the sharp distribution of the path delay at which the logic synthesis tool has relaxed the delay. We evaluate the methodology by simulating a 32-bit microprocessor in 90 nm CMOS technology. The proposed methodology reduces the energy consumption by 19.8&percnt; compared to non-DVS. The OR-tree's latency is shortened to 16.3&percnt; compared to the conventional DVS. The area and power penalties for delay buffers on short paths are reduced to 35.0&percnt; and 40.6&percnt; compared to the conventional DVS, respectively. The proposed methodology with SDC reduces the energy consumption by 17.0&percnt; on another example with the sharp slack distribution by the logic synthesis compared to non-DVS."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13176","fieldValue":"CTS"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13176","fieldValue":"DVS"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13176","fieldValue":"P&R"}
