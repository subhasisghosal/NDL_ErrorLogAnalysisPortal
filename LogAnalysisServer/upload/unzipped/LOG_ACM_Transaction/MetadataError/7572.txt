Our analysis generalizes previous results obtained under restrictive assumptions on the node mobility process and overall node density over the network area. The broader family of mobile networks that we consider is able to account for many important characteristics usually recognized in real traces of both human and vehicular mobility. In particular, we consider clustered networks of heterogeneous nodes, in which the shape of the spatial distribution of each node around one or more home-points plays a fundamental role in determining the overall transport capacity. We identify different operational regimes that arise within our general class of mobile networks, and for each regime we characterize the asymptotic network capacity."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9951","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9952","fieldValue":" We study the problem of information brokerage in sensor networks, where information consumers (sinks, users) search for data acquired by information producers (sources). In-network storage such as geographical hash table (GHT) has been proposed to store data at rendezvous nodes for consumers to retrieve. In this paper, we propose a double rulings scheme that stores data replicas on a curve instead of one or multiple isolated sensors. The consumer travels along another curve that is guaranteed to intersect the producer curve. The double rulings is a natural extension of the flat hashing scheme such as GHTs. It has improved query locality--i.e., consumers close to producers find the data quickly--and structured aggregate queries, i.e., a consumer following a curve is able to retrieve all the data. Furthermore, by the flexibility of retrieval mechanisms, we have better routing robustness (as multiple retrieval paths are available) and data robustness against regional node failures. We show by simulation that the double rulings scheme provides reduced communication costs and more balanced traffic load on the sensors."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9952","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9953","fieldValue":"Lin, Wei-Ming"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9953","fieldValue":" Computer networks have continued to make substantial advances in the past couple of decades through better technologies and methodologies employed. As the usage of the networks continues to increase exponentially, high throughput of the networks has to be maintained with various performance-efficient network algorithms. IP address lookup is one of the processes, the performance of which dearly affects the overall network performance. Hashing has been widely used for fast IP address lookup due to its simplicity, but mostly assuming on hashing from an address set with uniformly distributed key values. Performance from these known hashing techniques is far from optimal due to the high nonuniformity in actual IP address distribution. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing method for the IP address databases to extract certain regularity to allow for design of more efficient hashing algorithms based on XOR operations. Simulation results show an improvement in performance ranging from 35% to 72% on randomly generated addresses and several sample IP address databases. The paper also shows that the proposed algorithms deliver comparable performance to other well-known hashing algorithms such as the CRC and RS hashing while requiring much less hardware to implement and a much shorter time to perform."}
