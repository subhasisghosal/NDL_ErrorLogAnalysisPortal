Traditionally, the data available for traffic simulations come from a population census and dedicated road surveys that only partly cover shopping, leisure, or recreational trips. To account for the latter, the presented traffic modeling framework exploits the digital footprints of city inhabitants on services such as Twitter and Foursquare. We enriched the model with findings from our previous studies on geographical layout of communities in a country-wide mobile phone network to account for socially related journeys. These datasets were used to calibrate a variant of a radiation model of spatial choice, which we introduced in order to drive individualsâ\u20AC™ decisions on trip destinations within an assigned daily activity plan. We observed that given the distribution of population, the workplace locations, a comprehensive set of urban facilities, and a list of typical activity sequences of city dwellers collected within a national travel survey, the developed microsimulation reproduces not only the journey statistics such as peak travel periods but also the traffic volumes at main road segments with surprising accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7557","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7557","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7558","fieldValue":"Hossain, M Shahriar"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7558","fieldValue":"Bozchalui, Mohammad C"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7558","fieldValue":" Ushered by recent developments in various areas of science and technology, modern energy systems are going to be an inevitable part of our societies. Smart grids are one of these modern systems that have attracted many research activities in recent years. Before utilizing the next generation of smart grids, we should have a comprehensive understanding of the interdependent energy networks and processes. Next-generation energy systems networks cannot be effectively designed, analyzed, and controlled in isolation from the social, economic, sensing, and control contexts in which they operate. In this article, we present a novel framework to support charging and storage infrastructure design for electric vehicles. We develop coordinated clustering techniques to work with network models of urban environments to aid in placement of charging stations for an electrical vehicle deployment scenario. Furthermore, we evaluate the network before and after the deployment of charging stations, to recommend the installation of appropriate storage units to overcome the extra load imposed on the network by the charging stations. We demonstrate the multiple factors that can be simultaneously leveraged in our framework to achieve practical urban deployment. Our ultimate goal is to help realize sustainable energy system management in urban electrical infrastructure by modeling and analyzing networks of interactions between electric systems and urban populations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7558","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7558","fieldValue":"ACM"}
