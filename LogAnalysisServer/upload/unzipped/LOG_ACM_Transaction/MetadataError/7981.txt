We propose a resource-constrained asymmetric redundancy elimination algorithm (RCARE) to leverage downlink bandwidth and receiver capability to accelerate the uplink data transfer. RCARE can be deployed on a client or a proxy. Different from existing asymmetric algorithms, RCARE uses a flexible matching mechanism to identify redundant data and allocates a small sender cache to absorb the high downlink traffic overhead. Compared to existing redundancy elimination algorithms, RCARE provides a scalable sender cache that is adaptive based on resource and performance. We evaluate RCARE with real traffic traces collected from multiple servers and a campus gateway. The trace-driven simulation results indicate that RCARE achieves higher goodput gains and reduces downlink traffic compared to existing asymmetric communication algorithms. We design an adaptation algorithm for resource-constrained senders sending multiple data streams. Our algorithm takes samples from data streams and predicts how to invest cache size on individual data streams to achieve maximal uplink goodput gain. The adaptation algorithm improves the goodput gain by up to 87% compared to the baseline. In first 10% of data streams (sorted by the optimal goodput gains), RCARE achieves up to 42% goodput gain on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10781","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10781","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10781","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10782","fieldValue":" Distributed in-network data-centric processing aims to reduce energy consumed for communication and establish a self-contained data storage, retrieval, aggregation, and query sensor system that focuses more on the data itself rather than the identities of the individual network nodes. Double-ruling-based schemes support efficient in-network data-centric information storage and retrieval, especially for aggregated data, since all data with different types generated in a network can be conveniently retrieved along any single retrieval curve. Previous double-ruling-based research focuses on two-dimensional (2-D) wireless sensor networks where a 2-D planar setting is assumed. With increasing interests in deploying wireless sensors in three-dimensional (3-D) space for various applications, it is urgent yet fundamentally challenging to design double-ruling-based approach in general 3-D sensor networks because double-ruling-based schemes in general have much harder geometric constraints than other distributed in-network data-centric processing schemes. In this research, we propose a geographic location-free double-ruling-based approach for general 3-D sensor networks with possibly complicated topology and geometric shapes. Without the knowledge of the geographic location and the distance bound, a query simply travels along a simple curve with the guaranteed success to retrieve aggregated data through time and space with one or different types across the network. Extensive simulations and comparisons show the proposed scheme with low cost and a balanced traffic load."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10782","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10782","fieldValue":"ACM"}
