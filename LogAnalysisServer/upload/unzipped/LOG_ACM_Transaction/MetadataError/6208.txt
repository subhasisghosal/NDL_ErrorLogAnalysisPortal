Using multiple wireless on-body systems, such as physiological data monitoring and motion capture systems, body sensor network data consists of heterogeneous physiologic and motoric streams that form a multidimensional framework. In this article, we analyze such high-dimensional body sensor network data by proposing an efficient, multidimensional factor analysis technique for quantifying human performance and, at the same time, providing visualization for performances of participants in a low-dimensional space for easier interpretation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6554","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6554","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6555","fieldValue":"Spruijt-Metz, Donna"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6555","fieldValue":" The use of biometric sensors for monitoring an individualâ\u20AC™s health and related behaviors, continuously and in real time, promises to revolutionize healthcare in the near future. In an effort to better understand the complex interplay between oneâ\u20AC™s medical condition and social, environmental, and metabolic parameters, this article presents the KNOWME platform, a complete, end-to-end, body area sensing system that integrates off-the-shelf biometric sensors with a Nokia N95 mobile phone to continuously monitor the metabolic signals of a subject. With a current focus on pediatric obesity, KNOWME employs metabolic signals to monitor and evaluate physical activity. KNOWME development and in-lab deployment studies have revealed three major challenges: (1) the need for robustness to highly varying operating environments due to subject-induced variability, such as mobility or sensor placement; (2) balancing the tension between achieving high fidelity data collection and minimizing network energy consumption; and (3) accurate physical activity detection using a modest number of sensors. The KNOWME platform described herein directly addresses these three challenges. Design robustness is achieved by creating a three-tiered sensor data collection architecture. The system architecture is designed to provide robust, continuous, multichannel data collection and scales without compromising normal mobile device operation. Novel physical activity detection methods which exploit new representations of sensor signals provide accurate and efficient physical activity detection. The physical activity detection method employs personalized training phases and accounts for intersession variability. Finally, exploiting the features of the hardware implementation, a low-complexity sensor sampling algorithm is developed, resulting in significant energy savings without loss of performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6555","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6555","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6556","fieldValue":"Gupta, Sandeep K S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6556","fieldValue":" Body area networks (BANs) are networks of medical devices implanted within or worn on the human body. Analysis and verification of BAN designs require (i) early feedback on the BAN design and (ii) high-confidence evaluation of BANs without requiring any hazardous, intrusive, and costly deployment. Any design of BAN further has to ensure (i) the safety of the human body, that is, limiting any undesirable side-effects (e.g., heat dissipation) of BAN operations (involving sensing, computation, and communication among the devices) on the human body, and (ii) the sustainability of the BAN operations, that is, the continuation of the operations under constrained resources (e.g., limited battery power in the devices) without requiring any redeployments. This article uses the Model Based Engineering (MBE) approach to perform design and analysis of BANs. In this regard, first, an abstract cyber-physical model of BANs, called BAN-CPS, is proposed that captures the undesirable side-effects of the medical devices (cyber) on the human body (physical); second, a design and analysis tool, named BAND-AiDe, is developed that allows specification of BAN-CPS using industry standard Abstract Architecture Description Language (AADL) and enables safety and sustainability analysis of BANs; and third, the applicability of BAND-AiDe is shown through a case study using both single and a network of medical devices for health monitoring applications."}
