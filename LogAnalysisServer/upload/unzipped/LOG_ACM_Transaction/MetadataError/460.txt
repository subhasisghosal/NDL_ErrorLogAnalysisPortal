As our main result, we show a new upper bound on the directed planar reachability problem by showing that it can be decided in the class unambiguous logarithmic space (UL). We explore the possibility of showing the same upper bound for the general graph reachability problem. We give a simple reduction showing that the reachability problem for directed graphs with thickness two is complete for the class nondeterministic logarithmic space (NL). Hence an extension of our results to directed graphs with thickness two will unconditionally collapse NL to UL."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12461","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12461","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12462","fieldValue":" We exhibit an explicit function f : {0, $1}^n â\u2020\u2019{0, 1} that can be computed by a nondeterministic number-on-forehead protocol communicating O(logn) bits, but that requires nÎ©(1)$ bits of communication for randomized number-on-forehead protocols with kâ\u20AC\u2030=â\u20AC\u2030Î\u201DÂ·logn players, for any fixed Î\u201Dâ\u20AC\u2030"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12462","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12462","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12463","fieldValue":" A classic result due to HÃ¥stad established that for every constant &epsiv;â\u20AC\u2030>â\u20AC\u20300, given an overdetermined system of linear equations over a finite field $F_q$ where each equation depends on exactly 3 variables and at least a fraction (1â\u20AC\u2030âˆ\u2019â\u20AC\u2030&epsiv;) of the equations can be satisfied, it is NP-hard to satisfy even a fraction (1\/qâ\u20AC\u2030+â\u20AC\u2030&epsiv;) of the equations.
