While deterministic modeling strategies are widely used in computational biology, stochastic modeling techniques are not as popular due to a lack of user-friendly tools. This paper presents ENISI SDE, a novel web-based modeling tool with stochastic differential equations. ENISI SDE provides user-friendly web user interfaces to facilitate adoption by immunologists and computational biologists. This work provides three major contributions: (1) discussion of SDE as a generic approach for stochastic modeling in computational biology; (2) development of ENISI SDE, a web-based user-friendly SDE modeling tool that highly resembles regular ODE-based modeling; (3) applying ENISI SDE modeling tool through a use case for studying stochastic sources of cell heterogeneity in the context of CD4+ T cell differentiation. The CD4+ T cell differential ODE model has been published [8] and can be downloaded from biomodels.net. The case study reproduces a biological phenomenon that is not captured by the previously published ODE model and shows the effectiveness of SDE as a stochastic modeling approach in biology in general and immunology in particular and the power of ENISI SDE."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5159","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5159","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5159","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5160","fieldValue":"Shyu, Chi-Ren"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5160","fieldValue":" Accurate alignment of protein-protein binding sites can aid in protein docking studies and constructing templates for predicting structure of protein complexes, along with in-depth understanding of evolutionary and functional relationships. However, over the past three decades, structural alignment algorithms have focused predominantly on global alignments with little effort on the alignment of local interfaces. In this paper, we introduce the PBSalign (Protein-protein Binding Site alignment) method, which integrates techniques in graph theory, 3D localized shape analysis, geometric scoring, and utilization of physicochemical and geometrical properties. Computational results demonstrate that PBSalign is capable of identifying similar homologous and analogous binding sites accurately and performing alignments with better geometric match measures than existing protein-protein interface comparison tools. The proportion of better alignment quality generated by PBSalign is 46, 56, and 70 percent more than iAlign as judged by the average match index (MI), similarity index (SI), and structural alignment score (SAS), respectively. PBSalign provides the life science community an efficient and accurate solution to binding-site alignment while striking the balance between topological details and computational complexity."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5160","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5160","fieldValue":"ACM"}
