The proposed method, named as Pitch based Formant Estimation (PFE-AFC), has significantly low complexity compared to Prediction Error Method AFC (PEM-AFC). The proposed PFE-AFC consists of a forward and a backward path processing. The forward path processing includes a low complexity pitch based formant estimator for decorrelation filter coefficients update and a pitch based voice activity detector for speech detection, which facilitates the feedback cancellation filter in the backward path to reduce feedback component and maintain speech quality. From system point of view, the PFE-AFC has low complexity overhead since it is easy to share computation resource with other components in the HA system, such as noise reduction and auditory compensation. In addition, the PFE-AFC is suitable for hardware implementation owing to its regular structure. Complexity evaluations show that the PFE-AFC has four orders lower complexity than the PEM-AFC. Simulation results show that the PFE-AFC and the PEM-AFC can achieve similar PESQ (perceptual evaluation speech quality) and ASG (added stable gain). Moreover, the proposed PFE-AFC can outperform the conventional AFC."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3678","fieldValue":"Low complexity formant estimation adaptive feedback cancellation for hearing aids using pitch based processing"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3678","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3678","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3679","fieldValue":"Kronland-Martinet, Richard"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3679","fieldValue":" This paper presents a physically inspired source-filter model for rolling sound synthesis. The model, which is suitable for real-time implementation, is based on qualitative and quantitative observations obtained from a physics-based model described in the literature. In the first part of the paper, the physics-based model is presented, followed by a perceptual experiment, whose aim is to identify the perceptually relevant information characterizing the rolling interaction. On the basis of this experiment, we hypothesize that the particular pattern of the interaction force is responsible for the perception of a rolling object. A complete analysis-synthesis scheme of this interaction force is then provided, along with a description of the calibration of the proposed source-filter sound synthesis process. Finally, a mapping strategy for intuitive control of the proposed synthesis process (i.e. size and velocity of the rolling object and roughness of the surface) is proposed and validated by a listening test."}
