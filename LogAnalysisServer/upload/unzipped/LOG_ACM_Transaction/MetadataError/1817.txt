Such a distribution satisfies the blue noise property, i.e. lack of low frequency noise and structural bias in the Fourier power spectrum. While many techniques are available for sampling the plane, challenges remain for sampling arbitrary surfaces. In this paper, we present new methods for Poisson disk sampling with spectrum analysis on arbitrary manifold surfaces. Our first contribution is a parallel dart throwing algorithm that generates high-quality surface samples at interactive rates. It is flexible and can be extended to adaptive sampling given a user-specified radius field. Our second contribution is a new method for analyzing the spectral quality of surface samples. Using the spectral mesh basis derived from the discrete mesh Laplacian operator, we extend standard concepts in power spectrum analysis such as radial means and anisotropy to arbitrary manifold surfaces. This provides a way to directly evaluate the spectral distribution quality of surface samples without requiring mesh parameterization. Finally, we implement our Poisson disk sampling algorithm on the GPU, and demonstrate practical applications involving interactive sampling and texturing on arbitrary surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16379","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16380","fieldValue":"Wei, Li-Yi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16380","fieldValue":"Fu, Chi-Wing"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16380","fieldValue":" Blue noise sampling is widely employed for a variety of imaging, geometry, and rendering applications. However, existing research so far has focused mainly on isotropic sampling, and challenges remain for the anisotropic scenario both in sample generation and quality verification. We present anisotropic blue noise sampling to address these issues. On the generation side, we extend dart throwing and relaxation, the two classical methods for isotropic blue noise sampling, for the anisotropic setting, while ensuring both high-quality results and efficient computation. On the verification side, although Fourier spectrum analysis has been one of the most powerful and widely adopted tools, so far it has been applied only to uniform isotropic samples. We introduce approaches based on warping and sphere sampling that allow us to extend Fourier spectrum analysis for adaptive and\/or anisotropic samples; thus, we can detect problems in alternative anisotropic sampling techniques that were not yet found via prior verification. We present several applications of our technique, including stippling, visualization, surface texturing, and object distribution."}
