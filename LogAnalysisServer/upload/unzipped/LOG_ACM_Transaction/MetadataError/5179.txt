{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4082","fieldValue":" Previous research on relation classification has verified the effectiveness of using dependency shortest paths or dependency subtrees. How to efficiently unify these two kinds of dependency information in relation classification is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel structure, termed augmented dependency path (ADP), which is composed of the shortest dependency path between two entities and the subtrees attached to the shortest path. To exploit the semantic representation behind the ADP structure, we develop the dependency-based neural networks (DepNN) model which combines the advantages of the recursive neural network (RNN) and the convolutional neural network (CNN). In DepNN, RNN is designed to model the dependency subtrees since it is good at capturing the hierarchical structures. Then, the semantic representation in subtrees is passed to the nodes on the shortest path and CNN is used to get the most important features on the ADP. Experiments on the SemEval-2010 dataset show that the ADP structure including both the shortest dependency path and the attached subtrees is helpful to classify the semantic relations between two entities and our proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4082","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4082","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4082","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4083","fieldValue":" In this contribution, we focus on the problem of power spectral density (PSD) estimation from multiple microphone signals in reverberant and noisy environments. The PSD estimation method proposed in this paper is based on the maximum likelihood (ML) methodology. In particular, we derive a novel ML PSD estimation scheme that is suitable for sound scenes which besides speech and reverberation consists of an additional noise component whose second-order statistics are known. The proposed algorithm is shown to outperform an existing similar algorithm in terms of PSD estimation accuracy. Moreover, it is shown numerically that the mean-squared estimation error achieved by the proposed method is near the limit set by the corresponding Cram√©r--Rao lower bound. The speech dereverberation performance of a multichannel Wiener filter based on the proposed PSD estimators is measured using several instrumental measures and is shown to be higher than when the competing estimator is used. Moreover, we perform a speech intelligibility test where we demonstrate that both the proposed and the competing PSD estimators lead to similar intelligibility improvements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4083","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/4083","fieldValue":"Cram&eacute;r--Rao lower bound"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4084","fieldValue":"Karimian-Azari, Sam"}
