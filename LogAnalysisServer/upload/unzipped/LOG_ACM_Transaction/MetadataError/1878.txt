{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16534","fieldValue":" Fluid animation practitioners face great challenges from the complexity of flow dynamics and the high cost of numerical simulation. A major hindrance is the uncertainty of fluid behavior after simulation resolution increases and extra turbulent effects are added. In this paper, we propose to regulate fluid animations with predesigned flow patterns. Animators can design their desired fluid behavior with fast, low-cost simulations. Flow patterns are then extracted from the results by the Lagrangian Coherent Structure (LCS) that represents major flow skeleton. Therefore, the final high-quality animation is confined towards the designed behavior by applying the patterns to drive high-resolution and turbulent simulations. The pattern regulation is easily computed and achieves controllable variance in the output. The method makes it easy to design special fluid effects, which increases the usability and scalability of various advanced fluid modeling technologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16535","fieldValue":" While often a requirement for geometric models, there has been little research in resolving the interaction of deforming surfaces during real-time modeling sessions. To address this important topic, we introduce an interference algorithm specifically designed for the domain of geometric modeling. This algorithm is general, easily working within existing modeling paradigms to maintain their important properties. Our algorithm is fast, and is able to maintain interactive rates on complex deforming meshes of over 75K faces, while robustly removing intersections. Lastly, our method is controllable, allowing fine-tuning to meet the specific needs of the user. This includes support for minimum separation between surfaces and control over the relative rigidity of interacting objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16536","fieldValue":"Olivierxs, Anne-Hlne"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16536","fieldValue":" The performance of an interactive virtual crowd system for entertainment purposes can be greatly improved by setting a level-of-details (LOD) strategy: in distant areas, collision avoidance can even be stealthy disabled to drastically speed-up simulation and to handle huge crowds. The greatest difficulty is then to select LODs to progressively simplify simulation in an imperceptible but efficient manner. The main objective of this work is to experimentally evaluate spectators' ability to detect the presence of collisions in simulations. Factors related to the conditions of observation and simulation are studied, such as the camera angles, distance to camera, level of interpenetration or crowd density. Our main contribution is to provide a LOD selection function resulting from two perceptual studies allowing crowd system designers to scale a simulation by relaxing the collision avoidance constraint in a least perceptible manner. The relaxation of this constraint is an important source for computational resources savings. Our results reveal several misconceptions in previously used LOD selection functions and suggest yet unexplored variables to be considered. We demonstrate our function efficiency over several evaluation scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16536","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16536","fieldValue":"ACM"}
