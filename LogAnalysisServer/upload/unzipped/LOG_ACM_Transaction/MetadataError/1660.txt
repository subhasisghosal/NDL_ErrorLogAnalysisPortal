{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15983","fieldValue":" During the last decade, motion capture data has emerged and gained a leading role in animations, games and 3D environments. Many of these applications require the creation of expressive overview video clips capturing the human motion, however sufficient attention has not been given to this problem. In this paper, we present a technique that generates an overview video based on the analysis of motion capture data. Our method is targeted for applications of 3D character based animations, automating, for example, the action summary and gameplay overview in simulations and computer games. We base our method on quantum annealing optimization with an objective function that respects the analysis of the character motion and the camera movement constraints. It automatically generates a smooth camera control path, splitting it to several shots if required. To evaluate our method, we introduce a novel camera placement metric which is evaluated against previous work and conduct a user study comparing our results with the various systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15984","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15984","fieldValue":" In this paper, we introduce a novel system for browsing, enhancing, and manipulating casual outdoor photographs by combining them with already existing georeferenced digital terrain and urban models. A simple interactive registration process is used to align a photograph with such a model. Once the photograph and the model have been registered, an abundance of information, such as depth, texture, and GIS data, becomes immediately available to our system. This information, in turn, enables a variety of operations, ranging from dehazing and relighting the photograph, to novel view synthesis, and overlaying with geographic information. We describe the implementation of a number of these applications and discuss possible extensions. Our results show that augmenting photographs with already available 3D models of the world supports a wide variety of new ways for us to experience and interact with our everyday snapshots."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15984","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15984","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15985","fieldValue":"Wong, Tien-Tsin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15985","fieldValue":"Leung, Chi-Sing"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15985","fieldValue":" Even though the temporal information is lost, a still picture of moving animals hints at their motion. In this paper, we infer motion cycle of animals from the \"motion snapshots\" (snapshots of different individuals) captured in a still picture. By finding the motion path in the graph connecting motion snapshots, we can infer the order of motion snapshots with respect to time, and hence the motion cycle. Both \"half-cycle\" and \"full-cycle\" motions can be inferred in a unified manner. Therefore, we can animate a still picture of a moving animal group by morphing among the ordered snapshots. By refining the pose, morphology, and appearance consistencies, smooth and realistic animal motion can be synthesized. Our results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to a wide range of species, including birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles."}
