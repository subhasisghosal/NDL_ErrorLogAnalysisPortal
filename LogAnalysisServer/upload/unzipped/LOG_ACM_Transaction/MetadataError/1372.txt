By using animation as the source, we can produce new animations that are expressive, exaggerated or non-realistic.Cartoon capture transforms a digitized cartoon into a cartoon motion representation. Using a combination of affine transformation and key-shape interpolation, cartoon capture tracks non-rigid shape changes in cartoon layers. Cartoon retargeting translates this information into different output media. The result is an animation with a new look but with the movement of the original cartoon."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15234","fieldValue":" In this paper we present a general method for rapid prototyping of realistic character motion. We solve for the natural motion from a simple animation provided by the animator. Our framework can be used to produce relatively complex realistic motion with little user effort.We describe a novel constraint detection method that automatically determines different constraints on the character by analyzing the input motion. We show that realistic motion can be achieved by enforcing a small set of linear and angular momentum constraints. This simplified approach helps us avoid the complexities of computing muscle forces. Simpler dynamic constraints also allow us to generate animations of models with greater complexity, performing more intricate motions. Finally, we show that by learning a small set of key parameters that describe a character pose we can help a non-skilled animator rapidly create realistic character motion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15234","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15234","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15235","fieldValue":" The ability to learn is a potentially compelling and important quality for interactive synthetic characters. To that end, we describe a practical approach to real-time learning for synthetic characters. Our implementation is grounded in the techniques of reinforcement learning and informed by insights from animal training. It simplifies the learning task for characters by (a) enabling them to take advantage of predictable regularities in their world, (b) allowing them to make maximal use of any supervisory signals, and (c) making them easy to train by humans.We built an autonomous animated dog that can be trained with a technique used to train real dogs called \"clicker training\". Capabilities demonstrated include being trained to recognize and use acoustic patterns as cues for actions, as well as to synthesize new actions from novel paths through its motion space.A key contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that by addressing the three problems of state, action, and state-action space discovery at the same time, the solution for each becomes easier. Finally, we articulate heuristics and design principles that make learning practical for synthetic characters."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15235","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15235","fieldValue":"ACM"}
