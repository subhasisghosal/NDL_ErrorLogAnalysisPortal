In this work, we have studied several feature extraction approaches for representing proteins and propose a novel bacterial virulent protein prediction method, based on an ensemble of classifiers where the features are extracted directly from the amino acid sequence and from the evolutionary information of a given protein. We have evaluated and compared several ensembles obtained by combining six feature extraction methods and several classification approaches based on two general purpose classifiers (i.e., Support Vector Machine and a variant of input decimated ensemble) and their random subspace version. An extensive evaluation was performed according to a blind testing protocol, where the parameters of the system are optimized using the training set and the system is validated in three different independent data sets, allowing selection of the most performing system and demonstrating the validity of the proposed method. Based on the results obtained using the blind test protocol, it is interesting to note that even if in each independent data set the most performing stand-alone method is not always the same, the fusion of different methods enhances prediction efficiency in all the tested independent data sets."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4732","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4732","fieldValue":"Identifying Bacterial Virulent Proteins by Fusing a Set of Classifiers Based on Variants of Chou's Pseudo Amino Acid Composition and on Evolutionary Information"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4733","fieldValue":"Cheng, Yi-Ming"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4733","fieldValue":" Molecular dynamics trajectories are very data intensive thereby limiting sharing and archival of such data. One possible solution is compression of trajectory data. Here, trajectory compression based on conversion to the coarse-grained model PRIMO is proposed. The compressed data are about one third of the original data and fast decompression is possible with an analytical reconstruction procedure from PRIMO to all-atom representations. This protocol largely preserves structural features and to a more limited extent also energetic features of the original trajectory."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4733","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4733","fieldValue":"Proteins, all-atom reconstruction, PRIMO, molecular dynamics simulation, compression, coarse-grained model."}
