In this paper, we propose Securitas, a network trace-based protocol identification system, which exploits the semantic information in protocol message formats. Securitas requires no prior knowledge of protocol specifications. Deeming a protocol as a language between two processes, our approach is based upon the new insight that the n-grams of protocol traces, just like those of natural languages, exhibit highly skewed frequency-rank distribution that can be leveraged in the context of protocol identification. In Securitas, we first extract the statistical protocol message formats by clustering n-grams with the same semantics, and then use the corresponding statistical formats to classify raw network traces. Our tool involves the following key features: 1) applicable to both connection oriented protocols and connection less protocols; 2) suitable for both text and binary protocols; 3) no need to assemble IP packets into TCP or UDP flows; and 4) effective for both long-live flows and short-live flows. We implement Securitas and conduct extensive evaluations on real-world network traces containing both textual and binary protocols. Our experimental results on BitTorrent, CIFS\/SMB, DNS, FTP, PPLIVE, SIP, and SMTP traces show that Securitas has the ability to accurately identify the network traces of the target application protocol with an average recall of about 97.4% and an average precision of about 98.4%. Our experimental results prove Securitas is a robust system, and meanwhile displaying a competitive performance in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10890","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10890","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10890","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10891","fieldValue":" Multipath TCP (MP-TCP) has the potential to greatly improve application performance by using multiple paths transparently. We propose a fluid model for a large class of MP-TCP algorithms and identify design criteria that guarantee the existence, uniqueness, and stability of system equilibrium. We clarify how algorithm parameters impact TCP-friendliness, responsiveness, and window oscillation and demonstrate an inevitable tradeoff among these properties. We discuss the implications of these properties on the behavior of existing algorithms and motivate our algorithm Balia (balanced linked adaptation), which generalizes existing algorithms and strikes a good balance among TCP-friendliness, responsiveness, and window oscillation. We have implemented Balia in the Linux kernel. We use our prototype to compare the new algorithm to existing MP-TCP algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10891","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10891","fieldValue":"TCPIP"}
