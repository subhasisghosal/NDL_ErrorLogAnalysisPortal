In particular, we focus on two different scenarios: the constant energy harvesting (EH) rate model where the EH rate remains constant within the time of interest and the i.i.d. EH rate model where the EH rates are independent and identically distributed across different contention slots. To quantify the roles of both the energy state information (ESI) and the channel state information (CSI), a distributed opportunistic scheduling (DOS) framework with two-stage probing and save-then-transmit energy utilization is proposed. Then, the optimal throughput and the optimal scheduling strategy are obtained via one-dimension search, i.e., an iterative algorithm consisting of the following two steps in each iteration: First, assuming that the stored energy level at each transmitter is stationary with a given distribution, the expected throughput maximization problem is formulated as an optimal stopping problem, whose solution is proven to exist and then derived for both models; second, for a fixed stopping rule, the energy level at each transmitter is shown to be stationary and an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to compute its steady-state distribution. Finally, we validate our analysis by numerical results and quantify the throughput gain compared with the best-effort delivery scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10917","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10917","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10917","fieldValue":"Distributed opportunistic scheduling for energy harvesting based wireless networks: a two-stage probing approach"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10917","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10917","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10918","fieldValue":" In rechargeable sensor networks (RSNs), energy harvested by sensors should be carefully allocated for data sensing and data transmission to optimize data gathering due to time-varying renewable energy arrival and limited battery capacity. Moreover, the dynamic feature of network topology should be taken into account, since it can affect the data transmission. In this paper, we strive to optimize data gathering in terms of network utility by jointly considering data sensing and data transmission. To this end, we design a data gathering optimization algorithm for dynamic sensing and routing (DoSR), which consists of two parts. In the first part, we design a balanced energy allocation scheme (BEAS) for each sensor to manage its energy use, which is proven to meet four requirements raised by practical scenarios. Then in the second part, we propose a distributed sensing rate and routing control (DSR2C) algorithm to jointly optimize data sensing and data transmission, while guaranteeing network fairness. In DSR2C, each sensor can adaptively adjust its transmit energy consumption during network operation according to the amount of available energy, and select the optimal sensing rate and routing, which can efficiently improve data gathering. Furthermore, since recomputing the optimal data sensing and routing strategies upon change of energy allocation will bring huge communications for information exchange and computation, we propose an improved BEAS to manage the energy allocation in the dynamic environments and a topology control scheme to reduce computational complexity. Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in comparison with existing algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10918","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
