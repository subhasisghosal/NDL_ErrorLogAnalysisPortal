When looking for a new place to live, we want to see how the interior looks not with the current inhabitant's belongings, but with our own furniture. Before purchasing a new sofa, we want to visualize how it would look in our living room. In this paper, we present a system that takes an RGBD scan of an indoor scene and produces a scene model of the empty room, including light emitters, materials, and the geometry of the non-cluttered room. Our system enables realistic rendering not only of the empty room under the original lighting conditions, but also with various scene edits, including adding furniture, changing the material properties of the walls, and relighting. These types of scene edits enable many mixed reality applications in areas such as real estate, furniture retail, and interior design. Our system contains two novel technical contributions: a 3D radiometric calibration process that recovers the appearance of the scene in high dynamic range, and a global-illumination-aware inverse rendering framework that simultaneously recovers reflectance properties of scene surfaces and lighting properties for several light source types, including generalized point and line lights."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17672","fieldValue":"Shih, Kuang-Tsu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17672","fieldValue":"Liu, Jen-Shuo"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17672","fieldValue":"Yeh, Su-Ling"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17672","fieldValue":" Recent study in vision science has shown that blue light in a certain frequency band affects human circadian rhythm and impairs our health. Although applying a light blocker to an image display can block the harmful blue light, it inevitably makes an image look like an aged photo. In this paper, we show that it is possible to reduce harmful blue light while preserving the blue appearance of an image. Moreover, we optimize the spectral transmittance profile of blue light blocker based on psychophysical data and develop a color compensation algorithm to minimize color distortion. A prototype using notch filters is built as a proof of concept."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17672","fieldValue":"ACM"}
