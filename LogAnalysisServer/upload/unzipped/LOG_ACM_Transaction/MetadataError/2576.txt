The software implements a family of spacial discretization formulas, based on piecewise Chebyshev polynomial expansions with C0 continuity. The package has been designed to be used in conjunction with a general integrator for initial value problems to provide a powerful software tool for the solution of parabolic-elliptic PDEs with coupled differential algebraic equations. Examples are provided to illustrate the use of the package with the DASSL d.a.e integrator of Petzold [18]."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18679","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18679","fieldValue":"ACM"}
