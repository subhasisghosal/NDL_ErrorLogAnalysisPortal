Such exploratory settings provide for a rich educational environment for students, but they challenge teachers to keep track of studentsâ\u20AC™ progress and to assess their performance. This article presents techniques for recognizing studentsâ\u20AC™ activities in such pedagogical software and visualizing these activities to teachers. It describes a new plan recognition algorithm that uses a recursive grammar that takes into account repetition and interleaving of activities. This algorithm was evaluated empirically using an exploratory environment for teaching chemistry used by thousands of students in several countries. It was always able to correctly infer studentsâ\u20AC™ plans when the appropriate grammar was available. We designed two methods for visualizing studentsâ\u20AC™ activities for teachers: one that visualizes studentsâ\u20AC™ inferred plans, and one that visualizes studentsâ\u20AC™ interactions over a timeline. Both of these visualization methods were preferred to and found more helpful than a baseline method which showed a movie of studentsâ\u20AC™ interactions. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining novel AI techniques and visualization methods for the purpose of designing collaborative systems that support students in their problem solving and teachers in their understanding of studentsâ\u20AC™ performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7173","fieldValue":"de Gemmis, Marco"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7173","fieldValue":" Recommender systems have already proved to be valuable for coping with the information overload problem in several application domains. They provide people with suggestions for items which are likely to be of interest for them; hence, a primary function of recommender systems is to help people make good choices and decisions. However, most previous research has focused on recommendation techniques and algorithms, and less attention has been devoted to the decision making processes adopted by the users and possibly supported by the system. There is still a gap between the importance that the community gives to the assessment of recommendation algorithms and the current range of ongoing research activities concerning human decision making. Different decision-psychological phenomena can influence the decision making of users of recommender systems, and research along these lines is becoming increasingly important and popular. This special issue highlights how the coupling of recommendation algorithms with the understanding of human choice and decision making theory has the potential to benefit research and practice on recommender systems and to enable users to achieve a good balance between decision accuracy and decision effort."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7174","fieldValue":"Guerin, Joshua T"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7174","fieldValue":" A Markov Decision Process (MDP) policy presents, for each state, an action, which preferably maximizes the expected utility accrual over time. In this article, we present a novel explanation system for MDP policies. The system interactively generates conversational English-language explanations of the actions suggested by an optimal policy, and does so in real time. We rely on natural language explanations in order to build trust between the user and the explanation system, leveraging existing research in psychology in order to generate salient explanations. Our explanation system is designed for portability between domains and uses a combination of domain-specific and domain-independent techniques. The system automatically extracts implicit knowledge from an MDP model and accompanying policy. This MDP-based explanation system can be ported between applications without additional effort by knowledge engineers or model builders. Our system separates domain-specific data from the explanation logic, allowing for a robust system capable of incremental upgrades. Domain-specific explanations are generated through case-based explanation techniques specific to the domain and a knowledge base of concept mappings used to generate English-language explanations."}
