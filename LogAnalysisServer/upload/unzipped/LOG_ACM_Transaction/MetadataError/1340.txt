To this end; we present algorithms for discovering periodic trends in the combinatorial property testing model in a data stream S of length n using o(n) samples and space. In accordance with the property testing model, we first explore the notion of being â\u20ACœcloseâ\u20AC? to periodic by defining three different notions of self-distance through relaxing different notions of exact periodicity. An input S is then called approximately periodic if it exhibits a small self-distance (with respect to any one self-distance defined). We show that even though the different definitions of exact periodicity are equivalent, the resulting definitions of self-distance and approximate periodicity are not; we also show that these self-distances are constant approximations of each other. Afterwards, we present algorithms which distinguish between the two cases where S is exactly periodic and S is far from periodic with only a constant probability of error. Our algorithms sample only $O(&sqrt;nlog^2 n) (or O(&sqrt;nlog4 n), depending on the self-distance) positions and use as much space. They can also find, using o(n) samples and space, the largest\/smallest period, and\/or all of the approximate periods of S. These algorithms can also be viewed as working on streaming inputs where each data item is seen once and in order, storing only a sublinear (O(&sqrt;nlog2 n) or O(&sqrt;nlog4$ n)) size sample from which periodicities are identified."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15152","fieldValue":" This article presents a new lossless compression algorithm for computer animation image sequences. The algorithm uses transformation information available in the animation script and floating point depth and object number information at each pixel to perform highly accurate motion prediction with vary low computation. The geometric data (i.e., the depth and object number) can either be computed during the original rendering process and stored with the image or computed on the fly during compression and decompression. In the former case the stored geometric data are very efficientlycomporessed using motion prediction and a new technique called direction coding, typically to 1 to 2 bits per pixel. The geometric data are also useful in z-buffer image compsiting and this new compression algorthm offers a very low storage overhead method for saving the information needed for this comoositing. The overall compression ratio of the new algorithm, including the geometic data overhead, in compared to conventional spatial linear prediction compression and block-matching motion. The algorithm improves on a previous motion prediction algorithm by incorporating block predictor switching and color ratio predition. The combination of thes techniques gives compression ratios 30% better than those reported previously."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15152","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15152","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15153","fieldValue":"van Overveld, C W A M"}
