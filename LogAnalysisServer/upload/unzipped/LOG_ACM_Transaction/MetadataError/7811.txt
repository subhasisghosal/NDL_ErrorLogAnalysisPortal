This problem has numerous applications including: 1) mobile devices connecting to multiple licensed and ISM bands, and 2) cognitive multiradio devices employing spectrum bonding. In this paper, we ascertain how to optimally determine which video packets to transmit over each access network. We present models to capture the network conditions and video characteristics and develop an integer program for deterministic packet scheduling. Solving the integer program exactly is typically not computationally tractable, so we develop heuristic algorithms for deterministic packet scheduling, as well as convex optimization problems for randomized packet scheduling. We carry out a thorough study of the tradeoff between performance and computational complexity and propose a convex programming-based algorithm that yields good performance while being suitable for real-time applications. We conduct extensive trace-driven simulations to evaluate the proposed algorithms using real network conditions and scalable video streams. The simulation results show that the proposed convex programming-based algorithm: 1) outperforms the rate control algorithms defined in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) by about 10-15 dB higher video quality; 2) reduces average delivery delay by over 90% compared to DCCP; 3) results in higher average video quality of 4.47 and 1.92 dB than the two developed heuristics; 4) runs efficiently, up to six times faster than the best-performing heuristic; and 5) does indeed provide service differentiation among users."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10437","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10438","fieldValue":"De Pellegrini, Francesco"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10438","fieldValue":" Performance of a delay-tolerant network has strong dependence on the nodes participating in data transportation. Such networks often face several resource constraints especially related to energy. Energy is consumed not only in data transmission, but also in listening and in several signaling activities. On one hand these activities enhance the system's performance while on the other hand, they consume a significant amount of energy even when they do not involve actual node transmission. Accordingly, in order to use energy efficiently, one may have to limit not only the amount of transmissions, but also the amount of nodes that are active at each time. Therefore, we study two coupled problems: 1) the activation problem that determines when a mobile will turn on in order to receive packets; and 2) the problem of regulating the beaconing. We derive optimal energy management strategies by formulating the problem as an optimal control one, which we then explicitly solve. We also validate our findings through extensive simulations that are based on contact traces."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10438","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10438","fieldValue":"ACM"}
