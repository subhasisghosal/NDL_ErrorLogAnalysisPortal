However, not all combinations work well for all systems, so making the right choices is essential for obtaining an efficient solver. The numerical results for 256 matrices presented in this article give an indication of which approaches are suitable for which matrices (based on different criteria, such as total computation time or fill-in) and of the differences between the methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19235","fieldValue":"A numerical evaluation of preprocessing and ILU-type preconditioners for the solution of unsymmetric sparse linear systems using iterative methods"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19235","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19235","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19236","fieldValue":"Lourakis, Manolis I A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19236","fieldValue":" Bundle adjustment constitutes a large, nonlinear least-squares problem that is often solved as the last step of feature-based structure and motion estimation computer vision algorithms to obtain optimal estimates. Due to the very large number of parameters involved, a general purpose least-squares algorithm incurs high computational and memory storage costs when applied to bundle adjustment. Fortunately, the lack of interaction among certain subgroups of parameters results in the corresponding Jacobian being sparse, a fact that can be exploited to achieve considerable computational savings. This article presents sba, a publicly available C\/C++ software package for realizing generic bundle adjustment with high efficiency and flexibility regarding parameterization."}
