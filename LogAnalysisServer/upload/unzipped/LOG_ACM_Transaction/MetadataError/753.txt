Our methodology improves area penalty, which is a large issue for logic repair technology in actual products, by using repair grouping and a redundant cell insertion algorithm and by pushing the design rule for the repairable area of R-SFF. Additionally, compared with the conventional method, we reduce the number of wire connections around redundant cells by improving the replacement method of the faulty cell by the redundant cell. The proposed methodology reduces the total area penalty caused by the logic redundant repair to 3.6&percnt; and improves the yield, that is the number of good chips on a wafer, by 4.7&percnt; when the defect density is 1.0[1\/cm^2]. Furthermore, we propose the strategy to repair the in-field failures due to latent defect for the chip whose repair function had not been used in the shipment test."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13260","fieldValue":"OPC"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13260","fieldValue":"A Yield and Reliability Improvement Methodology Based on Logic Redundant Repair with a Repairable Scan Flip-Flop Designed by Push Rule"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13260","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13260","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13261","fieldValue":"Wang, Laung-Terng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13261","fieldValue":" Test data compression is a much more difficult problem for launch-on-capture (LOC) delay testing, because test data for LOC delay testing is much more than that of stuck-at fault testing, and LOC delay fault test generation in the two-frame circuit model can specify many more inputs. A new scan architecture is proposed to compress test stimulus data, compact test responses, and reduce test application time for LOC delay fault testing. The new scan architecture merges a number of scan flip-flops into the same group, where all scan flip-flops in the same group are assigned the same values for all test pairs. Sufficient conditions are presented for including any pair of scan flip-flops into the same group for LOC transition, non-robust path delay, and robust path delay fault testing. Test data for LOC delay testing based on the new scan architecture can be compressed significantly. Test application time can also be reduced greatly. Sufficient conditions are presented to construct a test response compactor for LOC transition, non-robust, and robust path delay fault testing. Folded scan forest and test response compactor are constructed for further test data compression. Sufficient experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the method."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13261","fieldValue":"Scan Flip-Flop Grouping to Compress Test Data and Compact Test Responses for Launch-on-Capture Delay Testing"}
