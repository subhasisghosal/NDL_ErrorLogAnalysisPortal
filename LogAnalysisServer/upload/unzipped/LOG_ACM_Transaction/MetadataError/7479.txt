{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1884","fieldValue":" This article describes and evaluates a new approach to optimizing DRAM performance and energy consumption that is based on eagerly writing dirty cache lines to DRAM. Under this approach, many dirty cache lines are written to DRAM before they are evicted. In particular, dirty cache lines that have not been recently accessed are eagerly written to DRAM when the corresponding row has been activated by an ordinary, noneager access, such as a read. This approach enables clustering of reads and writes that target the same row, resulting in a significant reduction in row activations. Specifically, for a variety of applications, it reduces the number of DRAM row activations by an average of 42&percnt; and a maximum of 82&percnt;. Moreover, the results from a full-system simulator show compelling performance improvements and energy consumption reductions. Out of 23 applications, 6 have overall performance improvements between 10&percnt; and 20&percnt;, and 3 have improvements in excess of 20&percnt;. Furthermore, 12 consume between 10&percnt; and 20&percnt; less DRAM energy, and 7 have energy consumption reductions in excess of 20&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1884","fieldValue":"DRAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1884","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1884","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9767","fieldValue":"Yum, Tak-Shing Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9767","fieldValue":" An optimal routing and data aggregation scheme for wireless sensor networks is proposed in this paper. The objective is to maximize the network lifetime by jointly optimizing data aggregation and routing. We adopt a model to integrate data aggregation with the underlying routing scheme and present a smoothing approximation function for the optimization problem. The necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving the optimality are derived and a distributed gradient algorithm is designed accordingly. We show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the data traffic and improve the network lifetime. The distributed algorithm can converge to the optimal value efficiently under all network configurations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9767","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9767","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9767","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9768","fieldValue":" This paper exploits the tradeoff between data quality and energy consumption to extend the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. To obtain an aggregate form of sensor data with precision guarantees, the precision constraint is partitioned and allocated to individual sensor nodes in a coordinated fashion. Our key idea is to differentiate the precisions of data collected from different sensor nodes to balance their energy consumption. Three factors affecting the lifetime of sensor nodes are identified: 1) the changing pattern of sensor readings; 2) the residual energy of sensor nodes; and 3) the communication cost between the sensor nodes and the base station. We analyze the optimal precision allocation in terms of network lifetime and propose an adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts the precision constraints at the sensor nodes. The adaptive scheme also takes into consideration the topological relations among sensor nodes and the effect of in-network aggregation. Experimental results using real data traces show that the proposed scheme significantly improves network lifetime compared to existing methods."}
