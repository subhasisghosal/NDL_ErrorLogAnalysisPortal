Even failures of few nodes or links may have a profound impact on large parts of the system. Traditionally, network vulnerability assessment methods separate the studies of node vulnerability and link vulnerability, and thus ignore joint node and link attack schemes that may cause grave damage to the network. To this end, we introduce a new assessment method, called β-disruptor, that unifies both link and node vulnerability assessment. The new assessment method is formulated as an optimization problem in which we aim to identify a minimum-cost set of mixed links and nodes whose removal would severely disrupt the network connectivity. We prove the NP-completeness of the problem and propose an O(√log n) bicriteria approximation algorithm for the β-disruptor problem. This new theoretical guarantee improves the best approximation results for both link and node vulnerability assessment in literature. We further enhance the proposed algorithm by embedding it into a special combination of simulated annealing and variable neighborhood search method. The results of our extensive simulation-based experiments on synthetic and real networks show the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed vulnerability assessment methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10771","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10771","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10771","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10772","fieldValue":" Network virtualization is a promising new resource management approach that allows customized virtual networks (VNs) to be multiplexed on a shared physical infrastructure. In this paper, our focus is on the embedding of VN resources onto this infrastructure. Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, embedding proposals in literature are heuristic-based approaches that restrict the problem space in different dimensions. Limitations of these proposals are: 1) as embedding of VN links and nodes is performed in two separate stages, it may ensue in a high blocking of VN requests and a less efficient usage of substrate resources; and 2) as pricing of embedding resources is based on linear functions, it triggers no competition among VN users in order to maximize infrastructure provider profits. These drawbacks motivate us to propose a mathematical model that makes use of large-scale optimization tools and proposes a Column Generation (CG) formulation of the problem, coupled with branch-and-bound technique or rounding-off heuristic. We also propose a periodical planning of embedding process where profitable VN requests are selected through an auction mechanism. In our experiments with different substrate network topologies and many different VN request patterns, we show a clear advantage of auction-based CG models over present benchmarks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10772","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10772","fieldValue":"ACM"}
