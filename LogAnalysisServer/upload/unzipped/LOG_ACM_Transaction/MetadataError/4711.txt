{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25163","fieldValue":" Discrete event models are widely used to replicate, analyze, and understand complex systems. DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) formalism enables hierarchical modeling, so it provides an efficiency in the model development of complex models. However, the hierarchical modeling incurs prolonged simulation executions due to indirect event exchanges through the model hierarchy. Although direct event paths are applied to mitigate this overhead, the situation becomes even worse when a model changes its structures during simulation execution, called a dynamic structure model. This article suggests Coupling Relation Graph (CRG) and Strongly Coupled Component (SCC) concepts to improve hierarchical and dynamic structure DEVS simulation execution. CRG is a directed graph representing DEVS model structure, and SCC is a group of connected components in a CRG. Using CRG and SCC, this article presents (1) how to develop CRG from a DEVS model and (2) how to construct and update direct event paths with respect to dynamic structural changes. In particular, compared to the previous works, the proposed method focuses on the reduction of the updating costs for the direct event paths. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, this article shows that the proposed method significantly reduces the simulation execution time, especially when a simulation model contains lots of components and changes its model structures frequently. We expect that the proposed method would support the faster simulation executions of complex hierarchical and dynamic structure models."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25163","fieldValue":"DEVS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25163","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25163","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25164","fieldValue":" Spatially distributed collective adaptive systems are an important class of systems that pose significant challenges to modeling due to the size and complexity of their state spaces. This problem is acute when the dynamic behavior of the system must be captured, such as to predict system performance. In this article, we present an abstraction technique that automatically derives a moment-closure approximation of the dynamic behavior of a spatially distributed collective adaptive system from a discrete representation of the entities involved. The moment-closure technique is demonstrated to give accurate estimates of dynamic behavior, although the number of ordinary differential equations generated for the second-order joint moments can grow large in some cases. For these cases, we propose a rigorous model reduction technique and demonstrate its use to substantially reduce the computational effort with only limited impact on the accuracy if the reduction threshold is set appropriately.
