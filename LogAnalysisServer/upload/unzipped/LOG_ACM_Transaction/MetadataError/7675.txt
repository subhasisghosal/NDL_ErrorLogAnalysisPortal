These features include heavy-tail flight and pause-time distributions and the super-diffusive nature of mobility. Human walks are not random walks, but it is surprising that the patterns of human walks and Levy walks contain some statistical similarity. Our study is based on 226 daily GPS traces collected from 101 volunteers in five different outdoor sites. The heavy-tail flight distribution of human mobility induces the super-diffusivity of travel, but up to 30 min to 1 h due to the boundary effect of people's daily movement, which is caused by the tendency of people to move within a predefined (also confined) area of daily activities. These tendencies are not captured in common mobility models such as random way point (RWP). To evaluate the impact of these tendencies on the performance of mobile networks, we construct a simple truncated Levy walk mobility (TLW) model that emulates the statistical features observed in our analysis and under which we measure the performance of routing protocols in delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The results indicate the following. Higher diffusivity induces shorter intercontact times in DTN and shorter path durations with higher success probability in MANET. The diffusivity of TLW is in between those of RWP and Brownian motion (BM). Therefore, the routing performance under RWP as commonly used in mobile network studies and tends to be overestimated for DTNs and underestimated for MANETs compared to the performance under TLW."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10161","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10161","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10161","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10162","fieldValue":"El Rouayheb, Salim"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10162","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of establishing reliable unicast connections across a communication network with nonuniform edge capacities. Our goal is to provide instantaneous recovery from single edge failures. With instantaneous recovery, the destination node can decode the packets sent by the source node even if one of the network edges fails, without the need of retransmission or rerouting. It has been recognized that the network coding technique offers significant advantages for this problem over standard solutions such as disjoint path routing and diversity coding. We focus on two cases of practical interest: 1) backup protection of a single flow that can be split into two subflows; and 2) shared backup protection of two unicast flows. We present an efficient network coding algorithm that operates over a small finite field (GF(2)). The small size of the underlying field results in a significant reduction in the computational and communication overhead associated with the practical implementation of the network coding technique. Our algorithm exploits the unique structure of minimum coding networks, i.e., networks that do not contain redundant edges. We also consider the related capacity reservation problem and present an approximation algorithm that finds a solution whose cost is at most two times more than the optimum."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10162","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
