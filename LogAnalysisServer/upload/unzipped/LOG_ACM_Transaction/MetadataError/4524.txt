A shortcoming of this world view is identified with respect to modularity and encapsulation. A modification of the world view that supports modularity and encapsulation is presented, and its advantages are discussed. It is shown how some recent process-oriented simulation languages support this modified world view. The impact of this modification on parallel simulation is discussed, and the modified world view is briefly compared to the use of object-oriented simulation modeling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24694","fieldValue":" Let X = {X(t)}t â\u2030¥ 0 be a stochastic process with a stationary version X*. It is investigated when it is possible to generate by simulation a version XËœ of X with lower initial bias than X itself, in the sense that either XËœ is strictly stationary (has the same distribution as X*) or the distribution of XËœ is close to the distribution of X*. Particular attention is given to regenerative processes and Markov processes with a finite, countable, or general state space. The results are both positive and negative, and indicate that the tail of the distribution of the cycle length Ï\u201E plays a critical role. The negative results essentially state that without some information on this tail, no a priori computable bias reduction is possible; in particular, this is the case for the class of all Markov processes with a countably infinite state space. On the contrary, the positive results give algorithms for simulating XËœ for various classes of processes with some special structure on Ï\u201E. In particular, one can generate XËœ as strictly stationary for finite state Markov chains, Markov chains satisfying a Doeblin-type minorization, and regenerative processes with the cycle length Ï\u201E bounded or having a stationary age distribution that can be generated by simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24695","fieldValue":" In this paper we consider time scale decomposition as well as spatial decomposition to induce massive parallelism and reduce overhead in distributed discrete-event simulations. We confine our study to the Time Warp strategy and to systems where the durations of activities differ by several orders of magnitude (i.e., systems with fast and slow activities). We show that, for such systems, a large overhead due to rollbacks is encountered when spatial decomposition is used. Moreover, performance degrades as the difference increases between the rates of fast and slow events.Several initial experiments using queueing-network models were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of time scale decomposition in increasing the parallelism and reducing the overhead. These experiments were conducted on a distributed simulation testbed that was implemented on an 18-processor Multimax 320. The application of the above simulation techniques to stochastic Petri net models is illustrated using an example of performability analysis of a fault-tolerant distributed system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24695","fieldValue":"ACM"}
