Due to these properties, shapers also play an increasingly important role in the design of multiprocessor embedded systems that exhibit a considerable amount of on-chip traffic. Despite the growing importance of traffic shapping in this area, no methods exist for analyzing shapers in distributed embedded systems and for incorporating them into a system-level performance analysis. Until now it was not possible to determine the effect of shapers on end-to-end delay guarantees or buffer requirements in such systems. In this work, we present a method for analyzing greedy shapers, and we embed this analysis method into a well-established modular performance analysis framework for real-time embedded systems. The presented approach enables system-level performance analysis of complete systems with greedy shapers, and we prove its applicability by analyzing three case study systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6509","fieldValue":" This article introduces a novel approach to energy-efficient media stream decoding that is based on the notion of media stream similarity. The key idea is that platform-independent scenarios with similar decoding complexity can be identified within and across media streams. A device that decodes a media stream annotated with scenario information can then adjust its processor clock frequency and voltage level based on these scenarios for lower energy consumption. Our evaluation, done using the H.264 AVC decoder and 12 reference video streams, shows an average energy reduction of 44&percnt; while missing less than 0.2&percnt; of the frame deadlines using scenario-driven video decoding. An additional application of scenario-based media stream annotation is to predict required resources (compute power and energy) for consuming a given service on a given device. Resource prediction is extremely useful in a client-server setup in which the client requests a media service from the server or content provider. The content provider (in cooperation with the client) can then determine what service quality to deliver, given the client's available resources. Scenario-aware resource prediction can predict (compute power and energy) consumption with errors less than 4&percnt; (and an overall average 1.4&percnt; error)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1598","fieldValue":" \"Cache decay\" is a set of leakage-reduction mechanisms that put cache lines that have not been accessed for a specific duration into a low-leakage standby mode. This duration is called the decay interval, and its optimal value varies across applications. This paper describes an adaptation technique that analytically finds the optimal decay interval through profiling, and shows that the most important variables required for finding the optimal decay interval can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy using profiling. This work explicitly trades off the leakage power saved in putting both the \"live\" and \"dead\" lines into standby mode, against its performance and energy costs. It achieves energy savings close to what can be obtained with an omniscient choice of per-benchmark optimal decay interval."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1598","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1598","fieldValue":"ACM"}
