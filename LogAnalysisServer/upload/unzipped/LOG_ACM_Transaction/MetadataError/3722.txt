Given street maps of the same city collected from different sources, researchers often need to know how and where they differ. However, the majority of current graph comparison algorithms are based on structural properties of graphs, such as their degree distribution or their local connectivity properties, and do not consider their spatial embedding. This ignores a key property of road networks since the similarity of travel over two road networks is intimately tied to the specific spatial embedding. Likewise, many current algorithms specific to street map comparison either do not provide quality guarantees or focus on spatial embeddings only. Motivated by road network comparison, we propose a new path-based distance measure between two planar geometric graphs that is based on comparing sets of travel paths generated over the graphs. Surprisingly, we are able to show that using paths of bounded link-length, we can capture global structural and spatial differences between the graphs. We show how to utilize our distance measure as a local signature in order to identify and visualize portions of high similarity in the maps. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of our distance measure and its local signature on street map data from Berlin, Germany and Athens, Greece."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21972","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21972","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21973","fieldValue":" Moving regions are a form of spatiotemporal data in which a region changes in shape and\/or position over time. In many fields, moving regions representing real-world phenomena are collected using sensors that take temporally encoded snapshots of regions. We provide a novel algorithm that creates a moving region between any two complex regions. The proposed algorithm has worst-case time bounds of $O;(n;^2$), but can use approximation techniques to achieve O(nlgn) in practice, space bounds of O;(n;), and output size bounded by O;(n;) (where n; is the number of line segments that define the boundaries of the regions)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21973","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21973","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3100","fieldValue":"Tsai, Richard Tzong-Han"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3100","fieldValue":" Parenthetical translations are translations of terms in otherwise monolingual text that appear inside parentheses. Parenthetical translations extraction (PTE) is the task of extracting parenthetical translations from natural language documents. One of the main difficulties in PTE is to detect the left boundary of the translated term in preparenthetical text. In this article, we propose a collective approach that employs Markov logic to model multiple constraints used in the PTE task. We show how various constraints can be formulated and combined in a Markov logic network (MLN). Our experimental results show that the proposed collective PTE approach significantly outperforms a current state-of-the-art method, improving the average F-measure up to 27.11&percnt; compared to the previous word alignment approach. It also outperforms an individual MLN-based system by 8.2&percnt; and a system based on conditional random fields by 5.9&percnt;."}
