Maintenance of connectivity and exchange of data require an efficient way to manage the devices. Distributed beaconing defined by ECMA-368 is used to manage the network in fully distributed fashion. All the devices must acquire a unique beacon slot, with the beacon period accessed using a slotted Aloha scheme. In this paper, we study the efficiency of distributed beaconing in the presence of $k$ newcomer devices forming a closed system. Efficiency is measured in terms of energy consumption and network setup delay. ECMA-368 defines two distinct phases: extension and contraction. Both phases are analyzed with particular emphasis on the extension phase by means of an absorbing Markov chain model. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a systematic approach to model distributed beaconing by formulating two equivalent urn occupancy problems of the extension and contraction phases; 2) the use of exponential generating functions to obtain closed-form expressions of the transition probabilities of the absorbing Markov chain; and 3) comparison to computer simulations based on Opnet modeling and with the preexisting literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10565","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10566","fieldValue":" We consider wireless networks in which multiple paths are available between each source and destination. We allow each source to split traffic among all of its available paths, and we ask the question: How do we attain the lowest possible number of transmissions per unit time to support a given traffic matrix? Traffic bound in opposite directions over two wireless hops can utilize the â\u20ACœreverse carpoolingâ\u20AC? advantage of network coding in order to decrease the number of transmissions used. We call such coded hops â\u20ACœhyper-links.â\u20AC? With the reverse carpooling technique, longer paths might be cheaper than shorter ones. However, there is a peculiar situation among sourcesâ\u20AC\u201Dthe network coding advantage is realized only if there is traffic in both directions of a shared path. We consider the problem of routing with network coding by selfish agents (the sources) as a potential game and develop a method of state-space augmentation in which additional agents (the hyper-links) decouple sources' choices from each other by declaring a hyper-link capacity, allowing sources to split their traffic selfishly in a distributed fashion, and then changing the hyper-link capacity based on user actions. Furthermore, each hyper-link has a scheduling constraint in terms of the maximum number of transmissions allowed per unit time. We show that our two-level control scheme is stable and verify our analytical insights by simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10566","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10566","fieldValue":"ACM"}
