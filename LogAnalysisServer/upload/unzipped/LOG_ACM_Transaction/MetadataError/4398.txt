Recommender systems are very helpful for recommending potentially desirable items to users in unfamiliar domains, and cross-domain collaborative filtering is therefore an important emerging research topic. However, it is inevitable that the cold-start issue will be encountered in unfamiliar domains due to the lack of feedback data. The Bayesian approach shows that priors play an important role when there are insufficient data, which implies that recommendation performance can be significantly improved in cold-start domains if informative priors can be provided. Based on this idea, we propose a Weighted Irregular Tensor Factorization (WITF) model to leverage multi-domain feedback data across all users to learn the cross-domain priors w.r.t. both users and items. The features learned from WITF serve as the informative priors on the latent factors of users and items in terms of weighted matrix factorization models. Moreover, WITF is a unified framework for dealing with both explicit feedback and implicit feedback. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we studied three typical real-world cases in which a collection of empirical evaluations were conducted on real-world datasets to compare the performance of our model and other state-of-the-art approaches. The results show the superiority of our model over comparison models."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/24171","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: University of Technology, Sydney and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China (Hu, Liang); University of Technology, Sydney, Australia (Cao, Longbing; Xu, Guandong); Shanghai Technical Institute of Electronics &#x38; Information, Shanghai, China (Gu, Zhiping); Shanghai Dian Ji University, Shanghai, China (Yang, Dingyu); Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China (Cao, Jian)"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24171","fieldValue":"Learning Informative Priors from Heterogeneous Domains to Improve Recommendation in Cold-Start User Domains"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24172","fieldValue":" Exposing latent knowledge in geospatial trajectories has the potential to provide a better understanding of the movements of individuals and groups. Motivated by such a desire, this work presents the context tree, a new hierarchical data structure that summarises the context behind user actions in a single model. We propose a method for context tree construction that augments geospatial trajectories with land usage data to identify such contexts. Through evaluation of the construction method and analysis of the properties of generated context trees, we demonstrate the foundation for understanding and modelling behaviour afforded. Summarising user contexts into a single data structure gives easy access to information that would otherwise remain latent, providing the basis for better understanding and predicting the actions and behaviours of individuals and groups. Finally, we also present a method for pruning context trees for use in applications where it is desirable to reduce the size of the tree while retaining useful information."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24173","fieldValue":" Learning-to-Rank models based on additive ensembles of regression trees have been proven to be very effective for scoring query results returned by large-scale Web search engines. Unfortunately, the computational cost of scoring thousands of candidate documents by traversing large ensembles of trees is high. Thus, several works have investigated solutions aimed at improving the efficiency of document scoring by exploiting advanced features of modern CPUs and memory hierarchies. In this article, we present QuickScorer, a new algorithm that adopts a novel cache-efficient representation of a given tree ensemble, performs an interleaved traversal by means of fast bitwise operations, and supports ensembles of oblivious trees. An extensive and detailed test assessment is conducted on two standard Learning-to-Rank datasets and on a novel very large dataset we made publicly available for conducting significant efficiency tests. The experiments show unprecedented speedups over the best state-of-the-art baselines ranging from 1.9 Ã\u2014 to 6.6 Ã\u2014 . The analysis of low-level profiling traces shows that QuickScorer efficiency is due to its cache-aware approach in terms of both data layout and access patterns and to a control flow that entails very low branch mis-prediction rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/24173","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Ca&#8217; Foscari University of Venice, Venezia Mestre, Italy (Orlando, Salvatore); ISTI--CNR, Pisa, Italy (Lucchese, Claudio; Nardini, Franco Maria; Perego, Raffaele; Tonellotto, Nicola); Tiscali Italia S.p.A., Cagliari, Italy (Dato, Domenico); University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy (Venturini, Rossano)"}
