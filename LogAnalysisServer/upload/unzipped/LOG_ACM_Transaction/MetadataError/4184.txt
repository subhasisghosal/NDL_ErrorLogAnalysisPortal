The dynamics of interaction are explained largely in terms of the economic incentive to reduce the length of transaction-processing chains and the more political goal of extending managerial control. It is argued that examining the interaction of organizations and computer systems can contribute to a better theoretical understanding of the development of large computer systems and offer guidance to designers of user-computer interfaces. A graphical technique for depicting organizational interfaces is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23616","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23616","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23617","fieldValue":" The adoption of new computer communication systems into organizations requires behavioral change. Planning for successful adoption requires knowledge of individual organizational communication patterns and the relationship between those patterns and particular communication system solutions. This paper documents a sequence of studies of organizational communication. Needs for office communication systems were identified, as were social and psychological factors temporarily inhibiting their use. Strategies for assuring smooth adoption of such systems are highlighted."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23617","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23617","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1243","fieldValue":" Differential Evolution (DE) is a well-known Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) for solving global optimization problems. Practical experiences, however, show that DE is vulnerable to problems like slow and\/or premature convergence. In this article we propose a simple and modified DE framework, called MDE, which is a fusion of three recent modifications in DE: (1) Opposition-Based Learning (OBL); (2) tournament method for mutation; and (3) single population structure. These features have a specific role which helps in improving the performance of DE. While OBL helps in giving a good initial start to DE, the use of the tournament best base vector in the mutation phase helps in preserving the diversity. Finally the single population structure helps in faster convergence. Their synergized effect balances the exploitation and exploration capabilities of DE without compromising with the solution quality or the convergence rate. The proposed MDE is validated on a set of 25 standard benchmark problems, 7 nontraditional shifted benchmark functions proposed at the special session of CEC2008, and three engineering design problems. Numerical results and statistical analysis show that the proposed MDE is better than or at least comparable to the basic DE and several other state-of-the art DE variants."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1243","fieldValue":"ACM"}
