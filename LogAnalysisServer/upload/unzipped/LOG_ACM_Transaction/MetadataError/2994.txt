It is natural to ask whether the process of developing such rule bases may converge. Having developed sets of rules for specific programming tasks and domains, will they be helpful when other tasks and domains are considered? While it is too early to give definitive answers, experience with the rules of the PECOS system has been positive. Both during the process of developing the rule set and while developing rules for another domain, the existence of already codified rules proved very helpful."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19974","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19974","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2912","fieldValue":" Resolving ambiguity in the process of query translation is crucial to cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), given the short length of queries. This problem is even more challenging when only a bilingual dictionary is available, which is the focus of our work described here. In this paper, we will present a statistical framework for dictionary-based CLIR that estimates the translation probabilities of query words based on the monolingual word co-occurrence statistics. In addition, we will present two realizations of the proposed framework, i.e., the â\u20ACœmaximum coherence modelâ\u20AC? and the â\u20ACœspectral query-translation model,â\u20AC? that exploit different metrics for the coherence measurement between a translation of a query word and the theme of the entire query. Compared to previous work on dictionary-based CLIR, the proposed framework is advantageous in three aspects: (1) Translation probabilities are calculated explicitly to capture the uncertainty in translating queries; (2) translations of all query words are estimated simultaneously rather than independently; and (3) the formulated problem can be solved efficiently with a unique optimal solution. Empirical studies with Chinese--English cross-language information retrieval using TREC datasets have shown that the proposed models achieve a relative 10&percnt;--50&percnt; improvement, compared to other approaches that also exploit word co-occurrence statistics for query translation disambiguation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2912","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2912","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19975","fieldValue":" A specification technique, formally equivalent to finite-state machines, is offered as an alternative because it is inherently distributed and more comprehensible. When applied to modules whose complexity is dominated by control, the technique guides the analyst to an effective decomposition of complexity, encourages well-structured error handling, and offers an opportunity for parallel computation. When applied to distributed protocols, the technique provides a unique perspective and facilitates automatic detection of some classes of error. These applications are illustrated by a controller for a distributed telephone system and the full-duplex alternating-bit protocol for data communication. Several schemes are presented for executing the resulting specifications."}
