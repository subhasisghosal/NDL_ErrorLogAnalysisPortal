Intuitively, these are the lower and upper densities of the algorithmic information shared by x and y. We show that these quantities satisfy the main desiderata for a satisfactory measure of mutual algorithmic information. Our main theorem, the data processing inequality for mutual dimension, says that if f&colon; $R^m â\u2020\u2019 Rn is computable and Lipschitz, then the inequalities mdim(f(x)&colon; y) â\u2030¤ mdim(x&colon; y) and Mdim(f(x)&colon; y) â\u2030¤ Mdim(x&colon; y) hold for all x âˆˆ Rm and y âˆˆ Rt$. We use this inequality and related inequalities that we prove in like fashion to establish conditions under which various classes of computable functions on Euclidean space preserve or otherwise transform mutual dimensions between points."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12538","fieldValue":"Lpez-Ortiz, Alejandro"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12538","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of discovering overlapping communities in networks that we model as generalizations of the Set and Graph Packing problems with overlap. As usual for Set Packing problems, we seek a collection $S^â\u20AC² &subseteq; S consisting of at least k sets subject to certain disjointness restrictions. In the r-Set Packing with t-Membership, each element of U belongs to at most t sets of Sâ\u20AC², while in r-Set Packing with t-Overlap, each pair of sets in Sâ\u20AC² overlaps in at most t elements. For both problems, each set of S has at most r elements. Similarly, both of our Graph Packing problems seek a collection K of at least k subgraphs in a graph G, each isomorphic to a graph H &in; H. In H-Packing with t-Membership, each vertex of G belongs to at most t subgraphs of K, while in H-Packing with t-Overlap, each pair of subgraphs in K overlaps in at most t vertices. For both problems, each member of H has at most r vertices and m edges, where t, r, and m are constants. Here, we show NP-completeness results for all of our packing problems. Furthermore, we give a dichotomy result for the H-Packing with t-Membership problem analogous to the Kirkpatrick and Hell dichotomy [Kirkpatrick and Hell 1978]. Using polynomial parameter transformations, we reduce the r-Set Packing with t-Membership to a problem kernel with O((r + 1)rkr) elements and the H-Packing with t-Membership and its edge version to problem kernels with O((r + 1)rkr) and O((m + 1)mkm) vertices, respectively. On the other hand, by generalizing [Fellows et al. 2008; Moser 2009], we achieve a kernel with O(rrkr âˆ\u2019 t âˆ\u2019 1) elements for the r-Set Packing with t-Overlap and kernels with O(rrkr âˆ\u2019 t âˆ\u2019 1) and O(mmkm âˆ\u2019 t âˆ\u2019 1$) vertices for the H-Packing with t-Overlap and its edge version, respectively. In all cases, k is the input parameter, while t, r, and m are constants."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12538","fieldValue":"ACM"}
