Our method works with arbitrary constitutive models, is applicable to both passive and active materials (e.g. muscles), and works with simple tetrahedra without the need for multiple quadrature points or stabilization techniques. Although simple linear tetrahedra typically suffer from locking when modeling incompressible materials, our method enforces incompressibility per node (in a one-ring), and we demonstrate that it is free from locking. We correct errors in volume without introducing oscillations by treating position and velocity in separate implicit solves. Finally, we propose a novel method for treating both object contact and self-contact as linear constraints during the incompressible solve, alleviating issues in enforcing multiple possibly conflicting constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15769","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15769","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15770","fieldValue":" Animation techniques for controlling passive simulation are commonly based on an optimization paradigm: the user provides goals a priori, and sophisticated numerical methods minimize a cost function that represents these goals. Unfortunately, for multibody systems with discontinuous contact events these optimization problems can be highly nontrivial to solve, and many-hour offline optimizations, unintuitive parameters, and convergence failures can frustrate end-users and limit usage. On the other hand, users are quite adaptable, and systems which provide interactive feedback via an intuitive interface can leverage the user's own abilities to quickly produce interesting animations. However, the online computation necessary for interactivity limits scene complexity in practice. We introduce Many-Worlds Browsing, a method which circumvents these limits by exploiting the speed of multibody simulators to compute numerous example simulations in parallel (offline and online), and allow the user to browse and modify them interactively. We demonstrate intuitive interfaces through which the user can select among the examples and interactively adjust those parts of the scene that do not match his requirements. We show that using a combination of our techniques, unusual and interesting results can be generated for moderately sized scenes with under an hour of user time. Scalability is demonstrated by sampling much larger scenes using modest offline computations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15770","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15770","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15771","fieldValue":" We present a fast continuous collision detection (CCD) algorithm for articulated models using Taylor models and temporal culling. Our algorithm is a generalization of conservative advancement (CA) from convex models [Mirtich 1996] to articulated models with non-convex links. Given the initial and final configurations of a moving articulated model, our algorithm creates a continuous motion with constant translational and rotational velocities for each link, and checks for interferences between the articulated model under continuous motion and other models in the environment and for self-collisions. If collisions occur, our algorithm reports the first time of contact (TOC) as well as collision witness features. We have implemented our CCD algorithm and applied it to several challenging scenarios including locomotion generation, articulated-body dynamics and character motion planning. Our algorithm can perform CCDs including self-collision detection for articulated models consisting of many links and tens of thousands of triangles in 1.22 ms on average running on a 3.6 GHz Pentium 4 PC. This is an improvement on the performance of prior algorithms of more than an order of magnitude."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15771","fieldValue":"ACM"}
