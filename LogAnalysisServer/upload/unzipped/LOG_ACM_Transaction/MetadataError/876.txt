{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13532","fieldValue":" With the breakdown of Dennard‚\u20ACôs scaling over the past decade, performance growth of modern microprocessor design has largely relied on scaling core count in chip multiprocessors (CMPs). The challenge of chip power density, however, remains and demands new power management solutions. This work investigates a coordinated CMP systemwide Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) policy centered around shared resource utilization. This approach represents a new angle on the problem, differing from the conventional core-workload-driven approaches. The key component of our work is per-core DVFS leveraging a technique similar to TCP Vegas congestion control from networking. This TCP Vegas‚\u20AC\u201Cbased DVFS can potentially identify the synergy between power reduction and performance improvement. Further, this work includes uncore (on-chip interconnect and shared last level cache) and main memory DVFS policies coordinated with the per-core DVFS policy. Full system simulations on PARSEC benchmarks show that our technique reduces total energy dissipation by over 47&percnt; across all benchmarks with less than 2.3&percnt; performance degradation. Our work also leads to 12&percnt; more energy savings compared to a prior work CMP DVFS policy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13533","fieldValue":"Ho, Ching-Hsuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13533","fieldValue":"Chen, Yung-Chih"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13533","fieldValue":"Wang, Chun-Yao"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13533","fieldValue":"Huang, Ching-Yi"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13533","fieldValue":" Single-electron transistor (SET) at room temperature has been demonstrated as a promising device for extending Moore‚\u20ACôs law due to its ultra-low power consumption. Existing SET synthesis methods synthesize a Boolean network into a large reconfigurable SET array where the height of SET array equals the number of primary inputs. However, recent experiments on device level have shown that this height is restricted to a small number, say, 10, rather than arbitrary value due to the ultra-low driving strength of SET devices. On the other hand, the width of an SET array is also suggested to be a small value. Consequently, it is necessary to decompose a large SET array into a set of small SET arrays where each of them realizes a sub-function of the original circuit with no more than 10 inputs. Thus, this article presents two techniques for achieving area-efficient SET array decomposition: One is a width minimization algorithm for reducing the area of a single SET array; the other is a depth-bounded mapping algorithm, which decomposes a Boolean network into many sub-functions such that the widths of the corresponding SET arrays are balanced. The width minimization algorithm leads to a 25&percnt;--41&percnt; improvement compared to the state of the art, and the mapping algorithm achieves a 60&percnt; reduction in total area compared to a na√Øve approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13533","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13533","fieldValue":"ACM"}
