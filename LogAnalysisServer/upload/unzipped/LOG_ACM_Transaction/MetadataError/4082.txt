{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23181","fieldValue":" This article presents a novel Web search interaction feature that for a given query provides links to Web sites frequently visited by other users with similar information needs. These popular destinations complement traditional search results, allowing direct navigation to authoritative resources for the query topic. Destinations are identified using the history of the search and browsing behavior of many users over an extended time period, and their collective behavior provides a basis for computing source authority. They are drawn from the end of users' postquery browse trails where users may cease searching once they find relevant information. We describe a user study that compared the suggestion of destinations with the previously proposed suggestion of related queries as well as with traditional, unaided Web search. Results show that search enhanced by query suggestions outperforms other systems in terms of subject perceptions and search effectiveness for fact-finding search tasks. However, search enhanced by destination suggestions performs best for exploratory tasks with its best performance obtained from mining past user behavior at query-level granularity. We discuss the implications of these and other findings from our study for the design of search systems that utilize user behavior, in particular, user browse trails and popular destinations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23181","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23181","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23182","fieldValue":" Efficient management of distributed Web-based systems requires several mechanisms that decide on request dispatching, load balance, admission control, request redirection. The algorithms behind these mechanisms typically make fast decisions on the basis of the load conditions of the system resources. The architecture complexity and workloads characterizing most Web-based services make it extremely difficult to deduce a representative view of a resource load from collected measures that show extreme variability even at different time scales. Hence, any decision based on instantaneous or average views of the system load may lead to useless or even wrong actions. As an alternative, we propose a two-phase strategy that first aims to obtain a representative view of the load trend from measured system values and then applies this representation to support runtime decision systems. We consider two classical problems behind decisions: how to detect significant and nontransient load changes of a system resource and how to predict its future load behavior. The two-phase strategy is based on stochastic functions that are characterized by a computational complexity that is compatible with runtime decisions. We describe, test, and tune the two-phase strategy by considering as a first example a multitier Web-based system that is subject to different classes of realistic and synthetic workloads. Also, we integrate the proposed strategy into a framework that we validate by applying it to support runtime decisions in a cluster Web system and in a locally distributed Network Intrusion Detection System."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23182","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23182","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3261","fieldValue":" This paper introduces Crystallization Sonification, a sonification model for exploratory analysis of high-dimensional datasets. The model is designed to provide information about the intrinsic data dimensionality (which is a local feature) and the global data dimensionality, as well as the transitions between a local and global view on a dataset. Furthermore the sound allows to display the clustering in high-dimensional datasets. The model defines a crystal growth process in the high-dimensional data-space which starts at a user selected â\u20ACœcondensation nucleusâ\u20AC? and incrementally includes neighboring data according to some growth criterion. The sound summarizes the temporal evolution of this crystal growth process. For introducing the model, a simple growth law is used. Other growth laws which are used in the context of hierarchical clustering are also suited and their application in crystallization sonification offers new ways to inspect the results of data clustering as an alternative to dendrogram plots. In this paper, the sonification model is described and example sonifications are presented for some synthetic high-dimensional datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3261","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3261","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23183","fieldValue":"ACM"}
