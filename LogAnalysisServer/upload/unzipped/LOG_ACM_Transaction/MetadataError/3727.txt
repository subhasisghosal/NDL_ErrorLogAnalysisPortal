Specifically, nonexpert users have been providing a wealth of quantitative geospatial data (e.g., geotagged tweets or photos, online). With spatial reasoning being a basic form of human cognition, textual narratives expressing user travel experiences (e.g., travel blogs) would provide an even bigger source of geospatial data. Narratives typically contain qualitative geospatial data in the form of objects and spatial relations (e.g., â\u20ACœSt. Johnâ\u20AC™s church is to the North of the Acropolis museum.â\u20AC? The scope of this work is (i) to extract these spatial relations from textual narratives, (ii) to quantify (model) them, and (iii) to reason about object locations based only on the quantified spatial relations. We use information extraction methods to identify toponyms and spatial relations, and we formulate a quantitative approach based on distance and orientation features to represent the latter. Probability density functions (PDFs) for spatial relations are determined by means of a greedy expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm. These PDFs are then used to estimate unknown object locations. Experiments using a text corpus harvested from travel blog sites establish the considerable location estimation accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic and real-world scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21984","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21984","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21985","fieldValue":"Andrade, Marcus V A"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21985","fieldValue":"Magalhes, Salles V G"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21985","fieldValue":" This article presents TiledVS, a fast external algorithm and implementation for computing viewsheds. TiledVS is intended for terrains that are too large for internal memory, even more than 100,000Ã\u2014100,000 points. It subdivides the terrain into tiles that are stored compressed on disk and then paged into memory with a custom cache data structure and least recently used algorithm. If there is sufficient available memory to store a whole row of tiles, which is easy, then this specialized data management is faster than relying on the operating systemâ\u20AC™s virtual memory management. Applications of viewshed computation include siting radio transmitters, surveillance, and visual environmental impact measurement. TiledVS runs a rotating line of sight from the observer to points on the region boundary. For each boundary point, it computes the visibility of all terrain points close to the line of sight. The running time is linear in the number of points. No terrain tile is read more than twice. TiledVS is very fast, for instance, processing a 104,000Ã\u2014104,000 terrain on a modest computer with only 512MB of RAM took only 1Â½ hours. On large datasets, TiledVS was several times faster than competing algorithms, such as the ones included in GRASS. The source code of TiledVS is freely available for nonprofit researchers to study, use, and extend. A preliminary version of this algorithm appeared in a four-page ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS 2012 conference paper, â\u20ACœMore Efficient Terrain Viewshed Computation on Massive Datasets Using External Memory.â\u20AC? This more detailed version adds the fast lossless compression stage that reduces the time by 30&percnt; to 40&percnt;, and many more experiments and comparisons."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21985","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21985","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21986","fieldValue":" Novel Web technologies and resulting applications have led to a participatory data ecosystem that, when utilized properly, will lead to more rewarding services. In this work, we investigate the case of Location-Based Services, specifically how to improve the typical location-based Point-of-Interest (POI) request processed as a k-Nearest-Neighbor query. This work introduces Links-of-Interest (LOI) between POIs as a means to increase the relevance and overall result quality of such queries. By analyzing user-contributed content in the form of travel blogs, we establish the overall popularity of an LOI, that is, how frequently the respective POI pair was visited and is mentioned in the same context. Our contribution is a query-processing method for so-called k-Relevant Nearest Neighbor (k-RNN) queries that considers spatial proximity in combination with LOI information to retrieve close-by and relevant (as judged by the crowd) POIs. Our method is based on intelligently combining indices for spatial data (a spatial grid) and for relevance data (a graph) during query processing. Using landmarks as a means to prune the search space in the Relevance Graph, we improve the proposed methods. Using in addition A*-directed search, the query performance can be further improved. An experimental evaluation using real and synthetic data establishes that our approach efficiently solves the k-RNN problem."}
