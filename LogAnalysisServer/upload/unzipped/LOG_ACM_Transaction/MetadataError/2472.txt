An open problem asks whether Channel Assignment admits an $O(c^n) (times a polynomial in the bit size) time algorithm, where n is a number of the vertices, for a constant c independent of the weights on the edges. We answer this question in the negative. Indeed, we show that in the standard Word RAM model, there is no 2o(nlog n) (times a polynomial in the bit size) time algorithm solving Channel Assignment unless the exponential time hypothesis fails. Note that the currently best known algorithm works in time O&ast;(n&excl;) &equals; 2O(nlog n)$, so our lower bound is tight (where the O&ast;() notation suppresses polynomial factors)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2722","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2722","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18359","fieldValue":"ACM"}
