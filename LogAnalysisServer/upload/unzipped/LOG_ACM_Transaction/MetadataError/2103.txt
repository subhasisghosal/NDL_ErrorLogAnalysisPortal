{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17109","fieldValue":" Complex specular surfaces under sharp point lighting show a fascinating glinty appearance, but rendering it is an unsolved problem. Using Monte Carlo pixel sampling for this purpose is impractical: the energy is concentrated in tiny highlights that take up a minuscule fraction of the pixel. We instead compute an accurate solution using a completely different deterministic approach. Our method considers the true distribution of normals on a surface patch seen through a single pixel, which can be highly complex. We show how to evaluate this distribution efficiently, assuming a Gaussian pixel footprint and Gaussian intrinsic roughness. We also take advantage of hierarchical pruning of position-normal space to rapidly find texels that might contribute to a given normal distribution evaluation. Our results show complex, temporally varying glints from materials such as bumpy plastics, brushed and scratched metals, metallic paint and ocean waves."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17109","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17109","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17110","fieldValue":" We present a generalized linear light source solution to estimate both the local shading frame and anisotropic surface reflectance of a planar spatially varying material sample. We generalize linear light source reflectometry by modulating the intensity along the linear light source, and show that a constant and two sinusoidal lighting patterns are sufficient for estimating the local shading frame and anisotropic surface reflectance. We propose a novel reconstruction algorithm based on the key observation that after factoring out the tangent rotation, the anisotropic surface reflectance lies in a low rank subspace. We exploit the differences in tangent rotation between surface points to infer the low rank subspace and fit each surface point's reflectance function in the projected low rank subspace to the observations. We propose two prototype acquisition devices for capturing surface reflectance that differ on whether the camera is fixed with respect to the linear light source or fixed with respect to the material sample. We demonstrate convincing results obtained from reflectance scans of surfaces with different reflectance and shading frame variations."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17110","fieldValue":"BRDF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17110","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17110","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17111","fieldValue":"dEon, Eugene"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17111","fieldValue":" We present a general and practical method for computing BSDFs of layered materials. Its ingredients are transport-theoretical models of isotropic or anisotropic scattering layers and smooth or rough boundaries of conductors and dielectrics. Following expansion into a directional basis that supports arbitrary composition, we are able to efficiently and accurately synthesize BSDFs for a great variety of layered structures. Reflectance models created by our system correctly account for multiple scattering within and between layers, and in the context of a rendering system they are efficient to evaluate and support texturing and exact importance sampling. Although our approach essentially involves tabulating reflectance functions in a Fourier basis, the generated models are compact to store due to the inherent sparsity of our representation, and are accurate even for narrowly peaked functions. While methods for rendering general layered surfaces have been investigated in the past, ours is the first system that supports arbitrary layer structures while remaining both efficient and accurate. We validate our model by comparing to measurements of real-world examples of layered materials, and we demonstrate an interactive visual design tool that enables easy exploration of the space of layered materials. We provide a fully practical, high-performance implementation in an open-source rendering system."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17111","fieldValue":"BRDF"}
