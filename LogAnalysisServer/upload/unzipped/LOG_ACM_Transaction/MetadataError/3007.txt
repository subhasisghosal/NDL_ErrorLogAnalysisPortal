Each machine in the network can be defined by a directed graph whose nodes represent the machine states and whose edges represent its transitions. In general, for a node in one of the machines to be live (i.e., encountered infinitely often during the course of communication), each machine in the network should progress in some fair fashion. We define three graduated notions of fair progress (namely, node fairness, edge fairness, and network fairness), and on this basis we define three corresponding degrees of node liveness. We discuss techniques to verify that a given node is live under each of these fairness assumptions. These techniques can be automated; and they are effective even if the network under consideration has an infinite number of reachable states. We use our techniques to establish the liveness of some practical communication protocols; these include an unbounded start-stop protocol, an unbounded alternating bit protocol, and a simplified version of the CSMA\/CD protocol for local area networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2915","fieldValue":"Wu, Chung-Hsien"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2915","fieldValue":"Su, Hung-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2915","fieldValue":"Chiu, Yu-Hsien"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2915","fieldValue":"Lin, Chia-Hung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2915","fieldValue":" This article presents a transfer-based statistical model for Chinese to Taiwanese sign-language (TSL) translation. Two sets of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) are derived from a Chinese Treebank and a bilingual parallel corpus. In this approach, a three-stage translation model is proposed. First, the input Chinese sentence is parsed into possible phrase structure trees (PSTs) based on the Chinese PCFGs. Second, the Chinese PSTs are then transferred into TSL PSTs according to the transfer probabilities between the context-free grammar (CFG) rules of Chinese and TSL derived from the bilingual parallel corpus. Finally, the TSL PSTs are used to generate the possible translation results. The Viterbi algorithm is adopted to obtain the best translation result via the three-stage translation. For evaluation, three objective evaluation metrics including AER, Top-N, and BLUE and one subjective evaluation metric using MOS were used. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the IBM Model 3 in the task of Chinese to sign-language translation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2915","fieldValue":"ACM"}
