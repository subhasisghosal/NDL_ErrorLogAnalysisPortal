The current best upper bounds for the Bayesian price of anarchy (BPoA) of these auctions are e\/(e âˆ\u2019 1) [Syrgkanis and Tardos 2013] and 2 [Feldman et al. 2013], respectively. We provide matching lower bounds for both cases even for the case of full information and for mixed Nash equilibria via an explicit construction. We present an alternative proof of the upper bound of e\/(e âˆ\u2019 1) for FPAs with fractionally së«?itive valuations that reveals the worst-case price distribution, which is used as a building block for the matching lower bound construction. We generalize our results to a general class of item bidding auctions that we call bid-dependent auctions (including FPAs and all-pay auctions) where the winner is always the highest bidder and each bidderâ\u20AC™s payment depends only on his own bid. Finally, we apply our techniques to discriminatory price multiunit auctions. We complement the results of de Keijzer et al. [2013] for the case of së«?itive valuations by providing a matching lower bound of 2. For the case of submodular valuations, we provide a lower bound of 1.109. For the same class of valuations, we were able to reproduce the upper bound of e\/(e âˆ\u2019 1) using our nonsmooth approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6057","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6057","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6058","fieldValue":" The price of anarchy (PoA) in congestion games has attracted a lot of research over the past decade. This has resulted in a thorough understanding of this concept. In contrast, the price of stability (PoS), which is an equally interesting concept, is much less understood. In this article, we consider congestion games with polynomial cost functions with nonnegative coefficients and maximum degree d. We give matching bounds for the PoS in such gamesâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, our technique provides the exact value for any degree d. For linear congestion games, tight bounds were previously known. Those bounds hold even for the more restricted case of dominant equilibria, which may not exist. We give a separation result showing that this is not possible for congestion games with quadratic cost functionsâ\u20AC\u201Din other words, the PoA for the subclass of games that admit a dominant strategy equilibrium is strictly smaller than the PoS for the general class."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6058","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6058","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6059","fieldValue":" We consider truthfulness concepts for auctions with payments based on first- and second-order stochastic dominance. We assume bidders consider wealth in standard quasilinear form as valuation minus payments. Additionally, they are sensitive to risk in the distribution of wealth stemming from randomized mechanisms. First- and second-order stochastic dominance are well known to capture risk sensitivity, and we apply these concepts to capture truth-telling incentives for bidders. As our first main result, we provide a complete characterization of all social-choice functions over binary single-parameter domains that can be implemented by a mechanism that is truthful in first- and second-order stochastic dominance. We show that these are exactly the social-choice functions implementable by truthful-in-expectation mechanisms, and we provide a novel payment rule that guarantees stochastic dominance. As our second main result we extend the celebrated randomized metarounding approach for truthful-in-expectation mechanisms in packing domains. We design mechanisms that are truthful in first-order stochastic dominance by spending only a logarithmic factor in the approximation guarantee."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6059","fieldValue":"ACM"}
