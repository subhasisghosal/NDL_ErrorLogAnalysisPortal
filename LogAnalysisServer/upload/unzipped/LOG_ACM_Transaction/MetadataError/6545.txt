The key feature of our â\u20ACœGeneralized Integrated Learning Architectureâ\u20AC? (GILA) is a set of heterogeneous independent learning and reasoning (ILR) components, coordinated by a central meta-reasoning executive (MRE). The ILRs are weakly coupled in the sense that all coordination during learning and performance happens through the MRE. Each ILR learns independently from a small number of expert demonstrations of a complex task. During performance, each ILR proposes partial solutions to subproblems posed by the MRE, which are then selected from and pieced together by the MRE to produce a complete solution. The heterogeneity of the learner-reasoners allows both learning and problem solving to be more effective because their abilities and biases are complementary and synergistic. We describe the application of this novel learning and problem solving architecture to the domain of airspace management, where multiple requests for the use of airspaces need to be deconflicted, reconciled, and managed automatically. Formal evaluations show that our system performs as well as or better than humans after learning from the same training data. Furthermore, GILA outperforms any individual ILR run in isolation, thus demonstrating the power of the ensemble architecture for learning and problem solving."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7440","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7440","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7441","fieldValue":" Many applications naturally involve time series data and the vector autoregression (VAR), and the structural VAR (SVAR) are dominant tools to investigate relations between variables in time series. In the first part of this work, we show that the SVAR method is incapable of identifying contemporaneous causal relations for Gaussian process. In addition, least squares estimators become unreliable when the scales of the problems are large and observations are limited. In the remaining part, we propose an approach to apply Bayesian network learning algorithms to identify SVARs from time series data in order to capture both temporal and contemporaneous causal relations, and avoid high-order statistical tests. The difficulty of applying Bayesian network learning algorithms to time series is that the sizes of the networks corresponding to time series tend to be large, and high-order statistical tests are required by Bayesian network learning algorithms in this case. To overcome the difficulty, we show that the search space of conditioning sets d-separating two vertices should be a subset of the Markov blankets. Based on this fact, we propose an algorithm enabling us to learn Bayesian networks locally, and make the largest order of statistical tests independent of the scales of the problems. Empirical results show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7441","fieldValue":"VAR"}
