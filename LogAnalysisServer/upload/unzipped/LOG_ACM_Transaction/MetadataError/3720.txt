However, conventional search engines consider a search query corresponding only to a simple search task. In order to accomplish a complex search task, which consists of multiple subtask search goals, users usually have to issue a series of queries. For example, the complex search task â\u20ACœtravel to Dubaiâ\u20AC? may involve several subtask search goals, including reserving hotel room, surveying Dubai landmarks, booking flights, and so forth. Therefore, a user can efficiently accomplish his or her complex search task if search engines can predict the complex search task with a variety of subtask search goals. In this work, we propose a complex search task model (CSTM) to deal with this problem. The CSTM first groups queries into complex search task clusters, and then generates subtask search goals from each complex search task cluster. To raise the performance of CSTM, we exploit four web resources including community question answering, query logs, search engine result pages, and clicked pages. Experimental results show that our CSTM is effective in identifying the comprehensive subtask search goals of a complex search task."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21959","fieldValue":" We propose SSketch, a novel automated framework for efficient analysis of dynamic big data with dense (non-sparse) correlation matrices on reconfigurable platforms. SSketch targets streaming applications where each data sample can be processed only once and storage is severely limited. Our framework adaptively learns from the stream of input data and updates a corresponding ensemble of lower-dimensional data structures, a.k.a., a sketch matrix. A new sketching methodology is introduced that tailors the problem of transforming the big data with dense correlations to an ensemble of lower-dimensional subspaces such that it is suitable for hardware-based acceleration performed by reconfigurable hardware. The new method is scalable, while it significantly reduces costly memory interactions and enhances matrix computation performance by leveraging coarse-grained parallelism existing in the dataset. SSketch provides an automated optimization methodology for creating the most accurate data sketch for a given set of user-defined constraints, including runtime and power as well as platform constraints such as memory. To facilitate automation, SSketch takes advantage of a Hardware\/Software (HW\/SW) co-design approach: It provides an Application Programming Interface that can be customized for rapid prototyping of an arbitrary matrix-based data analysis algorithm. Proof-of-concept evaluations on a variety of visual datasets with more than 11 million non-zeros demonstrate up to a 200-fold speedup on our hardware-accelerated realization of SSketch compared to a software-based deployment on a general-purpose processor."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21959","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21959","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21959","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21960","fieldValue":" Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are becoming increasingly powerful. In addition to their huge hardware resources, they are also integrated into complete systems on chips (SOCs), e.g., in the latest Xilinx Zynq or Altera Stratix platforms. However, cooperation between FPGAs and their surroundings, and the flexibility of hardware task management could still be improved. For instance, mechanisms have yet to be automated to allow multi-user approaches. A reconfigurable resource can be shared between applications or users only if it has a context-switch ability allowing applications to be paused and resumed in response to system demands. Here, we present a high-level synthesis (HLS) design flow producing a context-switch-capable circuit. The design flow manipulates the intermediate representation of an HLS tool to build the context extraction mechanism and to optimize performance for the circuit produced. The method is based on efficient checkpoint selection and insertion of a powerful scan-chain into the initial circuit. This scan-chain can extract flip-flops or memory content. Experiments with the system produced show that it has a low hardware overhead for many benchmark applications, and that the hardware added has a negligible impact on application performance. Comparisons with current standard methods highlight the efficiency of our contributions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21960","fieldValue":"ACM"}
