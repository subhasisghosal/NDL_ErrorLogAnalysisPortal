The method differs from most othersâ\u20AC\u201Dthat we refer as unaryâ\u20AC\u201Dwhere salient regions are defined by analyzing only images of the same individual. We extract a set of multiscale patches from each face image before projecting them into a common feature space. The degree of â\u20ACœdistinctivenessâ\u20AC? of any patch depends on its distance in feature space from patches mapped from other individuals. First a pairwise analysis is developed and then a simple generalization to the multiple-face case is proposed. A perceptual experiment, involving 45 observers, indicates the method to be fairly compatible with how humans mark faces as distinct. A quantitative example of face authentication is also performed in order to show the essential role played by the distinctive information. A comparative analysis shows that performance of our n-ary approach is as good as several contemporary unary, or binary, methods, while tapping a complementary source of information. Furthermore, we show it can also provide a useful degree of illumination invariance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23922","fieldValue":"Baeza-Yates, Ricardo"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23922","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23922","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23923","fieldValue":"Rijke, Maarten de"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23923","fieldValue":" Document-centric XML is a mixture of text and structure. With the increased availability of document-centric XML documents comes a need for query facilities in which both structural constraints and constraints on the content of the documents can be expressed. How does the expressiveness of languages for querying XML documents help users to express their information needs? We address this question from both an experimental and a theoretical point of view. Our experimental analysis compares a structure-ignorant with a structure-aware retrieval approach using the test suite of the INEX XML Retrieval Evaluation Initiative. Theoretically, we create two mathematical models of users' knowledge of a set of documents and define query languages which exactly fit these models. One of these languages corresponds to an XML version of fielded search, the other to the INEX query language.Our main experimental findings are: First, while structure is used in varying degrees of complexity, two-thirds of the queries can be expressed in a fielded-search-like format which does not use the hierarchical structure of the documents. Second, three-quarters of the queries use constraints on the context of the elements to be returned; these contextual constraints cannot be captured by ordinary keyword queries. Third, structure is used as a search hint, and not as a strict requirement, when judged against the underlying information need. Fourth, the use of structure in queries functions as a precision enhancing device."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23923","fieldValue":"ACM"}
