Unlike existing anonymity schemes, we consider all parties that can intercept communications between a mobile user and a server as potential privacy threats. We formally quantify the privacy exposure and the protection of our system in the presence of malicious neighboring peers, global WiFi eavesdroppers, and omniscient mobile network operators, which possibly collude to breach userâ\u20AC™s anonymity or disrupt the communication. We also describe how a micropayment scheme that suits our mobile scenario can provide incentives for peers to collaborate in the protocol. Finally, we evaluate the network overhead and attack resiliency of our protocol using a prototype implementation deployed in Emulab and Orbit, and our probabilistic model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24445","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24445","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3371","fieldValue":" In this article, we investigate the perception of optically simulated haptic feedback. The perception of optically and mechanically simulated bumps and holes was tested experimentally. In an earlier article, we have described the active cursor technique, a method to simulate haptic feedback optically without resorting to special mechanical force feedback devices, commonly applied to produce haptic percepts in computer interfaces. The operation of the force feedback device is substituted by tiny displacements on the cursor position relative to the intended force. This method exploits the domination of the visual over the haptic modality. Results show that people can recognize optically simulated bump and hole structures and that active cursor displacements influence the haptic perception of bumps and holes. Depending on the simulated strength of the force, optically simulated haptic feedback can take precedence over mechanically simulated haptic feedback and also the other way around. When optically simulated and mechanically simulated haptic feedback counteract each other, however, the weight attributed to each source of haptic information differs from user to user. It is concluded that active cursor displacements can be used to simulate the operation of mechanical force feedback devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3371","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3371","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24446","fieldValue":" The advent of digital environments has generated significant benefits for businesses, organizations, governments, academia and societies in general. Today, over millions of transactions take place on the Internet. Although the widespread use of digital environments has generally provided opportunities for societies, a number of threats have limited their adoption. The de-facto standard today is for certification authorities to authenticate the identity of service providers while trust on the provided services is implied. This approach has certain shortcomings, for example, single point of failure, implied trust rather than explicit trust and others. One approach for minimizing such threats is to introduce an effective and resilient trust mechanism that is capable of determining the trustworthiness of service providers in providing their services. Determining the trustworthiness of services reduces invalid transactions in digital environments and further encourages collaborations. Evaluating trustworthiness of a service provider without any prior historical transactions (i.e. the initial transaction) pose a number of challenging issues. This article presents TIDE - a decentralized reputation trust mechanism that determines the initial trustworthiness of entities in digital environments. TIDE improves the precision of trust computation by considering ratersâ\u20AC™ feedback, number of transactions, credibility, incentive to encourage ratersâ\u20AC™ participation, strategy for updating ratersâ\u20AC™ category, and safeguards against dynamic personalities. Furthermore, TIDE classifies raters into three categories and promotes the flexibility and customization through its parameters. Evaluation of TIDE against several attack vectors demonstrates its accuracy, robustness and resilience."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24446","fieldValue":"ACM"}
