Unfortunately, performance of current network protocols can vary significantly because of various interferences and environmental changes. Current protocols estimate link quality based on the reception of probe packets over a short time period. This method is neither efficient nor accurate enough to capture the dramatic variations of link quality. Therefore, we propose a link metric called competence that characterizes links over a longer period of time. We combine competence with current short-term estimations in routing algorithm designs. To further improve network performance, we have designed a distributed route maintenance framework based on feedback control solutions. This framework allows every link along an end-to-end (E2E) path to adjust its link protocol parameters, such as transmission power and number of retransmissions, to ensure specified E2E reliability and latency under dynamic link qualities. Our solutions are evaluated in both extensive simulations and real system experiments. In real system evaluations with 48 T-Motes, our overall solution improves E2E packet delivery ratio over existing solutions by up to 40&percnt; while reducing transmission energy consumption by up to 22&percnt;. Importantly, our solution also achieves more stable and better transient performance than current approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21574","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21574","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3067","fieldValue":" A novel method to induce wide-coverage Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) resources for Japanese is proposed in this article. For some languages including English, the availability of large annotated corpora and the development of data-based induction of lexicalized grammar have enabled deep parsing, i.e., parsing based on lexicalized grammars. However, deep parsing for Japanese has not been widely studied. This is mainly because most Japanese syntactic resources are represented in chunk-based dependency structures, while previous methods for inducing grammars are dependent on tree corpora. To translate syntactic information presented in chunk-based dependencies to phrase structures as accurately as possible, integration of annotation from multiple dependency-based corpora is proposed. Our method first integrates dependency structures and predicate-argument information and converts them into phrase structure trees. The trees are then transformed into CCG derivations in a similar way to previously proposed methods. The quality of the conversion is empirically evaluated in terms of the coverage of the obtained CCG lexicon and the accuracy of the parsing with the grammar. While the transforming process used in this study is specialized for Japanese, the framework of our method would be applicable to other languages for which dependency-based analysis has been regarded as more appropriate than phrase structure-based analysis due to morphosyntactic features."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21575","fieldValue":" Understanding indoor mobility patterns of people is important in applications such as targeted advertisement, microclimate control, and delivery of anticipatory notifications. In this article, we devise GreenLocs, a nonparametric, profiling-free, yet lightweight and energy-efficient inference framework, to identify recurring and new places that mobile users visit indoor. Combining WiFi scans and accelerometer readings, GreenLocs can accurately decide a new place and a revisited place with just a few radio signal strength (RSS) samples. GreenLocs consists of three major building blocks, namely, missing data handling algorithms, a nonparametric Bayesian inference model, and a stopping rule, which significantly increases the energy efficiency of the system. GreenLocs is shown to be robust to signal variations and missing data through experimental evaluations using traces collected from mobile phones of different brands\/models."}
