The effectiveness of a network upgrade\/planning decision is intrinsically tied to the ability of a provider to retain and grow its customer population. This paper examines the crucial linkage between network performance, customer satisfaction and profitability of network service, and presents an analytical modeling approach from market science perspective. We derive a generalized forecasting model that projects service profitability from the underlying network service infrastructure and the subscriber population. Through simulation studies and analysis, we show how such approach captures key factors and trends influencing service profitability and howit can significantly improve current network planning and upgrade processes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9672","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9672","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9672","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9673","fieldValue":" An erasure correcting scheme is rateless if it is designed to tolerate any pattern of packet loss and reveal the transmitted information after a certain number of packets is received. On the one hand, transmission schemes that use rateless erasure correcting schemes do not usually use a feedback channel. However, they may require significant amount of additional processing by both the sender and the receiver. On the other hand, automatic repeated request protocols use a feedback channel to assist the sender, and do not usually require information processing. In this work we present a combined approach, where a lean feedback channel is used to assist the sender to efficiently transmit the information. Our Real-Time oblivious approach minimizes the processing time and the memory requirements of the receiver and, therefore, fits a variety of receiving devices. In addition, the transmission is real-time where the expected number of original packets revealed when a packet is received is approximately the same throughout the entire transmission process. We use our end-to-end scheme as a base for broadcast (and multicast) schemes. An overlay tree structure is used to convey the information to a large number of receivers. Moreover, the receivers may download the information from a number of senders or even migrate from one sender to another."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9673","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9673","fieldValue":"ARQ"}
