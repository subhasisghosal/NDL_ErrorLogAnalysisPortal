A valid solution to this problem completely covers the domain with templates such that the templates do not overlap. We generalize existing specialized solutions and formulate a general layout problem by modeling important constraints and admissible template deformations. Our main idea is to break the layout algorithm into two steps: a discrete step to lay out the approximate template positions and a continuous step to refine the template shapes. Our approach is suitable for a large class of applications, including floorplans, urban layouts, and arts and design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17092","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17092","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17093","fieldValue":" Global illumination algorithms using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are well-known for their efficiency in scenes with complex light transport. Samples in such algorithms are generated as a history of Markov chain states so that they are distributed according to the contributions to the image. The whole process is done based only on the information of the path contributions and user-defined transition probabilities from one state to the others. In light transport simulation, however, there is more information that can be used to improve the efficiency of path sampling. A notable example is multiple importance sampling (MIS) in bidirectional path tracing, which utilizes the probability densities of constructing a given path with different estimators. While MIS is a powerful ordinary Monte Carlo method, how to incorporate such additional information into MCMC sampling has been an open problem. We introduce a novel MCMC sampling framework, primary space serial tempering, which fuses the ideas of MCMC sampling and MIS for the first time. The key idea is to explore not only the sample space using a Markov chain, but also different estimators to generate samples by utilizing the information already available for MIS. Based on this framework, we also develop a novel rendering algorithm, multiplexed Metropolis light transport, which automatically and adaptively constructs paths with appropriate techniques as predicted by MIS. The final algorithm is very easy to implement, yet in many cases shows comparable (or even better) performance than significantly more complex MCMC rendering algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17094","fieldValue":"ik, Martin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17094","fieldValue":" Monte Carlo techniques for light transport simulation rely on importance sampling when constructing light transport paths. Previous work has shown that suitable sampling distributions can be recovered from particles distributed in the scene prior to rendering. We propose to represent the distributions by a parametric mixture model trained in an on-line (i.e. progressive) manner from a potentially infinite stream of particles. This enables recovering good sampling distributions in scenes with complex lighting, where the necessary number of particles may exceed available memory. Using these distributions for sampling scattering directions and light emission significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art light transport simulation algorithms when dealing with complex lighting."}
