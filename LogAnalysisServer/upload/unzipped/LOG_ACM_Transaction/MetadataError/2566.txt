The process on which the algorithm is based involves the truncation of an infinite sequence with a corresponding analysis of the truncation error. This error is estimated by means of (asymptotic) formulas, which are not only applicable to the real line, but also extendible to the complex plane. This fact makes the algorithm extendible to the complex plane also. However, the rate of convergence decreases sharply when the complex argument is close to the negative real axis. In order to make the algorithm more efficient, analytic continuation into a strip about the negative real axis is carried out by limited use of power series. The analytic details needed for a portable computational algorithm are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/2753","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"December 2005\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/2778\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, December 2005\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"September 2005\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/2777\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, September 2005\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"June 2005\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/2776\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, June 2005\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"March 2005\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/2775\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, March 2005\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18648","fieldValue":" The algorithm computes exponential integrals En(z) for integer orders n â\u2030¥ 1 and complex z in -Ï\u20AC < arg z â\u2030¤ Ï\u20AC.
