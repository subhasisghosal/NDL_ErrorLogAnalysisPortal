{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17402","fieldValue":" The visual system constantly adapts to different luminance levels when viewing natural scenes. The state of visual adaptation is the key parameter in many visual models. While the time-course of such adaptation is well understood, there is little known about the spatial pooling that drives the adaptation signal. In this work we propose a new empirical model of local adaptation, that predicts how the adaptation signal is integrated in the retina. The model is based on psychophysical measurements on a high dynamic range (HDR) display. We employ a novel approach to model discovery, in which the experimental stimuli are optimized to find the most predictive model. The model can be used to predict the steady state of adaptation, but also conservative estimates of the visibility (detection) thresholds in complex images. We demonstrate the utility of the model in several applications, such as perceptual error bounds for physically based rendering, determining the backlight resolution for HDR displays, measuring the maximum visible dynamic range in natural scenes, simulation of afterimages, and gaze-dependent tone mapping."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17402","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17402","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17403","fieldValue":" We propose a color reproduction framework for creating specularly reflecting color images printed on a metallic substrate that change hue or chroma upon in-plane rotation by 90°. This framework is based on the anisotropic dot gain of line halftones when viewed under specular reflection. The proposed framework relies on a spectral prediction model specially conceived for predicting the color of non-rotated and of 90° in-plane rotated cross-halftones formed of superpositions of horizontal and vertical cyan, magenta and yellow line halftones. Desired non-rotated and rotated image colors are mapped onto the sub-gamut allowing for the desired hue or chroma shift and then, using a 6D correspondence table, converted to optimal cross-halftone ink surface coverages. The proposed recolorization and decolorization framework is especially effective for creating surprising effects such as image parts whose hues change, or gray regions that become colorful. It can be adapted to commercial printers capable of printing with cyan, magenta and yellow inks on substrates formed by an ink attracting polymer lying on top of a metallic film layer. Applications may include art, advertisement, exhibitions and document security."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17403","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17403","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17404","fieldValue":"Wong, Tien-Tsin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17404","fieldValue":"Heng, Pheng-Ann"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17404","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose a novel approach to simplify sketch drawings. The core problem is how to group sketchy strokes meaningfully, and this depends on how humans understand the sketches. The existing methods mainly rely on thresholding low-level geometric properties among the strokes, such as proximity, continuity and parallelism. However, it is not uncommon to have strokes with equal geometric properties but different semantics. The lack of semantic analysis will lead to the inability in differentiating the above semantically different scenarios. In this paper, we point out that, due to the gestalt phenomenon of closure, the grouping of strokes is actually highly influenced by the interpretation of regions. On the other hand, the interpretation of regions is also influenced by the interpretation of strokes since regions are formed and depicted by strokes. This is actually a chicken-or-the-egg dilemma and we solve it by an iterative cyclic refinement approach. Once the formed stroke groups are stabilized, we can simplify the sketchy strokes by replacing each stroke group with a smooth curve. We evaluate our method on a wide range of different sketch styles and semantically meaningful simplification results can be obtained in all test cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17404","fieldValue":"ACM"}
