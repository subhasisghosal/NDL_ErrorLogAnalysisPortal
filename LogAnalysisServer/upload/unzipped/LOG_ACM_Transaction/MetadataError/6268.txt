Our approach performs a random walk over the space of system inputs guided by a robustness metric defined by the MTL property. Robustness is guiding the search for a falsifying behavior by exploring trajectories with smaller robustness values. The resulting testing framework can be applied to a wide class of cyber-physical systems (CPS). We show through experiments on complex system models that using our framework can help automatically falsify properties with more consistency as compared to other means, such as uniform sampling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6691","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6691","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6692","fieldValue":" Video coding and compression are essential components of multimedia services but are known to be computationally intensive and energy demanding. Traditional video coding paradigms, predictive and distributed video coding (PVC and DVC), result in excessive computation at either the encoder (PVC) or decoder (DVC). Several recent papers have proposed a hybrid PVC\/DVC codec which shares the video coding workload between encoder and decoder. In this article, we propose a controller for such hybrid coders that considers energy and temperature to dynamically split the coding workload of a system comprised of one encoder and one decoder. We also present two heuristic algorithms for determining safe operating temperatures in the controller solution: (1) stable state thermal modeling algorithm, which focuses on long term temperatures, and (2) transient thermal modeling algorithm, which is better for short-term thermal behavior. Results show that the proposed algorithms result in more balanced energy utilization, improve overall system lifetime, and reduce operating temperatures when compared to strictly PVC and DVC systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6692","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6692","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6693","fieldValue":" Capturing program and data traces during program execution unobtrusively on-the-fly is crucial in debugging and testing of cyber-physical systems. However, tracing a complete program unobtrusively is often cost-prohibitive, requiring large on-chip trace buffers and wide trace ports. This article describes a new hardware-based load data value filtering technique called Cache First-access Tracking. Coupled with an effective variable encoding scheme, this technique achieves a significant reduction of load data value traces, from 5.86 to 56.39 times depending on the data cache size, thus enabling cost-effective, unobtrusive on-the-fly tracing and debugging."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6150","fieldValue":"Issue 4(Special Section on Wireless Health Systems, On-Chip and Off-Chip Network Architectures), June 2013"}
