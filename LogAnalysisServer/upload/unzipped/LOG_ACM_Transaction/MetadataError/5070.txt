A faulty implementation of the context-aware features may lead to unpredictable behavior with adverse effects. In software testing, one of the most important research issues is to determine the sufficiency of a test suite to verify the software under test. Existing adequacy criteria for testing traditional software, however, have not explored the dimension of serial test inputs and have not considered context changes when constructing test suites. In this article, we define the concept of context diversity to capture the extent of context changes in serial inputs and propose three strategies to study how context diversity may improve the effectiveness of the data-flow testing criteria. Our case study shows that the strategy that uses test cases with higher context diversity can significantly improve the effectiveness of existing data-flow testing criteria for context-aware pervasive software. In addition, test suites with higher context diversity are found to execute significantly longer paths, which may provide a clue that reveals why context diversity can contribute to the improvement of effectiveness of test suites."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3836","fieldValue":"Lee, Chin-Hui"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3836","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework for goal-driven spoken dialog systems. A new dynamic stochastic state (DS-state) is then defined to characterize the goal set of a dialog state at different stages of the dialog process. Furthermore, an entropy minimization dialog management (EMDM) strategy is also proposed to combine with the DS-states to facilitate a robust and efficient solution in reaching a user's goals. A song-on-demand task, with a total of 38 117 songs and 12 attributes corresponding to each song, is used to test the performance of the proposed approach. In an ideal simulation, assuming no errors, the EMDM strategy is the most efficient goal-seeking method among all tested approaches, returning the correct song within 3.3 dialog turns on average. Furthermore, in a practical scenario, with top five candidates to handle the unavoidable automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) errors, the results show that only 61.7% of the dialog goals can be successfully obtained in 6.23 dialog turns on average when random questions are asked by the system, whereas if the proposed DS-states are updated with the top five candidates from the SLU output using the proposed EMDM strategy executed at every DS-state, then a 86.7% dialog success rate can be accomplished effectively within 5.17 dialog turns on average. We also demonstrate that entropy-based DM strategies are more efficient than non-entropy based DM. Moreover, using the goal set distributions in EMDM, the results are better than those without them, such as in sate-of-the-art database summary DM."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3836","fieldValue":"A probabilistic framework for representing dialog systems and entropy-based dialog management through dynamic stochastic state evolution"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3837","fieldValue":" A low-dimensional representation of a speech segment, the so-called i-vector, in combination with probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) models, is the current state-of-the-art in speaker recognition. An i-vector is a compact representation of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) supervector, which captures most of the GMM supervectors variability. It is usually obtained by a MAP estimate of the mean of a posterior distribution. A new PLDA model has been recently presented that, unlike the standard one, exploits the intrinsic i-vector uncertainty. This approach, referred to in this paper as Full Posterior Distribution PLDA (FP-PLDA), is particularly effective for speaker detection of short and variable duration speech segments. It is, however, computationally far more expensive than standard PLDA, making it unattractive for real applications. This paper presents three simplifications of FP-PLDA based on approximate diagonalizations of matrices involved in FP-PLDA scoring. Using in sequence these approximations allows obtaining computational costs comparable to PLDA models, with only a small performance degradation with respect to the more accurate, but less efficient, FP-PLDA models. In particular, up to 10% better performance than PLDA is obtained, with similar computational complexity, on short speech segments of variable duration, randomly extracted from the interviews and telephone conversations included in the NIST SRE 2010 extended dataset. The benefits of the proposed diagonalization approaches have also been confirmed on a short utterance text-independent verification task, where approximately 43% and 34% improvement of the EER and minimum DCF08, respectively, has been obtained with respect to PLDA."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3837","fieldValue":"ACM"}
