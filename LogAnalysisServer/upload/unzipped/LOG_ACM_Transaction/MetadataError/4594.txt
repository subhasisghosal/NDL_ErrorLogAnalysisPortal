The concept of hybrid flow systems provides a generalization of the conventional concept of hybrid system and it can represent a whole plethora of systems, namely: discrete event systems, multicomponent and multirate numerical methods, multirate and multicomponent sampling systems, event locators and time-varying systems. The ability to join all these types of models makes HFSS an excellent framework for merging components built in different paradigms. We present several examples of model definition in the HFSS formalism and we also exploit the ability of the HFSS formalism to represent mutirate numerical integrators."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24876","fieldValue":" The NORTA method is a fast general-purpose method for generating samples of a random vector with given marginal distributions and given correlation matrix. It is known that there exist marginal distributions and correlation matrices that the NORTA method cannot match, even though a random vector with the prescribed qualities exists. We investigate this problem as the dimension of the random vector increases. Simulation results show that the problem rapidly becomes acute, in the sense that NORTA fails to work with an increasingly large proportion of correlation matrices. Simulation results also show that if one is willing to settle for a correlation matrix that is \"close\" to the desired one, then NORTA performs well with increasing dimension. As part of our analysis, we develop a method for sampling correlation matrices uniformly (in a certain precise sense) from the set of all such matrices. This procedure can be used more generally for sampling uniformly from the space of all symmetric positive definite matrices with diagonal elements fixed at positive values."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24877","fieldValue":"LEcuyer, Pierre"}
