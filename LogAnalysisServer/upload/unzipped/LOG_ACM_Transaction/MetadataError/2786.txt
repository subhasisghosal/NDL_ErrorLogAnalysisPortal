This article presents an HMM\/N-gram-based retrieval approach for Mandarin spoken documents. The underlying characteristics and the various structures of this approach were extensively investigated and analyzed. The retrieval capabilities were verified by tests with word- and syllable-level indexing features and comparisons to the conventional vector-space model approach. To further improve the discrimination capabilities of the HMMs, both the expectation-maximization (EM) and minimum classification error (MCE) training algorithms were introduced in training. Fusion of information via indexing word- and syllable-level features was also investigated. The spoken document retrieval experiments were performed on the Topic Detection and Tracking Corpora (TDT-2 and TDT-3). Very encouraging retrieval performance was obtained."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19222","fieldValue":" Multi-adaptive Galerkin methods are extensions of the standard continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods for the numerical solution of initial value problems for ordinary or partial differential equations. In particular, the multi-adaptive methods allow individual and adaptive time steps to be used for different components or in different regions of space. We present algorithms for efficient multi-adaptive time-stepping, including the recursive construction of time slabs and adaptive time step selection. We also present data structures for efficient storage and interpolation of the multi-adaptive solution. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms and data structures is demonstrated for a series of benchmark problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19222","fieldValue":"C++"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19222","fieldValue":"DOLFIN"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19222","fieldValue":"ODE"}
