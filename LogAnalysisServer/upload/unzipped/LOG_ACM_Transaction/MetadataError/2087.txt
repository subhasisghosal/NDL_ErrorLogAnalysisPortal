{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17068","fieldValue":" We present an algorithm for mapping a triangle mesh, which is homeomorphic to a disk, to a planar domain with arbitrary fixed boundaries. The algorithm is guaranteed to produce a globally bijective map when the boundary is fixed to a shape that does not self-intersect. Obtaining a one-to-one map is of paramount importance for many graphics applications such as texture mapping. However, for other applications, such as quadrangulation, remeshing, and planar deformations, global bijectively may be unnecessarily constraining and requires significant increase on map distortion. For that reason, our algorithm allows the fixed boundary to intersect itself, and is guaranteed to produce a map that is injective locally (if such a map exists). We also extend the basic ideas of the algorithm to support the computation of discrete approximation for extremal quasiconformal maps. The algorithm is conceptually simple and fast. We demonstrate the superior robustness of our algorithm in various settings and configurations in which state-of-the-art algorithms fail to produce injective maps."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17068","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17068","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17069","fieldValue":" The problem of planar mapping and deformation is central in computer graphics. This paper presents a framework for adapting general, smooth, function bases for building provably good planar mappings. The term \"good\" in this context means the map has no fold-overs (injective), is smooth, and has low isometric or conformal distortion. Existing methods that use mesh-based schemes are able to achieve injectivity and\/or control distortion, but fail to create smooth mappings, unless they use a prohibitively large number of elements, which slows them down. Meshless methods are usually smooth by construction, yet they are not able to avoid fold-overs and\/or control distortion. Our approach constrains the linear deformation spaces induced by popular smooth basis functions, such as B-Splines, Gaussian and Thin-Plate Splines, at a set of collocation points, using specially tailored convex constraints that prevent fold-overs and high distortion at these points. Our analysis then provides the required density of collocation points and\/or constraint type, which guarantees that the map is injective and meets the distortion constraints over the entire domain of interest. We demonstrate that our method is interactive at reasonably complicated settings and compares favorably to other state-of-the-art mesh and meshless planar deformation methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17069","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17069","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17070","fieldValue":"Sorkine-Hornung, Alexander"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17070","fieldValue":" Aligning video is a fundamental task in computer graphics and vision, required for a wide range of applications. We present an interactive method for computing optimal nonlinear temporal video alignments of an arbitrary number of videos. We first derive a robust approximation of alignment quality between pairs of clips, computed as a weighted histogram of feature matches. We then find optimal temporal mappings (constituting frame correspondences) using a graph-based approach that allows for very efficient evaluation with artist constraints. This enables an enhancement to the \"snapping\" interface in video editing tools, where videos in a time-line are now able snap to one another when dragged by an artist based on their content, rather than simply start-and-end times. The pairwise snapping is then generalized to multiple clips, achieving a globally optimal temporal synchronization that automatically arranges a series of clips filmed at different times into a single consistent time frame. When followed by a simple spatial registration, we achieve high quality spatiotemporal video alignments at a fraction of the computational complexity compared to previous methods. Assisted temporal alignment is a degree of freedom that has been largely unexplored, but is an important task in video editing. Our approach is simple to implement, highly efficient, and very robust to differences in video content, allowing for interactive exploration of the temporal alignment space for multiple real world HD videos."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17070","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17070","fieldValue":"ACM"}
