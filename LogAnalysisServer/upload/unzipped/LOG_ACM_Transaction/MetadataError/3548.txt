It is shown that the tracking accuracy is approximately proportional to the number of active sensor nodes participating in collaborative tracking. Excessive sensor nodes thus may be put to sleep mode to conserve energy provided there are a sufficient number of active sensor nodes. It is then shown that the lifespan of a WSN is dictated by the distribution of residue energy of sensor nodes. Specifically, we have shown that an energy-balanced WSN is likely to maximize its lifespan. As such, at each step of the tracking task, the head node must judiciously select active nodes from all sensors within the sensing range to minimize residue energy variations (energy balanced) while achieving desired tracking accuracy. This is formulated as a subset selection problem, which is shown to have a complexity that is NP-hard. Several energy-balanced scheduling for tracking (EBaST) heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve this problem with polynomial execution complexities. Extensive simulations have been conducted to compare EBaST against some state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms. It is observed that EBaST is more capable of significantly extending the WSNs lifespan than competing algorithms while delivering comparable or better tracking accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21539","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21539","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21540","fieldValue":" Recent advances in Microelectronic Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and wireless communication technologies have fostered the rapid development of networked embedded systems like wireless sensor networks. System software for these self-organizing systems often needs to be updated for a variety of reasons. We present a holistic software update (i.e., reprogramming) system called R3 for networked embedded systems. R3 has two salient features. First, the binary differencing algorithm within R3 (R3diff) ensures an optimal result in terms of the delta size under a configurable cost measure. Second, the similarity preserving method within R3 (R3sim) optimizes the binary code format for achieving a large similarity with a small metadata overhead. Overall, R3 achieves the smallest delta size compared with other software update approaches such as Stream, Rsync, RMTD, Zephyr, Hermes, and R2 (e.g., 50&percnt;--99&percnt; reduction compared to Stream and about 20&percnt;--40&percnt; reduction compared to R2). R3â\u20AC™s implementation on TelosB\/TinyOS is lightweight and efficient.

While managing power requires understanding the amount of energy harvestable from the local environment, current solar prediction methods rely only on recent local history, which makes them susceptible to high variability. In this article, we present a model and algorithms for distributed solar current prediction based on multiple linear regression to predict future solar current based on local, in situ climatic and solar measurements. These algorithms leverage spatial information from neighbors and adapt to the changing local conditions not captured by global climatic information. We implement these algorithms on our Fleck platform and run a 7-week-long experiment validating our work. In analyzing our results from this experiment, we determined that computing our model requires an increased energy expenditure of 4.5mJ over simpler models (on the order of $10^-7$&percnt; of the harvested energy) to gain a prediction improvement of 39.7&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21541","fieldValue":"ACM"}
