Modeling of the natural generated ionic currents on the human pancreatic Î²-cell activity had been already studied using complicated analytical models. In our present contribution, we prove the same using our simple electrical model. The ionic currents are associated with different proteins membrane channels (K-Ca, Kv, KATP, Cav-L) and Na\/Ca Exchanger (NCX). The proteins are Ohmic conductors and are modeled by conductance randomly distributed. Switches are placed in series with conductances in order to highlight the channel activity. However, the KATP channel activity is stimulated by glucose, and the NCX's conductance change according to the intracellular calcium concentration. The percolation threshold of the system is calculated by the fractal nature of the infinite cluster using the Tarjan's depth-first-search algorithm. It is shown that the behavior of the internal concentration of $Ca^2+ and the membrane potential are modulated by glucose. The results confirm that the inhibition of KATP channels depolarizes the membrane and increases the influx of [Ca2+$]i through NCX and Cav-L channel for high glucose concentrations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5292","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5292","fieldValue":"Fractal behavior of the pancreatic Î²-cell near the percolation threshold: effect of the KATP channel on the electrical response"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5293","fieldValue":" Computational methods to engineer cellular metabolism promise to play a critical role in producing pharmaceutical, repairing defective genes, destroying cancer cells, and generating biofuels. Elementary Flux Mode (EFM) analysis is one such powerful technique that has elucidated cell growth and regulation, predicted product yield, and analyzed network robustness. EFM analysis, however, is a computationally daunting task because it requires the enumeration of all independent and stoichiometrically balanced pathways within a cellular network. We present in this paper an EFM enumeration algorithm, termed graphical EFM or gEFM. The algorithm is based on graph traversal, an approach previously assumed unsuitable for enumerating EFMs. The approach is derived from a pathway synthesis method proposed by Mavrovouniotis et al. The algorithm is described and proved correct. We apply gEFM to several networks and report runtimes in comparison with other EFM computation tools. We show how gEFM benefits from network compression. Like other EFM computational techniques, gEFM is sensitive to constraint ordering; however, we are able to demonstrate that knowledge of the underlying network structure leads to better constraint ordering. gEFM is shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art EFM computational techniques for several networks, but less so for networks with a larger number of EFMs."}
