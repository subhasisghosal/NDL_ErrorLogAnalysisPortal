Unfortunately, many algorithms with parameters derived from sensing the physical world suffer large variations in execution time, leading to pessimistic overall utilization, such as visual recognition tasks. In this article, we present ZS-QRAM, a scheduling approach that enables the use of flexible execution times and application-derived utility to tasks in order to maximize total system utility. In particular, we provide a detailed description of the algorithm, the formal proofs for its temporal protection, and a detailed, evaluation. Our evaluation uses the Utility Degradation Resilience (UDR) showing that ZS-QRAM is able to obtain 4Ã\u2014 as much UDR as ZSRM, a previous overbooking approach, and almost 2Ã\u2014 as much UDR as Rate-Monotonic with Period Transformation (RM\/TP). We then evaluate a Linux kernel module implementation of our scheduler on an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) platform. We show that, by using our approach, we are able to keep the tasks that render the most utility by degrading lower-utility ones even in the presence of highly dynamic execution times."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6877","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6877","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6878","fieldValue":"Lee, Victor C S"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6878","fieldValue":"Ng, Joseph K Y"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6878","fieldValue":"Sha, Edwin H-M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6878","fieldValue":" Timely and efficient data dissemination is one of the fundamental requirements to enable innovative applications in vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPS). In this work, we intensively analyze the characteristics of temporal data dissemination in VCPS. On this basis, we formulate the static and dynamic snapshot consistency requirements on serving real-time requests for temporal data items. Two online algorithms are proposed to enhance the system performance with different requirements. In particular, a reschedule mechanism is developed to make the scheduling adaptable to the dynamic snapshot consistency requirement. A comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithms."}
