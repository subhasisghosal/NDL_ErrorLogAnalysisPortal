The decoupling is designed to overcome the following drawbacks of traditional solutions:(1) multiple postings in disjoint space decomposition methods that lead to balanced trees such as the hB-tree where a node split in the event of node overflow may be such that one of the children of the node that was split becomes a child of both of the nodes resulting from the split;(2) multiple coverage and nondisjointness of methods based on object hierarchies such as the R-tree which lead to nonunique search paths;(3) directory nodes with similarly-shaped hyper-rectangle bounding boxes with minimum occupancy in disjoint space decomposition methods such as those based on quadtrees and k-d trees that make use of regular decomposition.The first two drawbacks are shown to be overcome by the BV-tree where as a result of decoupling the partitioning and grouping processes, the union of the regions associated with the nodes at a given level of the directory does not necessarily contain all of the data points although all searches take the same amount of time. The BV-tree is not plagued by the third drawback. The third drawback is shown to be overcome by the PK-tree where the grouping process is based on ensuring that every node has at least k objects or blocks. The PK-tree is not plagued by the first two drawbacks as they are inapplicable to it. In both cases, the downside of decoupling the partitioning and grouping processes is that the resulting structure is not necessarily balanced, although, since the nodes have a relatively large fanout, the deviation from a balanced structure is relatively small."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14333","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14333","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14334","fieldValue":"zsoyolu, Gltekin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14334","fieldValue":"Al-Hamdani, Abdullah"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14334","fieldValue":"zel, Selma Aye"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14334","fieldValue":"Ulusoy, zgr"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14334","fieldValue":"zsoyolu, Zehra Meral"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14334","fieldValue":" In this article, we discuss the issues involved in adding a native score management system to object-relational databases, to be used in querying Web metadata (that describes the semantic content of Web resources). The Web metadata model is based on topics (representing entities), relationships among topics (called metalinks), and importance scores (sideway values) of topics and metalinks. We extend database relations with scoring functions and importance scores. We add to SQL score-management clauses with well-defined semantics, and propose the sideway-value algebra (SVA), to evaluate the extended SQL queries. SQL extensions and the SVA algebra are illustrated through two Web resources, namely, the DBLP Bibliography and the SIGMOD Anthology.SQL extensions include clauses for propagating input tuple importance scores to output tuples during query processing, clauses that specify query stopping conditions, threshold predicates (a type of approximate similarity predicates for text comparisons), and user-defined-function-based predicates. The propagated importance scores are then used to rank and return a small number of output tuples. The query stopping conditions are propagated to SVA operators during query processing. We show that our SQL extensions are well-defined, meaning that, given a database and a query Q, under any query processing scheme, the output tuples of Q and their importance scores stay the same.To process the SQL extensions, we discuss two sideway value algebra operators, namely, sideway value algebra join and topic closure, give their implementation algorithms, and report their experimental evaluations."}
