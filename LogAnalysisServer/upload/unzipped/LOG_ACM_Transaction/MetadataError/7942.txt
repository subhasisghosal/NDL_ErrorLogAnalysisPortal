{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10701","fieldValue":" More and more wireless networks are deployed with overlapping coverage. Especially in the unlicensed bands, we see an increasing density of heterogeneous solutions, with very diverse technologies and application requirements. As a consequence, interference from heterogeneous sources--also called cross-technology interference--is a major problem causing an increase of packet error rate (PER) and decrease of quality of service (QoS), possibly leading to application failure. This issue is apparent, for example, when an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor network coexists with an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN, which is the focus of this work. One way to alleviate cross-technology interference is to avoid it in the frequency domain by selecting different channels. Different multichannel protocols suitable for frequency-domain interference avoidance have already been proposed in the literature. However, most of these protocols have only been investigated from the perspective of intratechnology interference. Within this work, we create an objective comparison of different candidate channel selection mechanisms based on a new multichannel protocol taxonomy using measurements in a real-life testbed. We assess different metrics for the most suitable mechanism using the same set of measurements as in the comparison study. Finally, we verify the operation of the best channel selection metric in a proof-of-concept implementation running on the testbed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10701","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10701","fieldValue":"MAC"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10701","fieldValue":"RDT"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10701","fieldValue":"Analysis and experimental verification of frequency-based interference avoidance mechanisms in IEEE 802.15.4"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10701","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10701","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10702","fieldValue":" TV Whitespaces, recently opened up by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for unlicensed use, are seen as a potential cellular offload and\/or standalone mechanism, especially in dense metros where the demand for throughput is high. In this paper, we use real data collected from whitespaces databases to empirically demonstrate features unique to whitespaces-- power-spectrum tradeoff and spatial variation in spectrum availability. From this study, we conclude the need for whitespaces-specific adaptations to cellular networks so as to be able to extract maximum throughput and guarantee reliability. To tackle the effects of the power-spectrum tradeoff, we propose a novel base-station design that specifically uses low-power transmitters as a means to maximize throughput. This design co-locates and networks together many low-powered mode-I devices to act as a multiple-antenna array. We estimate the size of the array required to meet typical rate targets, and show that the array design significantly outperforms traditional designs in terms of throughput for a given cost. We then turn our attention to spatial variability and study its impact on the problem of locating base stations in a whitespaces network. Here, we propose spectrum-aware placement algorithms for whitespaces, which account for this spatial variability along with key parameters like user density. We show that such algorithms clearly outperform traditional placement algorithms and improve network coverage in this band"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10702","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10702","fieldValue":"ACM"}
