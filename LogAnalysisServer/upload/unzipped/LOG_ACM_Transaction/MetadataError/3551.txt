{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21547","fieldValue":" A key distribution scheme for wireless sensor networks based on a system of dynamic, pairwise keys is considered. In the scheme, each pair of communicating nodes shares pairwise symmetric keys and changes them at every transmission using a set of hashing functions. This article examines security aspects of the protocol. The most important issue is to ensure that it is infeasible for an adversary to restrict exhaustive key search to a subset of the keyspace. This desirable property holds if, after a small number of random key transitions, the distribution of keys among the nodes is close to uniform. The article provides a rigorous mathematical analysis of the distribution of keys and supplements it with experimental results. The problem is reduced to the question of determining mixing time and the stationary distribution of a random walk on a random digraph. It is shown that with probability close to 1, the mixing time is of small order and the fluctuations of the distribution are limited. This ensures the ongoing security of the protocol by making the communications forward secure and protecting against node compromise."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21547","fieldValue":"Mixing in Random Digraphs with Application to the Forward-Secure Key Evolution in Wireless Sensor Networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21548","fieldValue":" Data centers have become a critical computing infrastructure in the era of cloud computing. Temperature monitoring and forecasting are essential for preventing server shutdowns because of overheating and improving a data centerâ\u20AC™s energy efficiency. This article presents a novel cyber-physical approach for temperature forecasting in data centers, one that integrates Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, in situ wireless sensing, and real-time data-driven prediction. To ensure forecasting fidelity, we leverage the realistic physical thermodynamic models of CFD to generate transient temperature distribution and calibrate it using sensor feedback. Both simulated temperature distribution and sensor measurements are then used to train a real-time prediction algorithm. As a result, our approach reduces not only the computational complexity of online temperature modeling and prediction, but also the number of deployed sensors, which enables a portable, noninvasive thermal monitoring solution that does not rely on the infrastructure of a monitored data center. We extensively evaluated the proposed system on a rack of 15 servers and a testbed of five racks and 229 servers in a small-scale production data center. Our results show that our system can predict the temperature evolution of servers with highly dynamic workloads at an average error of 0.52&cir;C, within a duration up to 10 minutes. Moreover, our approach can reduce the required number of sensors by 67&percnt; while maintaining desirable prediction fidelity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21548","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21548","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21549","fieldValue":"Chou, Pai H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21549","fieldValue":" We consider the goal of adaptively controlling access to medium in wireless sensor networks with minimal footprint and complexity. Lightweight protocols are desirable in general and inevitable in some real-world applications such as infant monitoring. We assume high-data-rate, resource-constrained wireless sensor nodes in a star network. We take a deterministic approach to contention resolution to achieve bounded latency on data transmissions while reducing the overhead. In addition to simplicity and small footprint, our approach requires fewer message exchanges compared to the state of the art. We then present a lightweight hybrid protocol that is seamlessly integrated with the proposed contention-resolution scheme, one better suited for delay-sensitive applications with real-time constraints by providing determinism. Another feature of the proposed protocol is that it requires carrier-sensing hardware only on the base station but not on the sensor nodes. The average probing complexity of our protocol in a highly dynamic network is O(n\/log n) per round, and experimental results show the proposed scheme to be scalable and highly adaptive to the contention level."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21549","fieldValue":"ACM"}
