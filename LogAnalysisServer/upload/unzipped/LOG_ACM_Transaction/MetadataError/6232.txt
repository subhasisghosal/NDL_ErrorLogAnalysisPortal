We define a multiagent embedded architecture in which a Reconfiguration Agent is affected to each device of the execution environment to apply local reconfigurations, and a Coordination Agent is proposed for coordination between devices in order to guarantee safe and coherent distributed reconfigurations. A Communication Protocol is proposed to handle such coordination by using well-defined Coordination Matrices. A prototype is developed to simulate the whole architecture when faults occur or systemâ\u20AC™s optimizations are applied. We specify Reconfiguration Agents to be modeled by nested state machines, and the Coordination Agent according to the formalism Net Condition\/Event Systems (Abbreviated by NCES) which is an extension of Petri nets. To allow correct and coherent distributed reconfigurations, we check all possible interactions between controllers by verifying that whenever a reconfiguration is applied in a device, the Coordination Agent and other concerned devices react as described in user requirements. We propose finally XML-based implementations of both Coordination and Reconfiguration Agents according the the technology IEC61499. The articleâ\u20AC™s contributions are applied to two Benchmark Production Systems available in our research laboratory."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6614","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6614","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6614","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6146","fieldValue":"Issue 2(Special issue on embedded systems for interactive multimedia services (ES-IMS)), February 2013"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6615","fieldValue":"Leung, Victor CM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6615","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6615","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6616","fieldValue":"Chen, Yeong-Sheng"}
