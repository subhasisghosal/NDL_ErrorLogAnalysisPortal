The proposed frequency-domain adaptive line enhancer is used as a single-channel noise reduction system for removing harmonic noise from noisy speech. Our main contribution is to exploit the temporal dependence in the log-magnitude and phase spectra of the noisy speech using mutual information, and to derive a frequency-dependent step-size which detects the presence of harmonic noise in different frequency bins. Our proposed step-size control allows the suppression of harmonic noise and the preservation of speech components. The experiments are performed with different real-life acoustic noises which contain harmonic components. Using instrumental speech intelligibility and quality measures, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform the conventional frequency-domain adaptive line enhancer with a fixed step-size for harmonic noise reduction."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4049","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4049","fieldValue":"A frequency-domain adaptive line enhancer with step-size control based on mutual information for harmonic noise reduction"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4049","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4049","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4050","fieldValue":" Active noise control algorithms without secondary path modeling are very appealing because they can effectively overcome the problems caused by imperfect secondary path model. For broadband noise control, subband structures have been adopted in these kinds of algorithms, where the full-band adaptive filter coefficients are obtained from subband filter coefficients with weight transformation. However, the usually used two-direction search method suffers from slow convergence if the secondary path phase is close to± 90° To deal with this problem, a four-direction search method has been proposed in frequency domain, which is sometimes too complicated for practical applications. In this paper, a simplified algorithm is proposed to reduce the implementation complexity. In the proposed algorithm, the delay of the secondary path is estimated first, and then the estimated delay is used in the delay compensation to reduce the number of subbands. Two reference signals are generated in each subband and two update directions are used. Only one subband reference signal and one update direction are selected to approximate the phase response of the residual secondary path, and then the full-band adaptive controller coefficients are adjusted directly in time domain with them without the need of further weight transformation. Just like those existing subband algorithms, the simplified algorithm can obtain similar steady-state noise reduction performance as that of the FxLMS algorithm but without secondary path modeling. Simulations and experiments are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4050","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}
