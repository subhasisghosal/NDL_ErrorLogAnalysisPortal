Since memory requirements are proportional to the product of domain dimensions, simulation performance is limited by memory access, as solvers for elliptic problems are not compute-bound on modern systems. This is a significant concern for large-scale scenes. To reduce the memory footprint and memory\/compute ratio, vortex singularity bases can be used. Though they form a compact bases for incompressible vector fields, robust and efficient modeling of nonrigid obstacles and free-surfaces can be challenging with these methods. We propose a hybrid domain decomposition approach that couples Eulerian velocity-based simulations with vortex singularity simulations. Our formulation reduces memory footprint by using smaller Eulerian domains with compact vortex bases, thereby improving the memory\/compute ratio, and simulation performance by more than 1000x for single phase flows as well as significant improvements for free-surface scenes. Coupling these two heterogeneous methods also affords flexibility in using the most appropriate method for modeling different scene features, as well as allowing robust interaction of vortex methods with free-surfaces and nonrigid obstacles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16738","fieldValue":" Simulating solid-fluid coupling with the classical meshless methods is an difficult issue due to the lack of the Kronecker delta property of the shape functions when enforcing the essential boundary conditions. In this work, we present a novel staggered meshless method to overcome this problem. We create a set of staggered particles from the original particles in each time step by mapping the mass and momentum onto these staggered particles, aiming to stagger the velocity field from the pressure field. Based on this arrangement, an new approximate projection method is proposed to enforce divergence-free on the fluid velocity with compatible boundary conditions. In the simulations, the method handles the fluid and solid in a unified meshless manner and generalizes the formulations for computing the viscous and pressure forces. To enhance the robustness of the algorithm, we further propose a new framework to handle the degeneration case in the solid-fluid coupling, which guarantees stability of the simulation. The proposed method offers the benefit that various slip boundary conditions can be easily implemented. Besides, explicit collision handling for the fluid and solid is avoided. The method is easy to implement and can be extended from the standard SPH algorithm in a straightforward manner. The paper also illustrates both one-way and two-way couplings of the fluids and rigid bodies using several test cases in two and three dimensions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16739","fieldValue":"Hsu, Shu-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16739","fieldValue":" We present a simulation control to support art-directable stacking designs by automatically adding constraints to stabilize the stacking structure. We begin by adapting equilibrium analysis in a local scheme to find \"stable\" objects of the stacking structure. Next, for stabilizing the structure, we pick suitable objects from those passing the equilibrium analysis and then restrict their DOFs by managing the insertion of constraints on them. The method is suitable for controlling stacking behavior of large scale. Results show that our control method can be used in varied ways for creating plausible animation. In addition, the method can be easily implemented as a plug-in into existing simulation solvers without changing the fundamental operations of the solvers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16739","fieldValue":"ACM"}
