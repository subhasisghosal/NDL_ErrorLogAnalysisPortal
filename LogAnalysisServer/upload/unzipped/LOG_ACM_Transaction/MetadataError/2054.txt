In addition to retaining many desired properties of SGs, ASGs are also rotationally invariant and capable of representing all-frequency signals. To further strengthen the properties of ASGs, we have derived approximate closed-form solutions for their integral, product and convolution operators, whose errors are nearly negligible, as validated by quantitative analysis. Supported by all these operators, ASGs can be adapted in existing SG-based applications to enhance their scalability in handling anisotropic effects. To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of ASGs in practice, we have applied ASGs in two important SG-based rendering applications and the experimental results clearly reveal the merits of ASGs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16991","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present a GPU-based out-of-core rendering approach under the many-lights rendering framework. Many-lights rendering is an efficient and scalable rendering framework for a large number of lights. But when the data sizes of lights and geometry are both beyond the in-core memory storage size, the data management of these two out-of-core data becomes critical and challenging. In our approach, we formulate such a data management as a graph traversal optimization problem that first builds out-of-core lights and geometry data into a graph, and then guides shading computations by finding a shortest path to visit all vertices in the graph. Based on the proposed data management, we develop a GPU-based out-of-GPU-core rendering algorithm that manages data between the CPU host memory and the GPU device memory. Two main steps are taken in the algorithm: the out-of-core data preparation to pack data into optimal data layouts for the many-lights rendering, and the out-of-core shading using graph-based data management. We demonstrate our algorithm on scenes with out-of-core detailed geometry and out-of-core lights. Results show that our approach generates complex global illumination effects with increased data access coherence and has one order of magnitude performance gain over the CPU-based approach."}
