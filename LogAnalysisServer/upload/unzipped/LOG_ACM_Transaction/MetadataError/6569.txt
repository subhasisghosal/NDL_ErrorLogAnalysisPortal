{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1682","fieldValue":" The register file is one of the most critical datapath components limiting the number of threads that can be supported on a simultaneous multithreading (SMT) processor. To allow the use of smaller register files without degrading performance, techniques that maximize the efficiency of using registers through aggressive register allocation\/deallocation can be considered. In this article, we propose a novel technique to early deallocate physical registers allocated to threads which experience L2 cache misses. This is accomplished by speculatively committing the load-independent instructions and deallocating the registers corresponding to the previous mappings of their destinations, without waiting for the cache miss request to be serviced. The early deallocated registers are then made immediately available for allocation to instructions within the same thread as well as within other threads, thus improving the overall processor throughput. On the average across the simulated mixes of multiprogrammed SPEC 2000 workloads, our technique results in 33&percnt; improvement in throughput and 25&percnt; improvement in terms of harmonic mean of weighted IPCs over the baseline SMT with the state-of-the-art DCRA policy. This is achieved without creating checkpoints, maintaining per-register counters of pending consumers, performing tag rebroadcasts, register remappings, and\/or additional associative searches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1682","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1682","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7505","fieldValue":" We study the problem of learning classification models from complex multivariate temporal data encountered in electronic health record systems. The challenge is to define a good set of features that are able to represent well the temporal aspect of the data. Our method relies on temporal abstractions and temporal pattern mining to extract the classification features. Temporal pattern mining usually returns a large number of temporal patterns, most of which may be irrelevant to the classification task. To address this problem, we present the Minimal Predictive Temporal Patterns framework to generate a small set of predictive and nonspurious patterns. We apply our approach to the real-world clinical task of predicting patients who are at risk of developing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The results demonstrate the benefit of our approach in efficiently learning accurate classifiers, which is a key step for developing intelligent clinical monitoring systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7506","fieldValue":" The increasing aging population in the coming decades will result in many complications for society and in particular for the healthcare system due to the shortage of healthcare professionals and healthcare facilities. To remedy this problem, researchers have pursued developing remote monitoring systems and assisted living technologies by utilizing recent advances in sensor and networking technology, as well as in the data mining and machine learning fields. In this article, we report on our fully automated approach for discovering and monitoring patterns of daily activities. Discovering and tracking patterns of daily activities can provide unprecedented opportunities for health monitoring and assisted living applications, especially for older adults and individuals with mental disabilities. Previous approaches usually rely on preselected activities or labeled data to track and monitor daily activities. In this article, we present a fully automated approach by discovering natural activity patterns and their variations in real-life data. We will show how our activity discovery component can be integrated with an activity recognition component to track and monitor various daily activity patterns. We also provide an activity visualization component to allow caregivers to visually observe and examine the activity patterns using a user-friendly interface. We validate our algorithms using real-life data obtained from two apartments during a three-month period."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7506","fieldValue":"COM: A method for mining and monitoring human activity patterns in home-based health monitoring systems"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7506","fieldValue":"ACM"}
