Our test set comprises problems in linear systems, least squares, and eigenvalue calculations from a wide variety of scientific and engineering disciplines. The problems range from small matrices, used as counter-examples to hypotheses in sparse matrix research, to large test cases arising in large-scale computation. We offer the collection to other researchers as a standard benchmark for comparative studies of algorithms. The procedures for obtaining and using the test collection are discussed. We also describe the guidelines for contributing further test problems to the collection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18601","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18601","fieldValue":"ACM"}
