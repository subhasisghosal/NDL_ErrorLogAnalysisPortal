{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25361","fieldValue":" Three-dimensional tele-immersive (3DTI) environments have great potential to promote collaborative work among geographically distributed users. However, most existing 3DTI systems only work with two sites due to the huge demand of resources and the lack of a simple yet powerful networking model to handle connectivity, scalability, and quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. In this article, we explore the design space from the angle of multi-stream management to enable multi-party 3DTI communication. Multiple correlated 3D video streams are employed to provide a comprehensive representation of the physical scene in each 3DTI environment, and are rendered together to establish a common cyberspace among all participating 3DTI environments. The existence of multi-stream correlation provides the unique opportunity for new approaches in QoS provisioning. Previous work mostly concentrated on compression and adaptation techniques on the per-stream basis while ignoring the application layer semantics and the coordination required among streams. We propose an innovative and generalized ViewCast model to coordinate the multi-stream content dissemination over an overlay network. ViewCast leverages view semantics in 3D free-viewpoint video systems to fill the gap between high-level user interest and low-level stream management. In ViewCast, only the view information is specified by the user\/application, while the underlying control dynamically performs stream differentiation, selection, coordination, and dissemination. We present the details of ViewCast and evaluate it through both simulation and 3DTI sessions among tele-immersive environments residing in different institutes across the Internet2. Our experimental results demonstrate the implementation feasibility and performance enhancement of ViewCast in supporting multi-party 3DTI collaboration."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3449","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3449","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25362","fieldValue":" This study is to investigate the fundamental problems of, (1) facial feature detection and localization, especially eye features; and (2) eye dynamics, including tracking and blink detection. We first describe our contribution to eye localization. Following that, we discuss a simultaneous eye tracking and blink detection system. Facial feature detection is solved in a general object detection framework and its performance for eye localization is presented. A binary tree representation based on feature dependency partitions the object feature space in a coarse to fine manner. In each compact feature subspace, independent component analysis (ICA) is used to get the independent sources, whose probability density functions (PDFs) are modeled by Gaussian mixtures. When applying this representation for the task of eye detection, a subwindow is used to scan the entire image and each obtained image patch is examined using Bayesian criteria to determine the presence of an eye subject. After the eyes are automatically located with binary tree-based probability learning, interactive particle filters are used for simultaneously tracking the eyes and detecting the blinks. The particle filters use classification-based observation models, in which the posterior probabilities are evaluated by logistic regressions in tensor subspaces. Extensive experiments are used to evaluate the performance from two aspects, (1) blink detection rate and the accuracy of blink duration in terms of the frame numbers; (2) eye tracking accuracy. We also present an experimental setup for obtaining the benchmark data in tracking accuracy evaluation. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the capability of this approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25363","fieldValue":"Chan, S-H Gary"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25363","fieldValue":" Current peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming systems often assume that nodes cooperate to upload and download data. However, in the open environment of the Internet, this is not necessarily true and there exist malicious nodes in the system. In this article, we study malicious actions of nodes that can be detected through peer-based monitoring. We require each node to monitor the data received and to periodically send monitoring messages about its neighbors to some trustworthy nodes. To efficiently store and search messages among multiple trustworthy nodes, we organize trustworthy nodes into a threaded binary tree. Trustworthy nodes also dynamically redistribute monitoring messages among themselves to achieve load balancing. Our simulation results show that this scheme can efficiently detect malicious nodes with high accuracy, and that the dynamic redistribution method can achieve good load balancing among trustworthy nodes."}
