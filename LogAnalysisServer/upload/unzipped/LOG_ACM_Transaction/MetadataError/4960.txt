However, when applying text-based techniques on spoken content, the inevitable recognition errors seriously degrade performance even when the retrieval process is performed over lattices. We propose the estimation of more accurate term distributions (or unigram language models) for the spoken documents by acoustic similarity graphs. In this approach, a graph is constructed for each term describing the acoustic similarity among all signal regions hypothesized to be the considered term. Score propagation based on a random walk over the graph offers more reliable scores of the term hypotheses, which in turn yield more accurate term distributions (or unigram language models). This approach was applied with the language modeling retrieval approach, including using document expansion based on latent topic analysis and query expansion with a query-regularized mixture model. We extend these approaches from words to subword n-grams, and the query expansion from document-level to utterance-level and from term-based to topic-based. Experiments performed on Mandarin broadcast news showed improved performance under almost all tested conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3590","fieldValue":"Improved Semantic Retrieval of Spoken Content by Document\/Query Expansion with Random Walk Over Acoustic Similarity Graphs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3590","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3590","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1270","fieldValue":" In recent years it has become more and more evident that openness and adaptivity are key characteristics of next-generation distributed systems. The reason for this is not least due to the advent of computing trends like ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, and cyber-physical systems, where systems are usually open for dynamic integration and able to react adaptively to changing situations. Despite being open and adaptive, it is a common requirement for such systems to be safe. However, traditional safety assurance techniques, both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art ones, are not sufficient in this context. We have recently developed some initial solution concepts based on conditional safety certificates and corresponding runtime analyses. In this article we show how to operationalize these concepts. To this end, we present in detail how to specify conditional safety certificates, how to transform them into suitable runtime models, and how these models finally support dynamic safety evaluations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1270","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1270","fieldValue":"ACM"}
