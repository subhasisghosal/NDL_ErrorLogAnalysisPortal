{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10541","fieldValue":" Immediate reservation (IR) and advance reservation (AR) are the two main reservation mechanisms currently implemented on large-scale scientific optical networks. They can be used to satisfy both provisioning delay and low blocking for delay-tolerant applications. Therefore, it seems reasonable that future optical network provisioning systems will provide both mechanisms in hybrid IR\/AR scenarios. Nonetheless, such scenarios can increase the blocking of IR if no quality-of-service (QoS) policies are implemented. A solution could be to quantify such blocking performance based on the current network load and implement mechanisms that would act accordingly. However, current blocking analytical models are not able to deal with both IR and AR. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to compute the network-wide blocking performance of different IR\/AR classes within the scope of a multiservice framework for optical wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) networks. Specifically, we calculate the blocking on two common optical network scenarios using the fixed-point approximation analysis: on wavelength conversion capable and wavelength-continuity constrained networks. Performance results show that our model provides good accuracy compared to simulation results, even in a scenario with multiple reservation classes defined by different book-ahead times."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10541","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10541","fieldValue":"Analytical blocking probability model for hybrid immediate and advance reservations in optical WDM networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10541","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10541","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10542","fieldValue":" Supporting massive device transmission is challenging in machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. Particularly, in event-driven M2M communications, a large number of devices become activated within a short period of time, which in turn causes high radio congestions and severe access delay. To address this issue, we propose a Fast Adaptive S-ALOHA (FASA) scheme for random access control of M2M communication systems with bursty traffic. Instead of the observation in a single slot, the statistics of consecutive idle and collision slots are used in FASA to accelerate the tracking process of network status that is critical for optimizing S-ALOHA systems. With a design based on drift analysis, the estimate of the number of the active devices under FASA converges fast to the true value. Furthermore, by examining the T-slot drifts, we prove that the proposed FASA scheme is stable as long as the average arrival rate is smaller than $e^-1$, in the sense that the Markov chain derived from the scheme is geometrically ergodic. Simulation results demonstrate that under highly bursty traffic, the proposed FASA scheme outperforms traditional additive schemes such as PB-ALOHA and achieves near-optimal performance in reducing access delays. Moreover, compared to multiplicative schemes, FASA shows its robustness under heavy traffic load in addition to better delay performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10542","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10542","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10542","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10543","fieldValue":"Li, William Wei-Liang"}
