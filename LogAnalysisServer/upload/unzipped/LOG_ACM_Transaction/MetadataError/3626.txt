Given the intense competition from multicore and GPUs, there is now a question whether MD on HPRC can be competitive. We concentrate here on the MD kernel computation: determining the short-range force between particle pairs. In one part of the study, we systematically explore the design space of the force pipeline with respect to arithmetic algorithm, arithmetic mode, precision, and various other optimizations. We examine simplifications and find that some have little effect on simulation quality. In the other part, we present the first FPGA study of the filtering of particle pairs with nearly zero mutual force, a standard optimization in MD codes. There are several innovations, including a novel partitioning of the particle space, and new methods for filtering and mapping work onto the pipelines. As a consequence, highly efficient filtering can be implemented with only a small fraction of the FPGAâ\u20AC™s resources. Overall, we find that, for an Altera Stratix-III EP3ES260, 8 force pipelines running at nearly 200 MHz can fit on the FPGA, and that they can perform at 95&percnt; efficiency. This results in an 80-fold per core speed-up for the short-range force, which is likely to make FPGAs highly competitive for MD."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21759","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21759","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21760","fieldValue":"Santambrogio, Marco D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21760","fieldValue":" The aim of this article is to describe a complete partitioning and floorplanning algorithm tailored for reconfigurable architectures deployable on FPGAs and considering communication infrastructure feasibility. This article proposes a novel approach for resource- and reconfiguration- aware floorplanning. Different from existing approaches, our floorplanning algorithm takes specific physical constraints such as resource distribution and the granularity of reconfiguration possible for a given FPGA device into account. Due to the introduction of constraints typical of other problems like partitioning and placement, the proposed approach is named floorplacer in order to underline the great differences with respect to traditional floorplanners. These physical constraints are typically considered at the later placement stage. Different aspects of the problems have been described, focusing particularly on the FPGAs resource heterogeneity and the temporal dimension typical of reconfigurable systems. Once the problem is introduced a comparison among related works has been provided and their limits have been pointed out. Experimental results proved the validity of the proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21760","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21760","fieldValue":"ACM"}
