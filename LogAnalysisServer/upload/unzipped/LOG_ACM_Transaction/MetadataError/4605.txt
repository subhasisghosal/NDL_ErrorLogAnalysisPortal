{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24902","fieldValue":" The High Level Architecture (HLA) is an architecture for reuse and interoperation of simulations. It provides several Data Distribution Management (DDM) services to reduce the transmission and reception of irrelevant data. These services rely on the computation of the intersection between \"update\" and \"subscription\" regions. Currently, there are several main DDM filtering algorithms. Since each approach still has some shortcomings, we have focused our research on the design and the evaluation of intersection algorithms for the DDM. In this article, we introduce a new algorithm in which extents are sorted before computing the intersections. Our experiments show that usually the sort-based algorithm has the best performance among all approaches. The improvement of its performance ranges between 30% and 99% over the brute force and hybrid approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24902","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24902","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24903","fieldValue":" We introduce ASAP3, a refinement of the batch means algorithms ASAP and ASAP2, that delivers point and confidence-interval estimators for the expected response of a steady-state simulation. ASAP3 is a sequential procedure designed to produce a confidence-interval estimator that satisfies user-specified requirements on absolute or relative precision as well as coverage probability. ASAP3 operates as follows: the batch size is progressively increased until the batch means pass the Shapiro-Wilk test for multivariate normality; and then ASAP3 fits a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) time series model to the batch means. If necessary, the batch size is further increased until the autoregressive parameter in the AR(1) model does not significantly exceed 0.8. Next, ASAP3 computes the terms of an inverse Cornish-Fisher expansion for the classical batch means t-ratio based on the AR(1) parameter estimates; and finally ASAP3 delivers a correlation-adjusted confidence interval based on this expansion. Regarding not only conformance to the precision and coverage-probability requirements but also the mean and variance of the half-length of the delivered confidence interval, ASAP3 compared favorably to other batch means procedures (namely, ABATCH, ASAP, ASAP2, and LBATCH) in an extensive experimental performance evaluation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24903","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24903","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24904","fieldValue":" We develop in this article, four adaptive three-timescale stochastic approximation algorithms for simulation optimization that estimate both the gradient and Hessian of average cost at each update epoch. These algorithms use four, three, two, and one simulation(s), respectively, and update the values of the decision variable and Hessian matrix components simultaneously, with estimates based on the simultaneous perturbation methodology. Our algorithms use coupled stochastic recursions that proceed using three different timescales or step-size schedules. We present a detailed convergence analysis of the algorithms and show numerical experiments using all the developed algorithms on a two-node network of M\/G\/1 queues with feedback for a 50-dimensional parameter vector. We provide comparisons of the performance of these algorithms with two recently developed two-timescale steepest descent simultaneous perturbation analogs that use randomized and deterministic perturbation sequences, respectively. We also present experiments to explore the sensitivity of the algorithms to their associated parameters. The algorithms that use four and three simulations, respectively, perform significantly better than the rest of the algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24904","fieldValue":"Adaptive multivariate three-timescale stochastic approximation algorithms for simulation based optimization"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24904","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24904","fieldValue":"ACM"}
