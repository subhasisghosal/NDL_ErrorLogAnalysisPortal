Using theories and techniques from continuum percolation and ergodicity, we analytically characterize the connectivity of the secondary network defined in terms of the almost sure finiteness of the multihop delay, and show the occurrence of a phase transition phenomenon while studying the impact of the temporal dynamics of the primary traffic on the connectivity of the secondary network. Specifically, as long as the primary traffic has some temporal dynamics caused by either mobility and\/or changes in traffic load and pattern, the connectivity of the secondary network depends solely on its own density and is independent of the primary traffic; otherwise, the connectivity of the secondary network requires putting a density-dependent cap on the primary traffic load. We show that the scaling behavior of the multihop delay depends critically on whether or not the secondary network is instantaneously connected. In particular, we establish the scaling law of the minimum multihop delay with respect to the sourceâ\u20AC\u201Cdestination distance when the propagation delay is negligible."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10559","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10559","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10559","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10560","fieldValue":" The success of LTE heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with macrocells and picocells critically depends on efficient spectrum sharing between high-power macros and low-power picos. Two important challenges in this context are: 1) determining the amount of radio resources that macrocells should offer to picocells, and 2) determining the association rules that decide which user equipments (UEs) should associate with picos. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm to solve these two coupled problems in a joint manner. Our algorithm has provable guarantee, and furthermore, it accounts for network topology, traffic load, and macro-pico interference map. Our solution is standard compliant and can be implemented using the notion of Almost Blank Subframes (ABS) and Cell Selection Bias (CSB) proposed by LTE standards. We also show extensive evaluations using RF plan from a real network and discuss self-optimized networking (SON)-based enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10560","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10561","fieldValue":" We investigate the problem of minimizing the sum of the queue lengths of all the nodes in a wireless network with a forest topology. Each packet is destined to one of the roots (sinks) of the forest. We consider a time-slotted system and a primary (or one-hop) interference model. We characterize the existence of causal sample-path optimal scheduling policies for this network topology under this interference model. A causal sample-path optimal scheduling policy is one for which at each time-slot, and for any sample-path traffic arrival pattern, the sum of the queue lengths of all the nodes in the network is minimum among all policies. We show that such policies exist in restricted forest structures, and that for any other forest structure, there exists a traffic arrival pattern for which no causal sample-path optimal policy can exist. Surprisingly, we show that many forest structures for which such policies exist can be scheduled by converting the structure into an equivalent linear network and scheduling the equivalent linear network according to the one-hop interference model. The nonexistence of such policies in many forest structures underscores the inherent limitation of using sample-path optimality as a performance metric and necessitates the need to study other (relatively) weaker metrics of delay performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10561","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
