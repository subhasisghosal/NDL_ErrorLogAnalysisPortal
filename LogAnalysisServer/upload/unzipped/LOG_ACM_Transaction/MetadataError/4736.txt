{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25278","fieldValue":" Due to the rapid growth of the number of digital images on the Web, there is an increasing demand for an effective and efficient method for organizing and retrieving the available images. This article describes iFind, a system for clustering and searching WWW images. By using a vision-based page segmentation algorithm, a Web page is partitioned into blocks, and the textual and link information of an image can be accurately extracted from the block containing that image. The textual information is used for image indexing. By extracting the page-to-block, block-to-image, block-to-page relationships through link structure and page layout analysis, we construct an image graph. Our method is less sensitive to noisy links than previous methods like PageRank, HITS, and PicASHOW, and hence the image graph can better reflect the semantic relationship between images. Using the notion of Markov Chain, we can compute the limiting probability distributions of the images, ImageRanks, which characterize the importance of the images. The ImageRanks are combined with the relevance scores to produce the final ranking for image search. With the graph models, we can also use techniques from spectral graph theory for image clustering and embedding, or 2-D visualization. Some experimental results on 11.6 million images downloaded from the Web are provided in the article."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25278","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25278","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25279","fieldValue":" This article proposes a novel video abstraction framework for online review services of story-oriented videos such as dramas. Among the many genres of TV programs, a drama is one of the most popularly watched on the Web. The abstracts generated by the proposed framework not only give a summary of a video but also effectively help viewers understand the overall story. In addition, our method is duration-flexible. We get clues about human understanding of a story from scenario writing rules and editorial techniques that are popularly used in the process of video production to explicitly express a narrative, and propose a new video abstraction model, called a Narrative Abstraction Model. The model effectively captures the narrative structure embedded in a story-oriented video and articulates the progress of the story in a weighted directed graph, called a Narrative Structure Graph (NSG). The model provides a basis for a flexible framework for abstract generation using the NSG as the intermediary representation of a video. Different abstracts can be appropriately generated based upon different user requirements. To show the effectiveness of the proposed model and method, we developed a video abstraction system realizing the framework, and successfully applied it to large volumes of TV dramas. The evaluation results show that the proposed framework is a feasible solution for online review services."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25280","fieldValue":" Service usage in emerging ubiquitous environments includes seamless and personalized usage of public and private devices discovered in the vicinity of a user. In our work, we describe an architecture for device discovery, device configuration, and the transfer of active sessions between devices. The presented architecture uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as a standardized, widely used signaling protocol for IP-based multimedia services. Our solution includes support of simple existing devices, split of sessions between devices, user-control of location-based behavior, and handling of security and privacy concerns. We present the implementation and show the feasibility of our work with analytical evaluation and measurements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25280","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25280","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25281","fieldValue":"Chen, Herng-Yow"}
