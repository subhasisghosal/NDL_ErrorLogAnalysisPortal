Our algorithms perform word-level reasoning by using a combination of decision procedures in Boolean and integer and real domains, and use novel symbolic search strategies optimized specifically for sequential programs to improve scalability. Experiments on real-world C programs show that the new symbolic search algorithms can achieve several orders-of-magnitude improvements over existing methods based on bit-level (Boolean) reasoning."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13113","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13113","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13114","fieldValue":" This article describes several multiplexer-based interconnection strategies designed to improve energy consumption of stripe-based coarse-grain reconfigurable fabrics. Application requirements for the architecture as well as two dense subgraphs are extracted from a suite of signal and image processing benchmarks. These statistics are used to drive the strategy of the composition of multiplexer-based interconnect. The article compares interconnects that are fully connected between stripes, those with a cardinality of 8:1 to 4:1, and extensions that provide a 5:1 cardinality, limited 6:1 cardinality, and hybrids between 5:1 and 3:1 cardinalities. Additionally, dedicated vertical routes are considered replacing some computational units with dedicated pass-gates. Using a fabric interconnect model (FIM) written in XML, we demonstrate that fabric instances and mappers can be automatically generated using a Web-based design flow. Upon testing these instances, we found that using an 8:1 cardinality interconnect with 33&percnt; of the computational units replaced with dedicated pass-gates provided the best energy versus mappability tradeoff, resulting in a 50&percnt; energy improvement over fully connected rows and 20&percnt; energy improvement over an 8:1 cardinality interconnect without dedicated vertical routes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13114","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13114","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13115","fieldValue":"Sham, Chiu-Wing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13115","fieldValue":"Young, Evangeline F Y"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13115","fieldValue":" Routability optimization has become a major concern in physical design of VLSI circuits. Due to the recent advances in VLSI technology, interconnect has become a dominant factor of the overall performance of a circuit. In order to optimize interconnect cost, we need a good congestion estimation method to predict routability in the early designing stages. Many congestion models have been proposed but there's still a lot of room for improvement. Besides, routers will perform rip-up and reroute operations to prevent overflow, but most models do not consider this case. The outcome is that the existing models will usually underestimate the routability. In this paper, we have a comprehensive study on our proposed congestion models. Results show that the estimation results of our approaches are always more accurate than the previous congestion models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13115","fieldValue":"ACM"}
