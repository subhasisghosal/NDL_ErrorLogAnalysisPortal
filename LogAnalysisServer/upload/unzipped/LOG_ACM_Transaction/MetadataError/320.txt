The facility provides support for fault-tolerant process groups in the form of a family of reliable multicast protocols that can be used in both local- and wide-area networks. These protocols attain high levels of concurrency, while respecting application-specific delivery ordering constraints, and have varying cost and performance that depend on the degree of ordering desired. In particular, a protocol that enforces causal delivery orderings is introduced and shown to be a valuable alternative to conventional asynchronous communication protocols. The facility also ensures that the processes belonging to a fault-tolerant process group will observe consistent orderings of events affecting the group as a whole, including process failures, recoveries, migration, and dynamic changes to group properties like member rankings. A review of several uses for the protocols in the ISIS system, which supports fault-tolerant resilient objects and bulletin boards, illustrates the significant simplification of higher level algorithms made possible by our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12062","fieldValue":" A continuum of disk scheduling algorithms, V(R), having endpoints V(0) = SSTF and V(1) = SCAN, is defined. V(R) maintains a current SCAN direction (in or out) and services next the request with the smallest effective distance. The effective distance of a request that lies in the current direction is its physical distance (in cylinders) from the read\/write head. The effective distance of a request in the opposite direction is its physical distance plus R x (total number of cylinders on the disk). By use of simulation methods, it is shown that this definitional continuum also provides a continuum in performance, both with respect to the mean and with respect to the standard deviation of request waiting time. For objective functions that are linear combinations of the two measures, Î¼w + kow, intermediate points of the continuum are seen to provide performance uniformly superior to both SSTF and SCAN. A method of implementing V(R) and the results of its experimental use in a real system are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12063","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12063","fieldValue":"ACM"}
