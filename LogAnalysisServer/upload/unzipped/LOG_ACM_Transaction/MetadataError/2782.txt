{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2859","fieldValue":" In this paper, a hybrid language model is defined as a combination of a word-based n-gram, which is used to capture the local relations between words, and a category-based stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) with a word distribution into categories, which is defined to represent the long-term relations between these categories. The problem of unsupervised learning of a SCFG in General Format and in Chomsky Normal Form by means of estimation algorithms is studied. Moreover, a bracketed version of the classical estimation algorithm based on the Earley algorithm is proposed. This paper also explores the use of SCFGs obtained from a treebank corpus as initial models for the estimation algorithms. Experiments on the UPenn Treebank corpus are reported. These experiments have been carried out in terms of the test set perplexity and the word error rate in a speech recognition experiment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19213","fieldValue":" LAPACK is often mentioned as a positive example of a software library that encapsulates complex, robust, and widely used numerical algorithms for a wide range of applications. At installation time, the user has the option of running a (limited) number of test cases to verify the integrity of the installation process. On the algorithm developer's side, however, more exhaustive tests are usually performed to study algorithm behavior on a variety of problem settings and also computer architectures. In this process, difficult test cases need to be found that reflect particular challenges of an application or push algorithms to extreme behavior. These tests are then assembled into a comprehensive collection, therefore making it possible for any new or competing algorithm to be stressed in a similar way. This article describes an infrastructure for exhaustively testing the symmetric tridiagonal eigensolvers implemented in LAPACK. It consists of two parts: a selection of carefully chosen test matrices with particular idiosyncrasies and a portable testing framework that allows for easy testing and data processing. The tester facilitates experiments with algorithmic choices, parameter and threshold studies, and performance comparisons on different architectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19213","fieldValue":"LAPACK"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19213","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19213","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19214","fieldValue":" The software package SNOBFIT for bound-constrained (and soft-constrained) noisy optimization of an expensive objective function is described.
