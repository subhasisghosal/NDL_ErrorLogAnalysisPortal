In this article, we study the problem of optimizing sensor movement for energy efficiency. We adopt a complete energy model to characterize the entire energy consumption in movement. Based on the model, we propose an optimal trapezoidal velocity schedule for minimizing energy consumption when the road condition is uniform; and a corresponding velocity schedule for the variable road condition by using continuous-state dynamic programming. Considering the variety in motion hardware, we also design one velocity schedule for simple microcontrollers, and one velocity schedule for relatively complex microcontrollers, respectively. Simulation results show that our velocity planning may have significant impact on energy conservation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21357","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21357","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21358","fieldValue":" A stochastic model is formulated and analyzed to study the advancements of messages under greedy routing in a sensor network with a power-saving scheme. The aim of this model is give a better understanding of stochastic dependencies arising in the system and to offer a method of computing the advancement of message under greedy routing. We observe that the majority of the stochastic dependence from a routing path is captured by including only the previous forwarding node location. We examine a simple uncoordinated power-saving scheme with a new understanding of its effects on local node density. We propose a method for sensibly limiting the number of transmission reattempts before concluding there is no node in the forwarding region. All expressions involving multidimensional integrals are derived and evaluated readily with quasi-Monte Carlo integration methods. An importance sampling function is derived to speed up the quasi-Monte Carlo methods. The integral expressions are compared to simulations and give very agreeable results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21359","fieldValue":" In this article, we study the critical sensor density for partial connectivity of a large area sensor network.

Thus, methods used in practice are not guaranteed to find the correct localization, even if it is uniquely determined by the input distances. In this article, we show the following: if the sensors are allowed to wiggle, giving us perturbed distance data, we can apply a novel algorithm to realize arbitrary Generically Globally Rigid graphs (GGR), or certain vertex subsets in non-GGR graphs whose relative positions are fixed (which include vertex sets of GGR subgraphs). And this strategy works in any dimension. In the language of structural rigidity theory, our approach corresponds to calculating the approximate kernel of a generic stress matrix for the given graph and distance data. To make our algorithm suitable for real-world applications, we also present: (i) various techniques for improving the robustness of the algorithm in the presence of measurement noise; (ii) an algorithm for detecting certain subsets of graph vertices whose relative positions are fixed in any generic realization of the graph and robustly localizing these subsets of vertices, (iii) a strategy for reducing the number of measurements needed by the algorithm. We provide simulation results of our algorithm."}
