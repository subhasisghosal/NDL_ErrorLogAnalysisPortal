PRM has both a proactive and a reactive components; in this paper we describe how PRM can be used to improve the performance of application-layer multicast protocols especially when there are high packet losses and host failures. Through detailed analysis in this paper, we show that this loss recovery technique has efficient scaling properties-the overheads at each overlay node asymptotically decrease to zero with increasing group sizes.As a detailed case study, we show how PRM can be applied to the NICE application-layer multicast protocol. We present detailed simulations of the PRM-enhanced NICE protocol for 10000 node Internet-like topologies. Simulations show that PRM achieves a high delivery ratio (>97%) with a low latency bound (600 ms) for environments with high end-to-end network losses (1%-5%) and high topology change rates (5 changes per second) while incurring very low overheads ("}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9495","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9496","fieldValue":" To disseminate data to a heterogeneous body of receivers efficiently, congestion control protocols for IP multicast compose a session from several multicast groups and prescribe guidelines that enable each re ceiver to subscribe to an appropriate subset of the groups. However, a misbehaving receiver can ignore the group subscription rules and inflate its subscription to acquire unfairly high throughput. In this paper, we present the first solution for the problem of inflated subscription. Our design guards access to multicast groups with dynamic keys and consists of two independent components: DELTA (Distribution of ELigibility To Access)-a novel method for in-band distribution of group keys to receivers that are eligible to access the groups according to the congestion control protocol, and SIGMA (Secure Internet Group Management Architecture)-a generic architecture for key-based group access at edge routers. We apply DELTA and SIGMA to derive robust versions of prominent RLM and FLID-DL protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9496","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/9496","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"10.1109.\/TNET.2006.872573\"}"}
