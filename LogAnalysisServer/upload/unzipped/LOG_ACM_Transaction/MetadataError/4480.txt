We provide a formal analysis of the LAKE protocol under the Canetti-Krawczyk model and prove it to be secure.

However, in many networks the service provider only allows use of devices obtained directly from the provider. We review how United States communications law addresses the rights of users to connect devices of their choice. We explicate a set of user and service provider rights. We propose legal requirements for attachment and management of devices. We illustrate how these proposed regulations would affect the services currently offered on telephone, cable, satellite, video networks, and cellular networks, as well as on the Internet."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24455","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24455","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24456","fieldValue":"Madnick, Stuart E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24456","fieldValue":" We present a comprehensive classification of data misinterpretation problems and develop an approach to automatic detection and reconciliation of data interpretation conflicts in Web services composition. The approach uses a lightweight ontology augmented with modifiers, contexts, and atomic conversions between the contexts. The WSDL descriptions of Web services are annotated to establish correspondences to the ontology. Given the naive Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) specification of the desired Web services composition with data interpretation conflicts, the approach can automatically detect the conflicts and produce the corresponding mediated BPEL. Finally, we develop a prototype to validate and evaluate the approach."}
