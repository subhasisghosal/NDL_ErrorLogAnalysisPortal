By partitioning data items into primary and secondary record segments, storing them in physically separate files, and judiciously allocating available buffer space to the two files, it is possible to significantly reduce the average cost of information retrieval from a shared database. An analytic model, based upon knowledge of data item lengths, data access costs, and user retrieval patterns, is developed to assist an analyst with this assignment problem. A computationally tractable design algorithm is presented and results of its application are described."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2302","fieldValue":" We present the priority R-tree, or PR-tree, which is the first R-tree variant that always answers a window query using $O((N\/B)^1âˆ\u20191\/d$&plus;T\/B) I\/Os, where N is the number of d-dimensional (hyper-) rectangles stored in the R-tree, B is the disk block size, and T is the output size. This is provably asymptotically optimal and significantly better than other R-tree variants, where a query may visit all N\/B leaves in the tree even when T &equals; 0. We also present an extensive experimental study of the practical performance of the PR-tree using both real-life and synthetic data. This study shows that the PR-tree performs similarly to the best-known R-tree variants on real-life and relatively nicely distributed data, but outperforms them significantly on more extreme data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13807","fieldValue":" RAP (Relational Associative Processor) is a â\u20ACœback-endâ\u20AC? database processor that is intended to take over much of the effort of database management in a computer system. In order to enhance RAP's performance its design includes mechanisms for permitting features analogous to multiprogramming and virtual memory as in general purpose computer systems. It is the purpose of this paper to present the detailed design of these mechanisms, along with some analysis that supports their value. Specifically, (1) the response time provided by RAP under several scheduling disciplines involving priority by class is analyzed, (2) the cost effectiveness of the additional hardware in RAP necessary to support multiprogramming is assessed, and (3) a detailed design of the RAP virtual memory system and its monitor is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13807","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13807","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13808","fieldValue":" In a multiattribute relation or, equivalently, a multicolumn table a certain collection of the projections can be shown to be independent in much the same way as the factors in a Cartesian product or orthogonal components of a vector. A precise notion of independence for relations is defined and studied. The main result states that the operator which reconstructs the original relation from its independent components is the natural join, and that independent components split the full family of functional dependencies into corresponding component families. These give an easy-to-check criterion for independence."}
