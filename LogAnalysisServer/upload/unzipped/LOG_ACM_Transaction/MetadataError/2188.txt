{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2638","fieldValue":" Link reversal is a versatile algorithm design paradigm, originally proposed by Gafni and Bertsekas in 1981 for routing and subsequently applied to other problems including mutual exclusion, leader election, and resource allocation. Although these algorithms are well known, until now there have been only preliminary results on time complexity, even for the simplest link reversal algorithm for routing, called Full Reversal. In Full Reversal, a sink reverses all its incident links, whereas in other link reversal algorithms (e.g., Partial Reversal), a sink reverses only some of its incident links. Charron-Bost et al. introduced a generalization, called LR, that includes Full and Partial Reversal as special cases. In this article, we present an exact expression for the time complexity of LR. The expression is stated in terms of simple properties of the initial graph. The result specializes to exact formulas for the time complexity of any node in any initial acyclic directed graph for both Full and Partial Reversal. Having the exact formulas provides insight into the behavior of Full and Partial Reversal on specific graph families. Our first technical insight is to describe the behavior of Full Reversal as a dynamical system and to observe that this system is linear in min-plus algebra. Our second technical insight is to overcome the difficulty posed by the fact that LR is not linear by transforming every execution of LR from an initial graph into an execution of Full Reversal from a different initial graph while maintaining the execution's work and time complexity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2638","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2638","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17318","fieldValue":" We present a fully automatic method for generating guaranteed bijective surface parameterizations from triangulated 3D surfaces partitioned into charts. We do so by using a distortion metric that prevents local folds of triangles in the parameterization and a barrier function that prevents intersection of the chart boundaries. In addition, we show how to modify the line search of an interior point method to directly compute the singularities of the distortion metric and barrier functions to maintain a bijective map. By using an isometric metric that is efficient to compute and a spatial hash to accelerate the evaluation and gradient of the barrier function for the boundary, we achieve fast optimization times. Unlike previous methods, we do not require the boundary be constrained by the user to a non-intersecting shape to guarantee a bijection, and the boundary of the parameterization is free to change shape during the optimization to minimize distortion."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17318","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Texas A&#38;M University (Smith, Jason; Schaefer, Scott)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17318","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17318","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17319","fieldValue":"Fu, Xiao-Ming"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17319","fieldValue":" Computing locally injective mappings with low distortion in an efficient way is a fundamental task in computer graphics. By revisiting the well-known MIPS (Most-Isometric ParameterizationS) method, we introduce an advanced MIPS method that inherits the local injectivity of MIPS, achieves as low as possible distortions compared to the state-of-the-art locally injective mapping techniques, and performs one to two orders of magnitude faster in computing a mesh-based mapping. The success of our method relies on two key components. The first one is an enhanced MIPS energy function that penalizes the maximal distortion significantly and distributes the distortion evenly over the domain for both mesh-based and meshless mappings. The second is a use of the inexact block coordinate descent method in mesh-based mapping in a way that efficiently minimizes the distortion with the capability not to be trapped early by the local minimum. We demonstrate the capability and superiority of our method in various applications including mesh parameterization, mesh-based and meshless deformation, and mesh improvement."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17319","fieldValue":"ACM"}
