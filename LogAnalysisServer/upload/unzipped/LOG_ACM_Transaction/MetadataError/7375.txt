{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9560","fieldValue":" The paper focuses on the assignment of a common bandwidth resource to TCP connections over a satellite channel. The connections are grouped according to their source-destination pairs, which correspond to the up- and down-link channels traversed, and each group may experience different fading conditions. By exploiting the tradeoff between bandwidth and channel redundancy (as determined by bit and coding rates) in the maximization of TCP goodput, an overall optimization problem is constructed, which can be solved by numerical techniques. Different relations between goodput maximization and fairness of the allocations are investigated, and a possible pricing scheme is proposed. The allocation strategies are tested and compared in a fading environment, first under static conditions, and then in a real dynamic scenario. The goodput-fairness optimization allows significant gains over bandwidth allocations only aimed at keeping the channel bit error rate below a given threshold in all fading conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9560","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9560","fieldValue":"Long-lived TCP connections via satellite: cross-layer bandwidth allocation, pricing, and adaptive control"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9561","fieldValue":" This paper examines some issues that affect the efficiency and fairness of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the backbone of Internet protocol communication, in multihops satellite network systems. It proposes a scheme that allows satellite systems to automatically adapt to any change in the number of active TCP flows due to handover occurrence, the free buffer size, and the bandwidth-delay product of the network.The proposed scheme has two major design goals: increasing the system efficiency, and improving its fairness. The system efficiency is controlled by matching the aggregate traffic rate to the sum of the link capacity and total buffer size. On the other hand, the system min-max fairness is achieved by allocating bandwidth among individual flows in proportion with their RTTs. The proposed scheme is dыпн Recursive, Explicit, and Fair Window Adjustment (REFWA).Simulation results elucidate that the REFWA scheme substantially improves the system fairness, reduces the number of packet drops, and makes better utilization of the bottleneck link. The results demonstrate also that the proposed scheme works properly in more complicated environments where connections traverse multiple bottlenecks and the available bandwidth may change over data transmission time."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9561","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9561","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9561","fieldValue":"ACM"}
