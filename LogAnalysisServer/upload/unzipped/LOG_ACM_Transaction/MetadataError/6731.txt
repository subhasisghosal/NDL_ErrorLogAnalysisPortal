However, it is very challenging to perform classification in P2P networks due to many practical issues, such as scalability, peer dynamism, and asynchronism. This article investigates the practical techniques of constructing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers in the P2P networks. In particular, we demonstrate how to efficiently cascade SVM in a P2P network with the use of reduced SVM. In addition, we propose to fuse the concept of cascade SVM with bootstrap aggregation to effectively balance the trade-off between classification accuracy, model construction, and prediction cost. We provide theoretical insights for the proposed solutions and conduct an extensive set of empirical studies on a number of large-scale datasets. Encouraging results validate the efficacy of the proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7960","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7960","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7961","fieldValue":"Introduction to special issue on computational aspects of social and information networks: Theory, methodologies, and applications (TKDD-CASIN)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7961","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7961","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1720","fieldValue":" The Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMxV) kernel exhibits poor scaling on shared memory systems, due to the streaming nature of its data access pattern. To decrease memory contention and improve kernel performance we propose two compression schemes: CSR-DU, that targets the reduction of the matrix structural data by applying coarse-grained delta-encoding, and CSR-VI, that targets the reduction of the values using indirect indexing, applicable to matrices with a small number of unique values. Thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed methods and their combination, on two modern shared memory systems, demonstrated that they can significantly improve multithreaded SpMxV performance upon standard and state-of-the-art approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1720","fieldValue":"ACM"}
