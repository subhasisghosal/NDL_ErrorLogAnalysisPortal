This model is encoded as a set of prototypical interaction graphs (PiGraphs), a human-centric representation capturing physical contact and visual attention linkages between 3D geometry and human body parts. We use this encoding of the joint probability distribution over pose and geometry during everyday interactions to generate interaction snapshots, which are static depictions of human poses and relevant objects during human-object interactions. We demonstrate that our model enables a novel human-centric understanding of 3D content and allows for jointly generating 3D scenes and interaction poses given terse high-level specifications, natural language, or reconstructed real-world scene constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17627","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17627","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17628","fieldValue":"Dischler, Jean-Michel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17628","fieldValue":" Texture synthesis is a well-established area, with many important applications in computer graphics and vision. However, despite their success, synthesis techniques are not used widely in practice because the creation of good exemplars remains challenging and extremely tedious. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised method for analyzing texture content across multiple scales that automatically extracts good exemplars from natural images. Unlike existing methods, which require extensive manual tuning, our method is fully automatic. This allows the user to focus on using texture palettes derived from their own images, rather than on manual interactions dictated by the needs of an underlying algorithm. Most natural textures exhibit patterns at multiple scales that may vary according to the location (non-stationarity). To handle such textures many synthesis algorithms rely on an analysis of the input and a guidance of the synthesis. Our new analysis is based on a labeling of texture patterns that is both (i) multi-scale and (ii) unsupervised -- that is, patterns are labeled at multiple scales, and the scales and the number of labeled clusters are selected automatically. Our method works in two stages. The first builds a hierarchical extension of superpixels and the second labels the superpixels based on random walk in a graph of similarity between superpixels and a nonnegative matrix factorization. Our label-maps provide descriptors for pixels and regions that benefit state-of-the-art texture synthesis algorithms. We show several applications including guidance of non-stationary synthesis, content selection and texture painting. Our method is designed to treat large inputs and can scale to many megapixels. In addition to traditional exemplar inputs, our method can also handle natural images containing different textured regions."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17628","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Yale University, New Haven (Lockerman, Yitzchak David; Dorsey, Julie; Rushmeier, Holly); ICube, Universit&#233; de Strasbourg, CNRS, France (Sauvage, Basile; Allgre, Rmi; Dischler, Jean-Michel)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17628","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17628","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17629","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}
