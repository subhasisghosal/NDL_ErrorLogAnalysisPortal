ASEP has been used to model and analyze numerous multiagent systems with local interactions including the flow of ribosomes along the mRNA strand. In ASEP with periodic boundary conditions a particle that hops from the last site returns to the first one. The mean field approximation of this model is referred to as the ribosome flow model on a ring (RFMR). The RFMR may be used to model both synthetic and endogenous gene expression regimes. We analyze the RFMR using the theory of monotone dynamical systems. We show that it admits a continuum of equilibrium points and that every trajectory converges to an equilibrium point. Furthermore, we show that it entrains to periodic transition rates between the sites. We describe the implications of the analysis results to understanding and engineering cyclic mRNA translation in-vitro and in-vivo."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5274","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5275","fieldValue":" In this experiment, a gene selection technique was proposed to select a robust gene signature from microarray data for prediction of breast cancer recurrence. In this regard, a hybrid scoring criterion was designed as linear combinations of the scores that were determined in the mutual information (MI) domain and protein-protein interactions network. Whereas, the MI-based score represents the complementary information between the selected genes for outcome prediction; and the number of connections in the PPI network between the selected genes builds the PPI-based score. All genes were scored by using the proposed function in a hybrid forward-backward gene-set selection process to select the optimum biomarker-set from the gene expression microarray data. The accuracy and stability of the finally selected biomarkers were evaluated by using five-fold cross-validation (CV) to classify available data on breast cancer patients into two cohorts of poor and good prognosis. The results showed an appealing improvement in the cross-dataset accuracy in comparison with similar studies whenever we applied a primary signature, which was selected from one dataset, to predict survival in other independent datasets. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrated 58-92 percent overlap between 50-genes signatures, which were selected from seven independent datasets individually."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5275","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5275","fieldValue":"Stable Gene Signature Selection for Prediction of Breast Cancer Recurrence Using Joint Mutual Information"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5275","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5275","fieldValue":"ACM"}
