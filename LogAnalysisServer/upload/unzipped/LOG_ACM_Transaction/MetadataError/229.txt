It generalizes concurrent constraint logic programming to multiple heads, thus closing the gap to multiset transformation systems. Its popular extension CHR with Disjunction (CHR∨) is a multiparadigm declarative programming language that allows embedding of Horn programs with SLD resolution. We analyze the assets and the limitations of the classical declarative semantics of CHR∨ and highlight its natural relationship with linear-logic. We furthermore develop two linear-logic semantics for CHR∨ that differ in the reasoning domain for which they are instrumental. We show their idempotence and their soundness and completeness with respect to the operational semantics. We show how to apply the linear-logic semantics to decide program properties and to reason about operational equivalence of CHR∨ programs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11655","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11655","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2066","fieldValue":" Allocating memory dynamically for virtual machines (VMs) according to their demands provides significant benefits as well as great challenges. Efficient memory resource management requires knowledge of the memory demands of applications or systems at runtime. A widely proposed approach is to construct a miss ratio curve (MRC) for a VM, which not only summarizes the current working set size (WSS) of the VM but also models the relationship between its performance and the target memory allocation size. Unfortunately, the cost of monitoring and maintaining the MRC structures is nontrivial. This article first introduces a low-cost WSS tracking system with effective optimizations on data structures, as well as an efficient mechanism to decrease the frequency of monitoring. We also propose a Memory Balancer (MEB), which dynamically reallocates guest memory based on the predicted WSS. Our experimental results show that our prediction schemes yield a high accuracy of 95.2&percnt; and low overhead of 2&percnt;. Furthermore, the overall system throughput can be significantly improved with MEB, which brings a speedup up to 7.4 for two to four VMs and 4.54 for an overcommitted system with 16 VMs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11656","fieldValue":" Description logics (DLs) have become a prominent paradigm for representing knowledge in a variety of application areas, partly due to their ability to achieve a favourable balance between expressivity of the logic and performance of reasoning. Horn description logics are obtained, roughly speaking, by disallowing all forms of disjunctions. They have attracted attention since their (worst-case) data complexities are in general lower than those of their non-Horn counterparts, which makes them attractive for reasoning with large sets of instance data (ABoxes). It is therefore natural to ask whether Horn DLs also provide advantages for schema (TBox) reasoning, that is, whether they also feature lower combined complexities. This article settles this question for a variety of Horn DLs. An example of a tractable Horn logic is the DL underlying the ontology language OWL RL, which we characterize as the Horn fragment of the description logic SROIQ without existential quantifiers. If existential quantifiers are allowed, however, many Horn DLs become intractable. We find that Horn-ALC already has the same worst-case complexity as ALC, that is, ExpTime, but we also identify various DLs for which reasoning is PSpace-complete. As a side effect, we derive simplified syntactic definitions of Horn DLs for which we exploit suitable normal form transformations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11656","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11656","fieldValue":"ACM"}
