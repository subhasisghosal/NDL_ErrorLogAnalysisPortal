With the emergence of drug resistant strains, S. aureus represents a significant human health threat. Identifying the family types efficiently and quickly is crucial in community settings. Here, we develop a hybrid sequence algorithm approach to type this bacterium using only its spa gene. Two of the sequence algorithms we used are well established, while the third, the Best Common Gap-Weighted Sequence (BCGS), is novel. We combined the sequence algorithms with a weighted match\/mismatch algorithm for the spa sequence ends. Normalized similarity scores and distances between the sequences were derived and used within unsupervised clustering methods. The resulting spa groupings correlated strongly with the groups defined by the well-established Multi locus sequence typing (MLST) method. Spa typing is preferable to MLST typing which types seven genes instead of just one. Furthermore, our spa clustering methods can be fine-tuned to be more discriminative than MLST, identifying new strains that the MLST method may not. Finally, we performed a multidimensional scaling of our distance matrices to visualize the relationship between isolates. The proposed methodology provides a promising new approach to molecular epidemiology."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4332","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4117","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4333","fieldValue":" In previous work, we presented GAMI [1], an approach to motif inference that uses a genetic algorithms search. GAMI is designed specifically to find putative conserved regulatory motifs in noncoding regions of divergent species, and is designed to allow for analysis of long nucleotide sequences. In this work, we compare GAMI's performance when run with its original fitness function (a simple count of the number of matches) and when run with information content, as well as several variations on these metrics. Results indicate that information content does not identify highly conserved regions, and thus is not the appropriate metric for this task, while variations on information content as well as the original metric sì³®d in identifying putative conserved regions."}
