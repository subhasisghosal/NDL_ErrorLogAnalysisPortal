In the last decade, the analysis of such content has gained importance due to its high potential for monetization. Despite the vast interest in sentiment analysis, somewhat surprisingly, the discovery of sentimental or opinionated Web content is mostly ignored. This work aims to fill this gap and addresses the problem of quickly discovering and fetching the sentimental content present in the Web. To this end, we design a sentiment-focused Web crawling framework. In particular, we propose different sentiment-focused Web crawling strategies that prioritize discovered URLs based on their predicted sentiment scores. Through simulations, these strategies are shown to achieve considerable performance improvement over general-purpose Web crawling strategies in discovery of sentimental Web content."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23304","fieldValue":" Developing and deploying Web applications on networked embedded devices is often seen as a way to reduce the development cost and time to market for new target platforms. However, the size of the messages and the processing requirements of today's Web protocols, such as HTTP and XML, are challenging for the most resource-constrained class of devices that could also benefit from Web connectivity. New Web protocols using binary representations have been proposed for addressing this issue. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) reduces the bandwidth and processing requirements compared to HTTP while preserving the core concepts of the Web architecture. Similarly, Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) format has been standardized for reducing the size and processing time for XML structured information. Nevertheless, the adoption of these technologies is lagging behind due to lack of support from Web browsers and current Web development toolkits. Motivated by these problems, this article presents the design and implementation techniques for the EXIP framework for embedded Web development. The framework consists of a highly efficient EXI processor, a tool for EXI data binding based on templates, and a CoAP\/EXI\/XHTML Web page engine. A prototype implementation of the EXI processor is herein presented and evaluated. It can be applied to Web browsers or thin server platforms using XHTML and Web services for supporting human-machine interactions in the Internet of Things. This article contains four major results: (1) theoretical and practical evaluation of the use of binary protocols for embedded Web programming; (2) a novel method for generation of EXI grammars based on XML Schema definitions; (3) an algorithm for grammar concatenation that produces normalized EXI grammars directly, and hence reduces the number of iterations during grammar generation; (4) an algorithm for efficient representation of possible deviations from the XML schema."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23304","fieldValue":"EXI"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23304","fieldValue":"XHTML"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23304","fieldValue":"XML"}
