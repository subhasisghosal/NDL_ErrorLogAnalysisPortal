While being information-rich resources, documents are usually not treated as content-bearing items in faceted browsing interfaces, and yet the required clean metadata is not always available or matches usersâ\u20AC™ interest. In addition, the existing linear listing paradigm for representing result items from the faceted filtering process makes it difficult for users to traverse or compare across facet values in different orders of importance to them. In this context, we report in this article a visual support toward faceted browsing of a collection of documents based on a set of entities of interest to users. Our proposed approach involves using a multi-dimensional visualization as an alternative to the linear listing of focus items. In this visualization, visual abstraction based on a combination of a conceptual structure and the structural equivalence of documents can be simultaneously used to deal with a large number of items. Furthermore, the approach also enables visual ordering based on the importance of facet values to support prioritized, cross-facet comparisons of focus items. A user study was conducted and the results suggest that interfaces using the proposed approach can support users better in exploratory tasks and were also well-liked by the participants of the study, with the hybrid interface combining the multi-dimensional visualization with the linear listing receiving the most favorable ratings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7386","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7386","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7387","fieldValue":"Candan, K Seluk"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7387","fieldValue":"Di Caro, Luigi"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7387","fieldValue":" The high-dimensional nature of the textual data complicates the design of visualization tools to support exploration of large document corpora. In this article, we first argue that the Parallel Coordinates (PC) technique, which can map multidimensional vectors onto a 2D space in such a way that elements with similar values are represented as similar poly-lines or curves in the visualization space, can be used to help users discern patterns in document collections. The inherent reduction in dimensionality during the mapping from multidimensional points to 2D lines, however, may result in visual complications. For instance, the lines that correspond to clusters of objects that are separate in the multidimensional space may overlap each other in the 2D space; the resulting increase in the number of crossings would make it hard to distinguish the individual document clusters. Such crossings of lines and overly dense regions are significant sources of visual clutter, thus avoiding them may help interpret the visualization. In this article, we note that visual clutter can be significantly reduced by adjusting the resolution of the individual term coordinates by clustering the corresponding values. Such reductions in the resolution of the individual term-coordinates, however, will lead to a certain degree of information loss and thus the appropriate resolution for the term-coordinates has to be selected carefully. Thus, in this article we propose a controlled clutter reduction approach, called Parallel hierarchical Coordinates (or PhC), for reducing the visual clutter in PC-based visualizations of text corpora. We define visual clutter and information loss measures and provide extensive evaluations that show that the proposed PhC provides significant visual gains (i.e., multiple orders of reductions in visual clutter) with small information loss during visualization and exploration of document collections."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7387","fieldValue":"PhC: Multiresolution Visualization and Exploration of Text Corpora with Parallel Hierarchical Coordinates"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7387","fieldValue":"ACM"}
