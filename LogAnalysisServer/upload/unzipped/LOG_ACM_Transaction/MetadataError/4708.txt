In order to mitigate the destructive effects of lava flows along volcanic slopes, the building and positioning of artificial barriers is fundamental for controlling and slowing down the lava flow advance. In this article, an evolutionary computation-based decision support system for defining and optimizing volcanic hazard mitigation interventions is proposed. In particular, the SCIARA-fv2 Cellular Automata numerical model has been applied for simulating lava flows at Mt. Etna (Italy) volcano and Parallel Genetic Algorithms (PGA) adopted for optimizing protective measures construction by morphological evolution. The PGA application regarded the optimization of the position, orientation, and extension of earth barriers built to protect Rifugio Sapienza, a touristic facility located near the summit of the volcano. A preliminary release of the algorithm, called single barrier (SBA) approach, was initially considered. Subsequently, a second GA strategy, called Evolutionary Greedy Strategy (EGS), was implemented by introducing multibarrier protection measures in order to improve the efficiency of the final solution. Finally, a Coevolutionary Cooperative Strategy (CCS), has been introduced where all barriers are encoded in the genotype and, because all the constituents parts of the solution interact with the GA environment, a mechanism of cooperation between individuals has been favored. The study has produced extremely positive results and represents, to our knowledge, the first application of morphological evolution for lava flow mitigation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25157","fieldValue":" Multipotent differentiation, where cells adopt one of several cell fates, is a determinate and orchestrated procedure that often incorporates stochastic mechanisms in order to diversify cell types. How these stochastic phenomena interact to govern cell fate is poorly understood. Nonetheless, cell fate decision-making procedure is mainly regulated through the activation of differentiation waves and associated signaling pathways. In the current work, we focus on the Notch\/Delta signaling pathway, which is not only known to trigger such waves but also is used to achieve the principle of lateral inhibition (i.e., a competition for exclusive fates through cross-signaling between neighboring cells). Such a process ensures unambiguous stochastic decisions influenced by intrinsic noise sources, such as those found in the regulation of signaling pathways, and extrinsic stochastic fluctuations attributed to microenvironmental factors. However, the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic noise on cell fate determination is an open problem. Our goal is to elucidate how the induction of extrinsic noise affects cell fate specification in a lateral inhibition mechanism. Using a stochastic Cellular Automaton with continuous state space, we show that extrinsic noise results in the emergence of steady-state furrow patterns of cells in a â\u20ACœfrustrated\/transientâ\u20AC? phenotypic state."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25157","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25157","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25158","fieldValue":" Serious problems with bridging multiple scales in the scope of a single numerical model make computer simulations too demanding computationally and highly unreliable. We present a new concept of modeling framework that integrates the particle method with graph dynamical systems, called the particle automata model (PAM). We assume that the mechanical response of a macroscopic system on internal or external stimuli can be simulated by the spatiotemporal dynamics of a graph of interacting particles representing fine-grained components of biological tissue, such as cells, cell clusters, or microtissue fragments. Meanwhile, the dynamics of microscopic processes can be represented by evolution of internal particle states represented by vectors of finite-state automata. To demonstrate the broad scope of application of PAM, we present three models of very different biological phenomena: blood clotting, tumor proliferation, and fungal wheat infection. We conclude that the generic and flexible modeling framework provided by PAM may contribute to more intuitive and faster development of computational models of complex multiscale biological processes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25158","fieldValue":"ACM"}
