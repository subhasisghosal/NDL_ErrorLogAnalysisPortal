These transportation systems generate sizable transportation data, the mining of which can reveal the underlying urban phenomenon linked to city dynamics. This article presents a statistical model to automatically analyze the trip data of a bike sharing system. The proposed solution partitions (i.e., clusters) the stations according to their usage profiles. To do so, count series describing the stationsâ\u20AC™s usage through departure\/arrival counts per hour throughout the day are built and analyzed. The model for processing these count series is based on Poisson mixtures and introduces a station scaling factor that handles the differences between the stationsâ\u20AC™s global usage. Differences between weekday and weekend usage are also taken into account. This model identifies the latent factors that shape the geography of trips, and the results may thus offer insights into the relationships between station neighborhood type (its amenities, its demographics, etc.) and the generated mobility patterns. In other words, the proposed method brings to light the different functions in different areas that induce specific patterns in BSS data. These potentials are demonstrated through an in-depth analysis of the results obtained on the Paris VÃ©libâ\u20AC™ large-scale bike sharing system."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7555","fieldValue":"Model-Based Count Series Clustering for Bike Sharing System Usage Mining: A Case Study with the VÃ©libâ\u20AC™ System of Paris"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7555","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7555","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7556","fieldValue":"Ying, Josh Jia-Ching"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7556","fieldValue":"Kuo, Wen-Ning"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7556","fieldValue":"Lu, Eric Hsueh-Chan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7556","fieldValue":" In recent years, research into the mining of user check-in behavior for point-of-interest (POI) recommendations has attracted a lot of attention. Existing studies on this topic mainly treat such recommendations in a traditional mannerâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, they treat POIs as items and check-ins as ratings. However, users usually visit a place for reasons other than to simply say that they have visited. In this article, we propose an approach referred to as Urban POI-Walk (UPOI-Walk), which takes into account a user's social-triggered intentions (SI), preference-triggered intentions (PreI), and popularity-triggered intentions (PopI), to estimate the probability of a user checking-in to a POI. The core idea of UPOI-Walk involves building a HITS-based random walk on the normalized check-in network, thus supporting the prediction of POI properties related to each user's preferences. To achieve this goal, we define several user--POI graphs to capture the key properties of the check-in behavior motivated by user intentions. In our UPOI-Walk approach, we propose a new kind of random walk modelâ\u20AC\u201DDynamic HITS-based Random Walkâ\u20AC\u201Dwhich comprehensively considers the relevance between POIs and users from different aspects. On the basis of similitude, we make an online recommendation as to the POI the user intends to visit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on urban POI recommendations that considers user check-in behavior motivated by SI, PreI, and PopI in location-based social network data. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations on two real datasets, the proposed UPOI-Walk is shown to deliver excellent performance."}
