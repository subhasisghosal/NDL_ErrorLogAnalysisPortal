Personalized medicine and gene therapy will confluence the days to come. This review highlights traditional approaches as well as current advancements in the analysis of the gene expression data from cancer perspective. Due to improvements in biometric instrumentation and automation, it has become easier to collect a lot of experimental data in molecular biology. Analysis of such data is extremely important as it leads to knowledge discovery that can be validated by experiments. Previously, the diagnosis of complex genetic diseases has conventionally been done based on the non-molecular characteristics like kind of tumor tissue, pathological characteristics, and clinical phase. The microarray data can be well accounted for high dimensional space and noise. Same were the reasons for ineffective and imprecise results. Several machine learning and data mining techniques are presently applied for identifying cancer using gene expression data. While differences in efficiency do exist, none of the well-established approaches is uniformly superior to others. The quality of algorithm is important, but is not in itself a guarantee of the quality of a specific data analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5062","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5063","fieldValue":"Wong, Andrew K C"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5063","fieldValue":"Lee, En-Shiun Annie"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5063","fieldValue":" Discovering sequence patterns with variations unveils significant functions of a protein family. Existing combinatorial methods of discovering patterns with variations are computationally expensive, and probabilistic methods require more elaborate probabilistic representation of the amino acid associations. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper presents a new computationally efficient method for representing patterns with variations in a compact representation called Aligned Pattern Cluster (AP Cluster). To tackle the runtime, our method discovers a shortened list of non-redundant statistically significant sequence associations based on our previous work. To address the representation of protein functional regions, our pattern alignment and clustering step, presented in this paper captures the conservations and variations of the aligned patterns. We further refine our solution to allow more coverage of sequences via extending the AP Clusters containing only statistically significant patterns to Weak and Conserved AP Clusters. When applied to the cytochrome c, the ubiquitin, and the triosephosphate isomerase protein families, our algorithm identifies the binding segments as well as the binding residues. When compared to other methods, ours discovers all binding sites in the AP Clusters with superior entropy and coverage. The identification of patterns with variations help biologists to avoid time-consuming simulations and experimentations.
