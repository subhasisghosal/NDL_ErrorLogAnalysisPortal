Each subfile contains selected attribute data for all records. It is shown that transposed file performance can be enhanced by using a proper strategy to process queries. Analytic cost expressions for processing conjunctive, disjunctive, and batched queries are developed and an effective heuristic for minimizing query processing costs is presented. Formulations of the problem of optimally processing queries for a particular family or transposed files are shown to be NP-complete. Query processing performance comparisons of multilist, inverted, and nonsequential files with transposed files are also considered."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13861","fieldValue":" The declining cost of computer hardware and the increasing data processing needs of geographically dispersed organizations have led to substantial interest in distributed data management. SDD-1 is a distributed database management system currently being developed by Computer Corporation of America. Users interact with SDD-1 precisely as if it were a nondistributed database system because SDD-1 handles all issues arising from the distribution of data. These issues include distributed concurrency control, distributed query processing, resiliency to component failure, and distributed directory management. This paper presents an overview of the SDD-1 design and its solutions to the above problems.This paper is the first of a series of companion papers on SDD-1 (Bernstein and Shipman [2], Bernstein et al. [4], and Hammer and Shipman [14])."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13862","fieldValue":" This paper presents the concurrency control strategy of SDD-1. SDD-1, a System for Distributed Databases, is a prototype distributed database system being developed by Computer Corporation of America. In SDD-1, portions of data distributed throughout a network may be replicated at multiple sites. The SDD-1 concurrency control guarantees database consistency in the face of such distribution and replication.This paper is one of a series of companion papers on SDD-1 [4, 10, 12, 21]."}
