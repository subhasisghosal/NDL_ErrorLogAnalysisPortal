A major difficulty for cross-lingual information retrieval is the detection and translation of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms; for OOV terms in Chinese, another difficulty is segmentation. At NTCIR-4, we explored methods for translation and disambiguation for OOV terms when using a Chinese query on an English collection. We have developed a new segmentation-free technique for automatic translation of Chinese OOV terms using the web. We have also investigated the effects of distance factor and window size when using a hidden Markov model to provide disambiguation. Our experiments show these methods significantly improve effectiveness; in conjunction with our post-translation query expansion technique, effectiveness approaches that of monolingual retrieval."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2872","fieldValue":"CLIR"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2872","fieldValue":"HMM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2872","fieldValue":"Chinese OOV translation and post-translation query expansion in chinese--english cross-lingual information retrieval"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2872","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2872","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19363","fieldValue":" We present the fast approximation of multivariate functions based on Chebyshev series for two types of Chebyshev lattices and show how a fast Fourier transform (FFT) based discrete cosine transform (DCT) can be used to reduce the complexity of this operation. Approximating multivariate functions using rank-1 Chebyshev lattices can be seen as a one-dimensional DCT while a full-rank Chebyshev lattice leads to a multivariate DCT. We also present a MATLAB\/Octave toolbox which uses this fast algorithms to approximate functions on a axis aligned hyper-rectangle. Given a certain accuracy of this approximation, interpolation of the original function can be achieved by evaluating the approximation while the definite integral over the domain can be estimated based on this Chebyshev approximation. We conclude with an example for both operations and actual timings of the two methods presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19363","fieldValue":"CHEBINT: A MATLAB\/Octave toolbox for fast multivariate integration and interpolation based on chebyshev approximations over hypercubes"}
