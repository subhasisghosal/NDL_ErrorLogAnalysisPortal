This supervised learning method trains a special recurrent neural network to use very long ranged symmetric sequence context using a combination of nonlinear processing elements and linear feedback loops for storing long-range context. The algorithm is applied to the sequence-based prediction of protein localization and predicts 93.3% novel non-plant proteins and 88.4% novel plant proteins correctly, which is an improvement over feedforward and standard recurrent networks solving the same problem. The BLSTM system is available as a web-service (http:\/\/www.stepc.gr\/~synaptic\/blstm.html)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4307","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4307","fieldValue":"Recurrent neural networks, long shortterm memory, biological sequence analysis, protein subcellular localization prediction"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4307","fieldValue":"Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Predicting the Subcellular Localization of Eukaryotic Proteins"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4308","fieldValue":" This article introduces an algorithm for the lossless compression of DNA files, which contain annotation text besides the nucleotide sequence. First a grammar is specifically designed to capture the regularities of the annotation text. A revertible transformation uses the grammar rules in order to equivalently represent the original file as a collection of parsed segments and a sequence of decisions made by the grammar parser. This decomposition enables the efficient use of state-of-the-art encoders for processing the parsed segments. The output size of the decision-making process of the grammar is optimized by extending the states to account for high-order Markovian dependencies. The practical implementation of the algorithm achieves a significant improvement when compared to the general-purpose methods currently used for DNA files."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4308","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
