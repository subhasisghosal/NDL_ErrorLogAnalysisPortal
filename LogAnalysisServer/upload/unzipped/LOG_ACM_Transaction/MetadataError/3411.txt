Throughput refers to the minimum achievable rate between a source-destination pair for a given routing mechanism and physical model, when the network is shared by Î˜(n) randomly chosen source-destination pairs. The main idea is to use a connectivity graph, which does not represent the actual physical network but rather the available communication resources. This graph also allows one to translate the problem of maximizing the throughput in ad hoc networks to the multicommodity flow problem and directly apply related results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21196","fieldValue":" We discuss how to automatically obtain the metric calibration of an ad hoc network of cameras with no centralized processor. We model the set of uncalibrated cameras as nodes in a communication network, and propose a distributed algorithm in which each camera performs a local, robust bundle adjustment over the camera parameters and scene points of its neighbors in an overlay â\u20ACœvision graph.â\u20AC? We analyze the performance of the algorithm on both simulated and real data, and show that the distributed algorithm results in a fairer allocation of messages per node while achieving comparable calibration accuracy to centralized bundle adjustment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21196","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21196","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21197","fieldValue":" DFuse is an architectural framework for dynamic application-specified data fusion in sensor networks. It bridges an important abstraction gap for developing advanced fusion applications that takes into account the dynamic nature of applications and sensor networks. Elements of the DFuse architecture include a fusion API, a distributed role assignment algorithm that dynamically adapts the placement of the application task graph on the network, and an abstraction migration facility that aids such dynamic role assignment. Experimental evaluations show that the API has low overhead, and simulation results show that the role assignment algorithm significantly increases the network lifetime over static placement."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21197","fieldValue":"ACM"}
