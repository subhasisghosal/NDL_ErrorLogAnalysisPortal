In contrast to this, there are instances on which 2-Opt may need an exponential number of steps to reach a local optimum. To understand why 2-Opt usually finds local optima quickly in experiments, we study its expected running time in the model of smoothed analysis, which can be considered as a less-pessimistic variant of worst-case analysis in which the adversarial input is subject to a small amount of random noise. In our probabilistic input model, an adversary chooses an arbitrary graph G and a probability density function for each edge according to which its length is chosen. We prove that in this model the expected number of local improvements is O(mnÏ\u2020 Ä\u2039 $16^&sqrt;ln m)&equals;m1+o(1)$nÏ\u2020, where n and m denote the number of vertices and edges of G, respectively, and Ï\u2020 denotes an upper bound on the density functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18540","fieldValue":" HFFT is a software package for solving the Helmholtz equation on bounded two- and three-dimensional rectangular domains with Dirichlet, Neumann, or periodic boundary conditions.

For a given threshold value, the modification allows a broader choice of block 2 X 2 pivots owing to a less restrictive pivoting condition. It also extends the range of permissible threshold values from [0, 1\/2) to [0, 0.6404). Moreover, the bound on element growth for stability consideration in the modified scheme is nearly the same as that of the original strategy."}
