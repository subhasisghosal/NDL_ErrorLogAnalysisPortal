All instances of the framework inherit machine-checked proofs of the metatheory such as compositionality and bisimulation congruence. We present a generic analysis tool for psi-calculus instances, enabling symbolic execution and (bi)simulation checking for both unicast and broadcast communication. The tool also provides a library for implementing new psi-calculus instances. We provide examples from traditional communication protocols and wireless sensor networks. We also describe the theoretical foundations of the tool, including an improved symbolic operational semantics, with additional support for scoped broadcast communication."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6887","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6887","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6888","fieldValue":"Hulst, A C Van"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6888","fieldValue":"Reniers, M A"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6888","fieldValue":"Fokkink, W J"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6888","fieldValue":" This article concerns the maximal synthesis for Hennessy-Milner Logic on Kripke structures with labeled transitions. We formally define, and prove the validity of, a theoretical framework that modifies a Kripke model to the least possible extent in order to satisfy a given HML formula. Applications of this work can be found in the field of controller synthesis and supervisory control for discrete-event systems. Synthesis is realized technically by first projecting the given Kripke model onto a bisimulation-equivalent partial tree representation, thereby unfolding up to the depth of the synthesized formula. Operational rules then define the required adaptations upon this structure in order to achieve validity of the synthesized formula. Synthesis might result in multiple valid adaptations, which are all related to the original model via simulation. Each simulant of the original Kripke model, which satisfies the synthesized formula, is also related to one of the synthesis results via simulation. This indicates maximality, or maximal permissiveness, in the context of supervisory control. In addition to the formal construction of synthesis as presented in this article, we present it in algorithmic form and analyze its computational complexity. Computer-verified proofs for two important theorems in this article have been created using the Coq proof assistant."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6889","fieldValue":" The main limitation of the verification approaches based on state enumeration is the state explosion problem. The partial order reduction techniques aim at attenuating this problem by reducing the number of transitions to be fired from each state while preserving properties of interest. Among the reduction techniques proposed in the literature, this article considers the stubborn set method of Petri nets and investigates its extension to time Petri nets. It establishes some useful sufficient conditions for stubborn sets, which preserve deadlocks and k-boundedness of places."}
