In this paper, we show that the performance of the classical support vector machine (SVM) algorithm can further be improved with the use of a custom-designed fuzzy membership function, for the partner-specific PPI interface prediction problem. We evaluated the performances of both classical SVM and fuzzy SVM (F-SVM) on the PPI databases of three different model proteomes of Homo sapiens, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces Cerevisiae and calculated the statistical significance of the developed F-SVM over classical SVM algorithm. We also compared our performance with the available state-of-the-art fuzzy methods in this domain and observed significant performance improvements. To predict interaction sites in protein complexes, local composition of amino acids together with their physico-chemical characteristics are used, where the F-SVM based prediction method exploits the membership function for each pair of sequence fragments. The average F-SVM performance (area under ROC curve) on the test samples in 10-fold cross validation experiment are measured as 77.07, 78.39, and 74.91 percent for the aforementioned organisms respectively. Performances on independent test sets are obtained as 72.09, 73.24 and 82.74 percent respectively.

While experimental methods can be quite successful, computational approaches can enhance discovery and guide experimentation by efficiently exploring very large design spaces. We present a computational algorithm, Predictably Profitable Path (PreProPath), to identify target pathways best suited for engineering modifications. The algorithm utilizes uncertainties about the metabolic networks operating state inherent in the underdetermined linear equations representing the stoichiometric model. Flux Variability Analysis is used to determine the operational flux range. PreProPath identifies a path that is predictable in behavior, exhibiting small flux ranges, and profitable, containing the least restrictive flux-limiting reaction in the network. The algorithm is computationally efficient because it does not require enumeration of pathways. The results of case studies show that PreProPath can efficiently analyze variances in metabolic states and model uncertainties to suggest pathway engineering strategies that have been previously supported by experimental data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5272","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5272","fieldValue":"PreProPath: An Uncertainty-Aware Algorithm for Identifying Predictable Profitable Pathways in Biochemical Networks"}
