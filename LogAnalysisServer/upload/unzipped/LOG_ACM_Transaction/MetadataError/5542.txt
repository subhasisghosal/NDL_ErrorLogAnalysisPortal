The replicated measurements for the same object are correlated, and this correlation must be carefully dealt with in scientific analysis. In this paper, we propose a robust Bayesian mixture model for clustering data sets with replicated measurements. The model aims not only to accurately cluster the data points taking the replicated measurements into consideration, but also to find the outliers (i.e., scattered objects) which are possibly required to be studied further. A tree-structured variational Bayes (VB) algorithm is developed to carry out model fitting. Experimental studies showed that our model compares favorably with the infinite Gaussian mixture model, while maintaining computational simplicity. We demonstrate the benefits of including the replicated measurements in the model, in terms of improved outlier detection rates in varying measurement uncertainty conditions. Finally, we apply the approach to clustering biological transcriptomics mRNA expression data sets with replicated measurements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4832","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4832","fieldValue":"Clustering algorithms,Robustness,Biological system modeling,Bayesian methods,Tin,Approximation methods,Data models,gene expression data.,Replicated measurement,clustering,robust clustering,outlier detection,variational Bayes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4833","fieldValue":"Chen, Zhi-Zhong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4833","fieldValue":" We give a fixed-parameter algorithm for the problem of enumerating all minimum-cost LCA-reconciliations involving gene duplications, gene losses, and lateral gene transfers (LGTs) for a given species tree S and a given gene tree G. Our algorithm can work for the weighted version of the problem, where the costs of a gene duplication, a gene loss, and an LGT are left to the user's discretion. The algorithm runs in O(m+3^{k\/c} n) time, where m is the number of vertices in S, n is the number of vertices in G, c is the smaller between a gene duplication cost and an LGT cost, and k is the minimum cost of an LCA-reconciliation between S and G. The time complexity is indeed better if the cost of a gene loss is greater than 0. In particular, when the cost of a gene loss is at least 0.614c, the running time of the algorithm is O(m+2.78^{k\/c}n)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4833","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4833","fieldValue":"Vegetation,Law,Algorithm design and analysis,Computational biology,Bioinformatics,Biological system modeling,fixed-parameter algorithms.,Phylogenetic trees,reconciliations"}
