Our approach builds on the idea of implicit skinning in which the character is approximated by a 3D scalar field and mesh-vertices are appropriately re-projected. Instead of being bound by an initial skinning solution used to initialize the shape at each time step, we use the skin mesh to directly track iso-surfaces of the field over time. Technical problems are two-fold: firstly, all contact surfaces generated between skin parts should be captured as iso-surfaces of the implicit field; secondly, the tracking method should capture elastic skin effects when the joints bend, and as the character returns to its rest shape, so the skin must follow. Our solutions include: new composition operators enabling blending effects and local self-contact between implicit surfaces, as well as a tangential relaxation scheme derived from the as-rigid-as possible energy to solve the tracking problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2627","fieldValue":" The central goal of data stream algorithms is to process massive streams of data using sublinear storage space. Motivated by work in the database community on outsourcing database and data stream processing, we ask whether the space usage of such algorithms can be further reduced by enlisting a more powerful â\u20ACœhelperâ\u20AC? that can annotate the stream as it is read. We do not wish to blindly trust the helper, so we require that the algorithm be convinced of having computed a correct answer. We show upper bounds that achieve a nontrivial tradeoff between the amount of annotation used and the space required to verify it. We also prove lower bounds on such tradeoffs, often nearly matching the upper bounds, via notions related to Merlin-Arthur communication complexity. Our results cover the classic data stream problems of selection, frequency moments, and fundamental graph problems such as triangle-freeness and connectivity. Our work is also part of a growing trendâ\u20AC\u201Dincluding recent studies of multipass streaming, read\/write streams, and randomly ordered streamsâ\u20AC\u201Dof asking more complexity-theoretic questions about data stream processing. It is a recognition that, in addition to practical relevance, the data stream model raises many interesting theoretical questions in its own right."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2627","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2627","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17193","fieldValue":" Smooth space deformation has become a vital tool for the animation and design of 2D and 3D shapes. Linear methods, under the umbrella term of \"linear blend skinning\", are the de facto standard for 3D animations. Unfortunately such approaches do not trivially extend to deforming vector graphics, such as the cubic BÃ©zier splines prevalent in 2D or subdivision surfaces in 3D. We propose a variational approach to reposition the control points of cubic BÃ©zier splines and Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces---or any linear subdivision curves or surfaces---to produce curves or surfaces which match a linear blend skinning deformation as closely as possible. Exploiting the linearity of linear blend skinning, we show how this optimization collapses neatly into the repeated multiplication of a matrix per handle. We support $C^0, C1, G1$, and fixed-angle continuity constraints between adjacent BÃ©zier curves in a spline. Complexity scales linearly with respect to the number of input curves and run-time performance is fast enough for real-time editing and animation of high-resolution shapes."}
