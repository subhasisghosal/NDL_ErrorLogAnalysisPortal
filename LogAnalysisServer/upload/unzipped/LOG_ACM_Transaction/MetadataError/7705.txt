{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10222","fieldValue":" Application-layer multicast (ALM) has recently emerged as a promising solution for diverse group-oriented applications. Unlike dedicated routers in IP multicast, the autonomous end-hosts are generally unreliable and even selfish. A strategic host might cheat about its private information to affect protocol execution and, in turn, to improve its individual benefit. Specifically, in a link-weighted ALM protocol where the hosts measure the distances from their neighbors and accordingly construct the ALM topology, a selfish end-host can easily intercept the measurement message and exaggerate the distances to other nodes, so as to reduce the probability of being a relay. Such distance cheating, rarely happening in IP multicast, can significantly impact the efficiency and stability of the ALM topology. To defend against this kind of cheating, we present a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)-based cheat-proof mechanism in this paper. We demonstrate a practical mapping from the utility, payment, and welfare of a VCG mechanism to the link-weighted ALM context. Based on this, we further discuss practical issues for implementing the cheat-proof mechanism--specifically, a trustworthy distributed algorithm for payment computation. Performance analyses show that the overheads of the computation, storage, and communication of our implementation are controlled at low levels, and extensive simulations further testify the implementation's effectiveness. Although there are other similar studies in this area, the contribution of our cheat-proof mechanism and its implementation primarily lies in two aspects. On one hand, we first explicitly solve the distance cheating problem in link-weighted ALM since its proposal by mapping the VCG mechanism to link-weighted ALM context. On the other hand, our distributed implementation can not only effectively defend against distance cheating, but can also avoid the potential cheating behaviors when selfish ALM nodes fulfill the cheat-proof mechanism itself."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10222","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10222","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10222","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10223","fieldValue":" In this paper, we formulate a delay-power control (DPC) scheme for wireless networking, which efficiently balances delay against transmitter power on each wireless link. The DPC scheme is scalable, as each link autonomously updates its power based on the interference observed at its receiver; no cross-link communication is required. It is shown that DPC converges to a unique equilibrium power and several key properties are established, concerning the nature of channel bandwidth sharing achieved by the links. The DPC scheme is contrasted to the well-known Foschini-Miljanic (FM) formulation for transmitter power control in wireless networks, and some key advantages are established. Based on the DPC and FM schemes, two protocols are developed, which leverage adaptive tuning of DPC parameters. One of them is inspired by TCP and exhibits analogous behavior. This paper primarily focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of DPC and their practical implications for efficient protocol design. The DPC dynamics are also investigated numerically."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10223","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10223","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10223","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10224","fieldValue":" We demonstrate that CSMA\/CA networks, including IEEE 802.11 networks, exhibit severe fairness problem in many scenarios, where some hosts obtain most of the channel's bandwidth while others starve. Most existing solutions require nodes to overhear transmissions made by contending nodes and, based on the overheard information, adjust local rates to achieve fairness among all contending links. Their underlying assumption is that transmissions made by contending nodes can be overheard. However, this assumption holds only when the transmission range is equal to the interference range, which is not true in reality. As our study reveals, the overhearing-based solutions, as well as several nonoverhearing AIMD solutions, cannot achieve MAC-layer fairness in various settings. We propose a new rate control protocol, called Proportional Increase Synchronized multiplicative Decrease (PISD). Without relying on overhearing, it provides fairness in CSMA\/CA networks, particularly IEEE 802.11 networks, by using only local information and performing localized operations. It combines several novel rate control mechanisms, including synchronized multiplicative decrease, proportional increase, and background transmission. We prove that PISD converges and achieves (weighted) fairness. We further introduce Queue Spreading (QS) to achieve MAC-layer fairness when there are multiple contention groups, in which case PISD will fail."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10224","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
