Due to the combinatorial complexity of these networks, as well as the advances in the level of detail to which they can be reconstructed, an exhaustive enumeration of all EMs is often not practical. Therefore, in recent years interest has shifted towards searching EMs with specific properties. We present a novel method that allows computing EMs containing a given set of target reactions. This generalizes previous algorithms where the set of target reactions consists of a single reaction. In the one-reaction case, our method compares favorably to the previous approaches. In addition, we present several applications of our algorithm for computing EMs containing two target reactions in genome-scale metabolic networks.

Earlier research has established that sites of replication origin are dominated by high concentration of rare palindrome sequences of DNA. Computational methods are devised based on scoring to determine the concentration of palindromes. In this paper, we propose both extraction and localization of rare palindromes in an automated manner. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT-II), a widely recognized image compression algorithm is utilized here to extract palindromic sequences based on their reverse complimentary symmetry property of existence. We formulate a novel approach to localize the rare palindrome clusters by devising a Minimum Quadratic Entropy (MQE) measure based on the Renyi's Quadratic Entropy (RQE) function. Experimental results over a large number of herpesvirus genomes show that the RQE based scoring of rare palindromes have higher order of sensitivity, and lesser false alarm in detecting concentration of rare palindromes and thereby sites of replication origin."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5117","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5117","fieldValue":"Detection of replication origin sites in herpesvirus genomes by clustering and scoring of palindromes with quadratic entropy measures"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5117","fieldValue":"ACM"}
