An alternative retrieval method is to rank passages, that is, short fragments of documents, a strategy that can improve effectiveness and identify relevant material in documents that are too large for users to consider as a whole. However, ranking of passages can considerably increase retrieval costs. In this article we explore alternative query evaluation techniques, and develop new tecnhiques for evaluating queries on passages. We show experimentally that, appropriately implemented, effective passage retrieval is practical in limited memory on a desktop machine. Compared to passage ranking with adaptations of current document ranking algorithms, our new â\u20ACœDO-TOSâ\u20AC? passage-ranking algorithm requires only a fraction of the resources, at the cost of a small loss of effectiveness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23813","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23813","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23814","fieldValue":"Van Rijsbergen, C.

Using a methodology of forming artifically ambiguous words, known as pseudowords, and through reference to other researchers' work, the analysis illustrates that the distribution of the frequency of occurrance of the senses of a word plays a strong role in ambiguity's impact of effectiveness. Further investigation shows that this analysis may also be applicable to other processes of retrieval, such as Cross Language Information Retrieval, query expansion, retrieval of OCR'ed texts, and stemming. The analysis appears to provide a means of explaining, at least in part, reasons for the processes' impact (or lack of it) on effectiveness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23814","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23814","fieldValue":"ACM"}
