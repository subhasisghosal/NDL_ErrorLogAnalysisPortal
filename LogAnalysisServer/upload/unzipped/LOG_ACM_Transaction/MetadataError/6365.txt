The trend is to model an application independently from the architecture, then the model is morphed to best fit the target architecture. One downplayed aspect is the mapping of communications through the on-chip topology. The cost of such communications is often prevalent with regard to computations. This article establishes a dataflow process network called K-periodically Routed Graph (KRG), which serves the role of representing the various routing decisions during the transformation of a genuine application into a architecture-aware version for this application."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6926","fieldValue":"Davis, Robert I"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6926","fieldValue":"Petters, Stefan M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6926","fieldValue":" This article introduces schedulability analysis for Global Fixed Priority Scheduling with Deferred Preemption (gFPDS) for homogeneous multiprocessor systems. gFPDS is a superset of Global Fixed Priority Preemptive Scheduling (gFPPS) and Global Fixed Priority Nonpreemptive Scheduling (gFPNS). We show how schedulability can be improved using gFPDS via appropriate choice of priority assignment and final nonpreemptive region lengths, and provide algorithms that optimize schedulability in this way. Via an experimental evaluation we compare the performance of multiprocessor scheduling using global approaches: gFPDS, gFPPS, and gFPNS, and also partitioned approaches employing FPDS, FPPS, and FPNS on each processor."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6926","fieldValue":"ACM"}
