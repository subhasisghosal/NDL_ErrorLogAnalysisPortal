Most of this research has focused on single-party communication (monologs), such as the way in which individuals either give or follow route instructions. However, very little work has been reported on spatial navigation dialogs and whether there are gender differences in the way that they are conducted. This article will address the lack of research evidence by exploring the dialogs between partners of the same and of different gender in a simulated Human-Robot Interaction study. In the experiments discussed in this article, pairs of participants communicated remotely; in each pair, one participant (the instructor) was under the impression that s\/he was giving route instructions to a robot (the follower), avoiding any perception of gendered communication. To ensure the naturalness of the interaction, the followers were given no guidelines on what to say, however, each had to control a robot based on the user's instructions. While many monologe-based studies suggest male superiority in a multitude of spatial activities and domains, this study of dialogs highlights a more complex pattern of results. As anticipated, gender influences task performance and communication. However, the findings suggest that it is the interactionâ\u20AC\u201Dthe combination of gender and role (i.e., instructor or follower)â\u20AC\u201Dthat has the most significant impact. In particular, pairs of female users\/instructors and male â\u20ACœrobotsâ\u20AC?\/followers are associated with the fastest and most accurate completion of the navigation tasks. Moreover, dialoge-based analysis illustrates how pairs of male users\/instructors and female â\u20ACœrobotsâ\u20AC?\/followers achieved successful communication through â\u20ACœalignmentâ\u20AC? of spatial descriptions. In particular, males seem to adapt the content of their instructions when interacting with female â\u20ACœrobotsâ\u20AC?\/followers and employ more landmark references compared to female users\/instructors or when addressing males (in male-male pairings). This study describes the differences in how males and females interact with the system, and proposes that any female â\u20ACœdisadvantageâ\u20AC? in spatial communication can disappear through interactive mechanisms. Such insights are important for the design of navigation systems that are equally effective for users of either gender."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5785","fieldValue":"Are we there yet?: The role of gender on the effectiveness and efficiency of user-robot communication in navigational tasks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5786","fieldValue":" Despite decades of research into how professional programmers debug, only recently has work emerged about how end-user programmers attempt to debug programs. Without this knowledge, we cannot build tools to adequately support their needs. This article reports the results of a detailed qualitative empirical study of end-user programmers' sensemaking about a spreadsheet's correctness. Using our study's data, we derived a sensemaking model for end-user debugging and categorized participants' activities and verbalizations according to this model, allowing us to investigate how participants went about debugging. Among the results are identification of the prevalence of information foraging during end-user debugging, two successful strategies for traversing the sensemaking model, potential ties to gender differences in the literature, sensemaking sequences leading to debugging progress, and sequences tied with troublesome points in the debugging process. The results also reveal new implications for the design of spreadsheet tools to support end-user programmers' sensemaking during debugging."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1486","fieldValue":" Perceptual evaluation is still the most common method in clinical practice for diagnosing and following the progression of the condition of people with speech disorders. Although a number of studies have addressed the acoustic analysis of speech productions exhibiting impairments, additional descriptive analysis is required to manage interperson variability, considering speakers with the same condition or across different conditions. In this context, this article investigates automatic speech processing approaches dedicated to the detection and localization of abnormal acoustic phenomena in speech signal produced by people with speech disorders. This automatic process aims at enhancing the manual investigation of human experts while at the same time reducing the extent of their intervention by calling their attention to specific parts of the speech considered as atypical from an acoustical point of view. Two different approaches are proposed in this article. The first approach models only the normal speech, whereas the second models both normal and dysarthric speech. Both approaches are evaluated following two strategies: one consists of a strict phone comparison between a human annotation of abnormal phones and the automatic output, while the other uses a â\u20ACœone-phone delayâ\u20AC? for the comparison. The experimental evaluation of both approaches for the task of detecting acoustic anomalies was conducted on two different corpora composed of French dysarthric speakers and control speakers. These approaches obtain very encouraging results and their potential for clinical uses with different types of dysarthria and neurological diseases is quite promising."}
