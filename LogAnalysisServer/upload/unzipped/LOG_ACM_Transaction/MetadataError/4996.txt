However, state-of-the-art language recognition systems usually do not use this information. In this research, a non-negative factor analysis (NFA) approach is developed for GMM weight decomposition and adaptation. This modeling, which is conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive, suggests a new low-dimensional utterance representation method using a factor analysis similar to that of the i-vector framework. The obtained subspace vectors are then applied in conjunction with i-vectors to the language\/dialect recognition problem. The suggested approach is evaluated on the NIST 2011 and RATS language recognition evaluation (LRE) corpora and on the QCRI Arabic dialect recognition evaluation (DRE) corpus. The assessment results show that the proposed adaptation method yields more accurate recognition results compared to three conventional weight adaptation approaches, namely maximum likelihood re-estimation, non-negative matrix factorization, and a subspace multinomial model. Experimental results also show that the intermediate-level fusion of i-vectors and NFA subspace vectors improves the performance of the state-of-the-art i-vector framework especially for the case of short utterances."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3667","fieldValue":"Non-negative factor analysis of Gaussian mixture model weight adaptation for language and dialect recognition"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3667","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3667","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3668","fieldValue":" This paper presents a novel dictionary learning (DL) method to improve the performance of sparsity based single-channel speech separation (SCSS). The conventional approaches regard the sub-dictionaries as independent units and learn sub-dictionaries separately in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain using their corresponding training sets respectively. However, we take the relationship between the sub-dictionaries into account and optimize the sub-dictionaries jointly in the time domain. By satisfying a designed discrimination constraint, a structured dictionary, whose atoms have better correspondences to the speaker labels, is learned so that the sources can be recovered by the corresponding reconstruction after sparse coding. An algorithm, which consists of sparse coding stage and dictionary updating stage, is proposed to deal with this DL optimization problem. Two strategies, i.e., direct learning and adaptive learning, are presented to select the training sets which are used to learn the discriminative dictionary. Experimental results show that the proposed SCSS algorithms have superior performance compared with other tested approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3669","fieldValue":" The detection of early reflections in room impulse responses is of importance to many algorithms including room geometry inference, mixing time determination and speech dereverberation. The detection of early reflections can be hampered by increasing reflection width, as the direct sound undergoes reflection and by overlapping of the reflections, as the reflection density grows. This paper investigates the use of Dynamic Time Warping upon a direct sound pulse to estimate the temporal distribution of arrivals in room impulse responses. Bounded Dynamic Time Warping is performed, after an initial correlation of the direct sound with the remaining signal, to further refine the arrival's location and duration and to find arrivals which may otherwise not correlate well with the un-warped direct sound due to a change in the reflection's shape. Dynamic Time Warping upon concatenated versions of the direct sound is also used to help find overlapping reflections which may otherwise go undetected. Warping is performed via a set of warp matrices which can be combined together and can also be inverted via a quickly calculated left pseudo-inverse. The algorithm presented is compared to two current methods of arrival detection and is shown to detect a lesser number of spurious arrivals than either of these algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3669","fieldValue":"ACM"}
