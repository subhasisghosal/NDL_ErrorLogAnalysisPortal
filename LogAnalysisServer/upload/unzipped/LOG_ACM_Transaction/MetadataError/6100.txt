{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6278","fieldValue":" IP integration, which is one of the most important SoC design steps, requires taking into account communication and timing constraints. In that context, design and reuse can be improved using IP cores described at a high abstraction level. In this paper, we present an IP design approach that relies on three main phases: (1) constraint modeling, (2) IP constraint analysis steps for feasibility checking, and (3) synthesis. We propose a set of techniques dedicated to the digital signal processing domain that lead to an optimized IP core integration. Based on a generic architecture of components, the method we propose provides automatic generation of IP cores designed under integration constraints. We show the effectiveness of our approach with a DCT core design case study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6278","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6278","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6279","fieldValue":"Al-Hashimi, Bashir M."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6279","fieldValue":"CortS, Luis A."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6279","fieldValue":" This paper addresses the interrelation between control and data flow in embedded system models through a new design representation, called Dual Flow Net (DFN). A modeling formalism with a very close-fitting control and data flow is achieved by this representation, as a consequence of enhancing its underlying Petri net structure. The work presented in this paper does not only tackle the modeling side in embedded systems design, but also the validation of embedded system models through formal methods. Various introductory examples illustrate the applicability of the DFN principles, whereas the capability of the model to with complex designs is demonstrated through the design and verification of a real-life Ethernet coprocessor."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6279","fieldValue":"CTL"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6279","fieldValue":"LTL"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6279","fieldValue":"ACM"}
