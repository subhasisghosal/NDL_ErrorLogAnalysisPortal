Clearly, this problem is at least as hard as the usual (non-st) version. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for the product-demands setting that produces a cut of sparsity O(&sqrt;OPT), where OPT &les; 1 denotes the optimum when the total edge capacity and the total demand are assumed (by normalization) to be 1. Our result generalizes the recent work of Trevisan [arXiv, 2013] for the non-st version of the same problem (sparsest cut with product demands), which in turn generalizes the bound achieved by the discrete Cheeger inequality, a cornerstone of Spectral Graph Theory that has numerous applications. Indeed, Cheegerâ\u20AC™s inequality handles graph conductance, the special case of product demands that are proportional to the vertex (capacitated) degrees. Along the way, we obtain an O(log &verbar;V&verbar;) approximation for the general-demands setting of sparsest st-cut."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2745","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2745","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18576","fieldValue":" An algorithm to generate variates having a gamma distribution with shape parameter greater than one is presented in this paper.
