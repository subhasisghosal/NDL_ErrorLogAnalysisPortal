{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12052","fieldValue":" This paper describes the concepts underlying an alternative link-level protocol for broadband local networks. The protocol uses implicit slotting of the contention channel to support larger networks, improve performance, and provide reliable distributed collision recognition without reinforcement. It is designed such that compatible interfaces to existing CSMA\/CD-based systems can be provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12052","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12052","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12053","fieldValue":" The concept of an information structure is introduced as a unifying principle behind several of the numerous algorithms that have been proposed for the distributed mutual exclusion problem. This approach allows the development of a generalized mutual exclusion algorithm that accepts a particular information structure at initialization and realizes both known and new algorithms as special cases. Two simple performance metrics of a realized algorithm can be obtained directly from the information structure. A new failure recovery mechanism called local recovery, which requires no coordination between nodes and no additional messages beyond that needed for failure detection, is introduced."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12053","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12053","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12054","fieldValue":" This paper develops an analytical model for cache-reload transients and compares the model to observations based on several address traces. The cache-reload transient is the set of cache misses that occur when a process is reinitiated after being suspended temporarily. For example, an interrupt program that runs periodically experiences a reload transient at each initiation. The reload transient depends on the cache size and on the sizes of the footprints in the cache of the competing programs, where a program footprint is defined to be the set of lines in the cache in active use by the program. The model shows that the size of the transient is related to the normal distribution function. A simulation based on program-address traces shows excellent agreement between the model and the observations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12054","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12054","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12055","fieldValue":" The 1980s have witnessed the emergence of a new architecture for computing based on networks of personal computer workstations. The performance requirements of such systems of workstations places a strain on traditional approaches to network architecture. The integration of diverse systems into this environment introduces functional compatibility issues that are not present in homogeneous networks. Effective prescriptions for functional compatibility, therefore, must go beyond the communication paradigms used in present distributed systems, such as remote procedure calls.This paper proposes a distributed system architecture in which communication follows a programming paradigm. In this architecture a programming language provides remote service interfaces for the heterogeneous distributed system environment. This language is a flexible and efficient medium for implementing service function protocols. In essence, clients and servers communicate by programming one another."}
