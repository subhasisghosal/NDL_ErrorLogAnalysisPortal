{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17465","fieldValue":" The field of topology optimization seeks to optimize shapes under structural objectives, such as achieving the most rigid shape using a given quantity of material. Besides optimal shape design, these methods are increasingly popular as design tools, since they automatically produce structures having desirable physical properties, a task hard to perform by hand even for skilled designers. However, there is no simple way to control the appearance of the generated objects. In this paper, we propose to optimize shapes for both their structural properties and their appearance, the latter being controlled by a user-provided pattern example. These two objectives are challenging to combine, as optimal structural properties fully define the shape, leaving no degrees of freedom for appearance. We propose a new formulation where appearance is optimized as an objective while structural properties serve as constraints. This produces shapes with sufficient rigidity while allowing enough freedom for the appearance of the final structure to resemble the input exemplar. Our approach generates rigid shapes using a specified quantity of material while observing optional constraints such as voids, fills, attachment points, and external forces. The appearance is defined by examples, making our technique accessible to casual users. We demonstrate its use in the context of fabrication using a laser cutter to manufacture real objects from optimized shapes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17465","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17465","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17466","fieldValue":" There is a growing expectation for high performance design in architecture which negotiates between the requirements of the client and the physical constraints of a building site. Clients for building projects often challenge architects to maximize view quality since it can significantly increase real estate value. To pursue this challenge, architects typically move through several design revision cycles to identify a set of design options which satisfy these view quality expectations in coordination with other goals of the project. However, reviewing a large quantity of design options within the practical time constraints is challenging due to the limitations of existing tools for view performance evaluation. These challenges include flexibility in the definition of view quality and the ability to handle the expensive computation involved in assessing both the view quality and the exploration of a large number of possible design options. To address these challenges, we propose a catalogue-based framework that enables the interactive exploration of conceptual building design options based on adjustable view preferences. We achieve this by integrating a flexible mechanism to combine different view measures with an indexing scheme for view computation that achieves high performance and precision. Furthermore, the combined view measures are then used to model the building design space as a high dimensional scalar function. The topological features of this function are then used as candidate building designs. Finally, we propose an interactive design catalogue for the exploration of potential building designs based on the given view preferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two use case scenarios to assess view potential and explore conceptual building designs on sites with high development likelihood in Manhattan, New York City."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2652","fieldValue":"Di Battista, Giuseppe"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2652","fieldValue":" We study the following problem: given a planar graph G and a planar drawing (embedding) of a subgraph of G, can such a drawing be extended to a planar drawing of the entire graph G&quest; This problem fits the paradigm of extending a partial solution for a problem to a complete one, which has been studied before in many different settings. Unlike many cases, in which the presence of a partial solution in the input makes an otherwise easy problem hard, we show that the planarity question remains polynomial-time solvable. Our algorithm is based on several combinatorial lemmas, which show that the planarity of partially embedded graphs exhibits the â\u20AC˜TONCASâ\u20AC™ behavior â\u20ACœthe obvious necessary conditions for planarity are also sufficient.â\u20AC? These conditions are expressed in terms of the interplay between (1) the rotation system and containment relationships between cycles and (2) the decomposition of a graph into its connected, biconnected, and triconnected components. This implies that no dynamic programming is needed for a decision algorithm and that the elements of the decomposition can be processed independently. Further, by equipping the components of the decomposition with suitable data structures and by carefully splitting the problem into simpler subproblems, we make our algorithm run in linear time. Finally, we consider several generalizations of the problem, such as minimizing the number of edges of the partial embedding that need to be rerouted to extend it, and argue that they are NP-hard. We also apply our algorithm to the simultaneous graph drawing problem Simultaneous Embedding with Fixed Edges (Sefe). There we obtain a linear-time algorithm for the case that one of the input graphs or the common graph has a fixed planar embedding."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2652","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2652","fieldValue":"ACM"}
