Process variability impacts the optimization of the target system metrics, that is, performance and energy consumption by introducing fluctuations and unpredictability. Besides, it impacts the parametric yield of the chip with respect to application level constraints by reducing the number of devices working within normal operating conditions. The impact of variability on systems with stringent application-specific requirements (such as portable multimedia and critical embedded systems) is much greater than on general-purpose systems given the emphasis on predictability and reduced operating margins. In this market segment, failing to address such a problem within the early design stages of the chip may lead to missing market deadlines and suffering greater economic losses. In the context of a design space exploration framework for supporting the platform-based design approach, we address the problem of robustness with respect to manufacturing process variations. First, we apply Response Surface Modeling (RSM) techniques to enable an efficient evaluation of the statistical measures of execution time and energy consumption for each system configuration. Then, we apply a robust design space exploration framework to afford the problem of the impact of manufacturing process variations onto the system-level metrics and consequently onto the application-level constraints. We finally provide a comparison of our design space exploration technique with conventional approaches on two different case studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6536","fieldValue":"A Variability-Aware Robust Design Space Exploration Methodology for On-Chip Multiprocessors Subject to Application-Specific Constraints"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6536","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6536","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6537","fieldValue":" This article presents a low-power decoder design for joint source-channel decoding (JSCD) based on a novel unequal error protection (UEP) scheme over additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Conventional JSCD schemes, adopting low-density parity check (LDPC) codes for multimedia devices, typically operate at a fixed-time decoding loop, regardless of the quality of data received. We present a JSCD scheme that achieves reduction in power through minimum energy decoding and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). Consequently, up to 39&percnt; power reduction is achieved in Foreman, Akiyo, and Mobile video streams without performance degradation in reconstructed video quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6537","fieldValue":"LDPC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1600","fieldValue":" The impact of pipeline length on both the power and performance of a microprocessor is explored both by theory and by simulation. A theory is presented for a range of power\/performance metrics, $BIPS^m\/W. The theory shows that the more important power is to the metric, the shorter the optimum pipeline length that results. For typical parameters neither BIPS\/W nor BIPS2\/W yield an optimum, i.e., a non-pipelined design is optimal. For BIPS3$\/W the optimum, averaged over all 55 workloads studied, occurs at a 22.5 FO4 design point, a 7 stage pipeline, but this value is highly dependent on the assumed growth in latch count with pipeline depth. As dynamic power grows, the optimal design point shifts to shorter pipelines. Clock gating pushes the optimum to deeper pipelines. Surprisingly, as leakage power grows, the optimum is also found to shift to deeper pipelines. The optimum pipeline depth varies for different classes of workloads: SPEC95 and SPEC2000 integer applications, traditional (legacy) database and on-line transaction processing applications, modern (e. g. web) applications, and floating point applications."}
