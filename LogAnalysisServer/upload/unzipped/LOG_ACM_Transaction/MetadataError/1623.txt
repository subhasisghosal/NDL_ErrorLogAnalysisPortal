However, producing sample sets with desired efficiency and blue noise statistics has been a major challenge, as existing methods are either sequential with limited speed, or are parallel but only through pre-computed datasets and thus fall short in producing samples with blue noise statistics. We present a Poisson disk sampling algorithm that runs in parallel and produces all samples on the fly with desired blue noise properties. Our main idea is to subdivide the sample domain into grid cells and we draw samples concurrently from multiple cells that are sufficiently far apart so that their samples cannot conflict one another. We present a parallel implementation of our algorithm running on a GPU with constant cost per sample and constant number of computation passes for a target number of samples. Our algorithm also works in arbitrary dimension, and allows adaptive sampling from a user-specified importance field. Furthermore, our algorithm is simple and easy to implement, and runs faster than existing techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15892","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15892","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15893","fieldValue":" We introduce a new tool to solve the large linear systems arising from gradient-domain image processing. Specifically, we develop a streaming multigrid solver, which needs just two sequential passes over out-of-core data. This fast solution is enabled by a combination of three techniques: (1) use of second-order finite elements (rather than traditional finite differences) to reach sufficient accuracy in a single V-cycle, (2) temporally blocked relaxation, and (3) multi-level streaming to pipeline the restriction and prolongation phases into single streaming passes. A key contribution is the extension of the B-spline finite-element method to be compatible with the forward-difference gradient representation commonly used with images. Our streaming solver is also efficient for in-memory images, due to its fast convergence and excellent cache behavior. Remarkably, it can outperform spatially adaptive solvers that exploit application-specific knowledge. We demonstrate seamless stitching and tone-mapping of gigapixel images in about an hour on a notebook PC."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15894","fieldValue":"Lee, Sung-Hee"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15894","fieldValue":" Spline joints are a novel class of joints that can model general scleronomic constraints for multibody dynamics based on the minimal-coordinates formulation. The main idea is to introduce spline curves and surfaces in the modeling of joints: We model 1-DOF joints using splines on SE(3), and construct multi-DOF joints as the product of exponentials of splines in Euclidean space. We present efficient recursive algorithms to compute the derivatives of the spline joint, as well as geometric algorithms to determine optimal parameters in order to achieve the desired joint motion. Our spline joints can be used to create interesting new simulated mechanisms for computer animation and they can more accurately model complex biomechanical joints such as the knee and shoulder."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15894","fieldValue":"ACM"}
