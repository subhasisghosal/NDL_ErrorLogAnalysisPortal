Both CMsTand CMST problems are NP-hard. In this article, we presentapproximation algorithms for these problems and several of theirvariants in network design. Our main results are the following:---We present a (Â³ $Ã?_ST +2)-approximation algorithm for the CMStT problem, where Â³ isthe inverse Steiner ratio, and Ã?STis the best achievable approximation ratio for the Steiner treeproblem. Our ratio improves the current best ratio of2Ã?ST + 2 for this problem.---In particular, we obtain (Â³ + 2)-approximation ratio forthe CMST problem, which is an improvement over the current bestratio of 4 for this problem. For points in Euclidean andrectilinear planes, our result translates into ratios of 3.1548 and3.5, respectively.---For instances in the plane, under theLp norm, with the vertices in Dhaving uniform weights, we present a nontrivial(7\/5Ã?ST + 3\/2)-approximation algorithm forthe CMStT problem. This translates into a ratio of 2.9 for the CMSTproblem with uniform vertex weights in theLp$metric plane. Our ratio of 2.9 solvesthe long-standing open problem of obtaining any ratio better than 3for this case.---For the CMST problem, we show how to obtain a 2-approximationfor graphs in metric spaces with unit vertex weights and k =3,4.---For the budgeted CMST problem, in which the weights ofthe subtrees connected to r could be up to Â± kinstead of k (Â± e 1), we obtain a ratio of Â³&plus; 2\/Â±."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2200","fieldValue":"Approximation algorithms for the capacitated minimum spanning tree problem and its variants in network design"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2200","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2200","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12543","fieldValue":" For a finite set Î\u201C of Boolean relations, Max Ones SAT(Î\u201C) and Exact Ones SAT(Î\u201C) are generalized satisfiability problems where every constraint relation is from Î\u201C, and the task is to find a satisfying assignment with at least\/exactly k variables set to 1, respectively.
