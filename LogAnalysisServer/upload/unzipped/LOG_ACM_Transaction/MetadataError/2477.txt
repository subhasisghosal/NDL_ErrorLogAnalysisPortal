Given an n-vertex undirected graph G &equals; (V, E) and a parameter k &equals; 1, 2, ‚\u20AC¶, their oracle has size $O(kn^1 + 1\/k), and upon a query (u, v) it constructs a path Œ† between u and v of length Œ\u201D(u, v) such that $d_G(u, v) &les; Œ\u201D(u, v) &les; (2k ‚à\u2019 1)dG$(u, v). The query time of the oracle from Thorup and Zwick [2001a] is O(k) (in addition to the length of the returned path), and it was subsequently improved to O(1) [Wulff-Nilsen 2012; Chechik 2014]. A major drawback of the oracle of Thorup and Zwick [2001a] is that its space is Œ©(n ¬∑ logn). Mendel and Naor [2006] devised an oracle with space O(n1 + 1\/k) and stretch O(k), but their oracle can only report distance estimates and not actual paths. In this article, we devise a path-reporting distance oracle with size O(n1 + 1\/k), stretch O(k), and query time O(n&epsi;), for an arbitrarily small constant &epsi; > 0. In particular, for k &equals; logn, our oracle provides logarithmic stretch using linear size. Another variant of our oracle has size O(nloglogn), polylogarithmic stretch, and query time O(loglogn). For unweighted graphs, we devise a distance oracle with multiplicative stretch O(1), additive stretch O(Œ≤(k)), for a function Œ≤(¬∑), space O(n1 + 1\/k), and query time O(n&epsi;), for an arbitrarily small constant &epsi; > 0. The tradeoff between multiplicative stretch and size in these oracles is far below Erd≈\u2018s‚\u20ACôs girth conjecture threshold (which is stretch 2k ‚à\u2019 1 and size O(n1 + 1\/k)). Breaking the girth conjecture tradeoff is achieved by exhibiting a tradeoff of different nature between additive stretch Œ≤(k) and size O(n1 + 1\/k$). A similar type of tradeoff was exhibited by a construction of (1 + &epsi;, Œ≤)-spanners due to Elkin and Peleg [2001]. However, so far (1 + &epsi;, Œ≤)-spanners had no counterpart in the distance oracles‚\u20ACô world. An important novel tool that we develop on the way to these results is a distance-preserving path-reporting oracle. We believe that this oracle is of independent interest."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2724","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2724","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18378","fieldValue":"A Quantitative Evaluation of the Feasibility of, and Suitable Hardware Architectures for, an Adaptive, Parallel Finite-Element System"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18378","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18378","fieldValue":"ACM"}
