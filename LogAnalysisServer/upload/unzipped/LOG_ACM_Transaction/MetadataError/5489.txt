{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4740","fieldValue":" The analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments is important for discovering the biological process of genes. Biclustering algorithms have been proven to be able to group the genes with similar expression patterns under a number of experimental conditions. In this paper, we propose a new biclustering algorithm based on evolutionary learning. By converting the biclustering problem into a common clustering problem, the algorithm can be applied in a search space constructed by the conditions. To further reduce the size of the search space, we randomly separate the full conditions into a number of condition subsets (subspaces), each of which has a smaller number of conditions. The algorithm is applied to each subspace and is able to discover bicluster seeds within a limited computing time. Finally, an expanding and merging procedure is employed to combine the bicluster seeds into larger biclusters according to a homogeneity criterion. We test the performance of the proposed algorithm using synthetic and real microarray data sets. Compared with several previously developed biclustering algorithms, our algorithm demonstrates a significant improvement in discovering additive biclusters."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4740","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4740","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4740","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4741","fieldValue":" Bacteria evolved cell to cell communication processes to gain information about their environment and regulate gene expression. Quorum sensing is such a process in which signaling molecules, called autoinducers, are produced, secreted and detected. In several cases bacteria use more than one autoinducers and integrate the information conveyed by them. It has not yet been explained adequately why bacteria evolved such signal integration circuits and what can learn about their environments using more than one autoinducers since all signaling pathways merge in one. Here quantum information theory, which includes classical information theory as a special case, is used to construct a quantum gate circuit that reproduces recent experimental results. Although the conditions in which biosystems exist do not allow for the appearance of quantum mechanical phenomena, the powerful computation tools of quantum information processing can be carefully used to cope with signal and information processing by these complex systems. A simulation algorithm based on this model has been developed and numerical experiments that analyze the dynamical operation of the quorum sensing circuit were performed for various cases of autoinducer variations, which revealed that these variations contain significant information about the environment in which bacteria exist."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4741","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4741","fieldValue":"Quorum sensing, systems biology, quantum information processing, quantum gates, modeling, simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4742","fieldValue":"Wang, Shu-Lin"}
