In this paper, we study the fundamental scaling law of the minimum total power (termed as critical total power) required to ensure k-connectivity in wireless networks. Contrary to several previous results that assume all nodes use a (minimum) common power, we allow nodes to choose different levels of transmission power. We show that under the assumption that wireless nodes form a homogeneous Poisson point process with density 位 in a unit square region [0, $1]^2, the critical total power required to maintain k-connectivity is  ((\u201C(c\/2+k)\/(k-1)!)位1-c\/2) with probability approaching one as 位 goes to infinity, where c is the path loss exponent. If k also goes to infinity, the expected critical total power is of the order of kc\/2位1-c\/2. Compared with the results that all nodes use a common critical transmission power for maintaining k-connectivity, we show that the critical total power can be reduced by an order of (log 位)c\/2$ by allowing nodes to optimally choose different levels of transmission power. This result is not subject to any specific power\/topology control algorithm, but rather a fundamental property of wireless networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9724","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9724","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9724","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9725","fieldValue":"Akan, zgr B."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9725","fieldValue":" Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSANs) are characterized by the collective effort of heterogenous nodes called sensors and actors. Sensor nodes collect information about the physical world, while actor nodes take action decisions and perform appropriate actions upon the environment. The collaborative operation of sensors and actors brings significant advantages over traditional sensing, including improved accuracy, larger coverage area and timely actions upon the sensed phenomena. However, to realize these potential gains, there is a need for an efficient transport layer protocol that can address the unique communication challenges introduced by the coexistence of sensors and actors. In this paper, a Real-Time and Reliable Transport $(RT)^2 protocol is presented for WSANs. The objective of the (RT)2 protocol is to reliably and collaboratively transport event features from the sensor field to the actor nodes with minimum energy dissipation and to timely react to sensor information with a right action. In this respect, the (RT)2 protocol simultaneously addresses congestion control and timely event transport reliability objectives in WSANs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort focusing on real-time and reliable transport protocol for WSANs. Performance evaluations via simulation experiments show that the (RT)2$ protocol achieves high performance in terms of reliable event detection, communication latency and energy consumption in WSANs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9725","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9725","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9725","fieldValue":"ACM"}
