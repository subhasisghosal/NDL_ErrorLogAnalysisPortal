Specifically, we start with the multiplicative fragment of linear logic and extend, on the one hand, to linear logic with its additives and, on the other, to the additives of the logic of bunched implications (BI). We give an algebraic method for calculating the distribution of the side-formul√¶ in multiplicative rules which allows the occurrence or non-occurrence of a formula on a branch of a proof to be determined once sufficient information is available. Each formula in the conclusion of such a rule is assigned a Boolean expression. As a search proceeds, a set of Boolean constraint equations is generated. We show that a solution to such a set of equations determines a proof corresponding to the given search. We explain a range of strategies, from the lazy to the eager, for solving sets of constraint equations. We indicate how to apply our methods systematically to large family of relevant systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11387","fieldValue":"ACM"}
