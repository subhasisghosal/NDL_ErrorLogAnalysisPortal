Services such as audio-on-demand drastically increase the loads on networks; therefore, new, robust, and highly efficient coding algorithms are necessary. One method overlooked to date, which can work alongside existing audio compression schemes, is that which takes into account the semantics and natural repetition of music. Similarity detection within polyphonic audio has presented problematic challenges within the field of music information retrieval. One approach to deal with bursty errors is to use self-similarity to replace missing segments. Many existing systems exist based on packet loss and replacement on a network level, but none attempt repairs of large dropouts of 5 seconds or more. Music exhibits standard structures that can be used as a forward error correction (FEC) mechanism. FEC is an area that addresses the issue of packet loss with the onus of repair placed as much as possible on the listener's device. We have developed a server--client-based framework (SoFI) for automatic detection and replacement of large packet losses on wireless networks when receiving time-dependent streamed audio. Whenever dropouts occur, SoFI swaps audio presented to the listener between a live stream and previous sections of the audio stored locally. Objective and subjective evaluations of SoFI where subjects were presented with other simulated approaches to audio repair together with simulations of replacements including varying lengths of time in the repair give positive results."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7623","fieldValue":"Pattern Matching Techniques for Replacing Missing Sections of Audio Streamed across Wireless Networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7623","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7623","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7624","fieldValue":"Yang, Christopher C"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7624","fieldValue":" Mining features and opinion words is essential for fine-grained opinion analysis of customer reviews. It is observed that semantic dependencies naturally exist between features and opinion words, even among features or opinion words themselves. In this article, we employ a corpus statistics association measure to quantify the pairwise word dependencies and propose a generalized association-based unified framework to identify features, including explicit and implicit features, and opinion words from reviews. We first extract explicit features and opinion words via an association-based bootstrapping method (ABOOT). ABOOT starts with a small list of annotated feature seeds and then iteratively recognizes a large number of domain-specific features and opinion words by discovering the corpus statistics association between each pair of words on a given review domain. Two instances of this ABOOT method are evaluated based on two particular association models, likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) and latent semantic analysis (LSA). Next, we introduce a natural extension to identify implicit features by employing the recognized known semantic correlations between features and opinion words. Experimental results illustrate the benefits of the proposed association-based methods for identifying features and opinion words versus benchmark methods."}
