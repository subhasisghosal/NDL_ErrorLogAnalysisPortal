Since GPUs operate many processing units and manage multiple levels of memory hierarchy, they consume a significant amount of power. Although several power models for CPUs are available, the power consumption of GPUs has not been studied much yet. In this article we develop a new power model for GPUs by utilizing McPAT, a CPU power tool. We generate initial power model data from McPAT with a detailed GPU configuration, and then adjust the models by comparing them with empirical data. We use the NVIDIA's Fermi architecture for building the power model, and our model estimates the GPU power consumption with an average error of 7.7&percnt; and 12.8&percnt; for the microbenchmarks and Merge benchmarks, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13382","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13382","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13383","fieldValue":"Lee, Chia-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13383","fieldValue":"Hsieh, Sun-Yuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13383","fieldValue":" Diagnosability is an important metric for measuring the reliability of multiprocessor systems. This article adopts the MM&ast; model and outlines the common properties of a wide class of interconnection networks, called component-composition graphs (CCGs), to determine their diagnosability by using their obtained properties. By applying the results to multiprocessor systems, the diagnosability of hypercube-like networks (including hypercubes, crossed cubes, MÃ¶bius cubes, twisted cubes, locally twisted cubes, generalized twisted cubes, and recursive circulants), star graphs, pancake graphs, bubble-sort graphs, and burnt pancake graphs, all of which belong to the class of CCGs, can also be computed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13383","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13383","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13384","fieldValue":"Kochte, Michael A"}
