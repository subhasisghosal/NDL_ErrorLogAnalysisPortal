The computational problem is to build a consensus map, which is a directed graph that includes and is consistent with all (or, the vast majority of) the markers in the input maps. However, when markers in the individual maps have ordering conflicts, the resulting consensus map will contain cycles. Here, we formulate the problem of resolving cycles in the context of a parsimonious paradigm that takes into account two types of errors that may be present in the input maps, namely, local reshuffles and global displacements. The resulting combinatorial optimization problem is, in turn, expressed as an integer linear program. A fast approximation algorithm is proposed, and an additional speedup heuristic is developed. Our algorithms were implemented in a software tool named MergeMap which is freely available for academic use. An extensive set of experiments shows that MergeMap consistently outperforms JoinMap, which is the most popular tool currently available for this task, both in terms of accuracy and running time.

We address the problem of \\beta-sheet prediction defined as the prediction of \\beta--strand pairings, interaction types (parallel or antiparallel), and \\beta-residue interactions (or contact maps). We introduce a Bayesian approach for proteins with six or less \\beta-strands in which we model the conformational features in a probabilistic framework by combining the amino acid pairing potentials with a priori knowledge of \\beta-strand organizations. To select the optimum \\beta-sheet architecture, we significantly reduce the search space by heuristics that enforce the amino acid pairs with strong interaction potentials. In addition, we find the optimum pairwise alignment between \\beta-strands using dynamic programming in which we allow any number of gaps in an alignment to model \\beta-bulges more effectively. For proteins with more than six \\beta-strands, we first compute \\beta-strand pairings using the BetaPro method. Then, we compute gapped alignments of the paired \\beta-strands and choose the interaction types and \\beta--residue pairings with maximum alignment scores. We performed a 10-fold cross-validation experiment on the BetaSheet916 set and obtained significant improvements in the prediction accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4575","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4575","fieldValue":"Protein \\beta-sheets, open \\beta-sheets, \\beta-sheet prediction, contact map prediction, Bayesian modeling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4575","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4575","fieldValue":"ACM"}
