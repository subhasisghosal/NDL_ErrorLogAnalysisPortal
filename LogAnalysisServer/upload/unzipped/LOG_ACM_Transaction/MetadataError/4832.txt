Until very recently, video streaming experiences left much to be desired. Over the last few years, this has significantly improved making monetization of streaming, possible. Recently, there has been an explosion of commercial video delivery services over the Internet, sometimes referred to as over-the-top (OTT) delivery. All these services invariably use streaming technologies. Initially, streaming had all the promise, then for a long time, it was download and play, later progressive download for short content, and now it is streaming again. Did streaming win the download versus streaming contest&quest; Did the best technology win&quest; The improvement in streaming experience has been possible through a variety of new streaming technologies, some proprietary and others extensions to standard protocols. The primary delivery mechanism for entertainment video, both premium content like movies and user generated content (UGC), tends to be HTTP streaming. Is HTTP streaming the panacea for all problems&quest; The goal of this article is to give an industry perspective of what fundamentally changed in video streaming that makes it commercially viable now. This article outlines how a blend of technology choices between download and streaming makes the current wave of ubiquitous streaming possible for entertainment video delivery. After identifying problems that still need to be solved, the article concludes with the lessons learnt from the video streaming evolution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25522","fieldValue":"ACM"}
