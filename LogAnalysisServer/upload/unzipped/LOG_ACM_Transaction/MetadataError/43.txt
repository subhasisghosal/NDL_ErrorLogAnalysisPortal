It can provide a better understanding of the human aspects in computer programming process and can also contribute to the computer programming education in general. The study identified the presence of a set of 42 CPs in computer programming (C language). The study used Verbal Protocol Analysis (VPA) in identifying these CPs. It is a qualitative study on the Verbal Protocols (VPs) of 19 students. Some of the CPs have been inferred by referring to the literature and some have been additionally identified by this study. The additional CPs found are confusion, hypothesis, interrogation, iteration, monitoring, recollection, recurrence, and translation. It is observed that programming involves the interplay of lower and higher CPs and needs various cognitive skills, which increase the processing load on the brain and make the programming process difficult and complex to learn and practice. The same set of CPs was found in both the effective and ineffective subjects. The research results can provide deeper knowledge to teachers on cognitive aspects of programming and the cognitive behavior of students during the programming process."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11107","fieldValue":"Identification of Cognitive Processes of Effective and Ineffective Students During Computer Programming"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11107","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11107","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11108","fieldValue":" Our approach to teaching introductory artificial intelligence (AI) unifies its diverse core topics through a theme of machine learning, and emphasizes how AI relates more broadly with computer science. Our work, funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, involves the development, implementation, and testing of a suite of projects that can be closely integrated into a one-term AI course. Each project involves the development of a machine learning system in a specific application. These projects have been used in six different offerings over a three-year period at three different types of institutions. While we have presented a sample of the projects as well as limited preliminary experiences in other venues, this article presents the first assessment of our work over an extended period of three years. Results of assessment show that the projects were well received by the students. By using projects involving real-world applications we provided additional motivation for students. While illustrating core concepts, the projects introduced students to an important area in computer science, machine learning, thus motivating further study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11109","fieldValue":"ACM"}
