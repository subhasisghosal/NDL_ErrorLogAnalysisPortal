We characterize this refinement with a kind of failure semantics and show that it â\u20ACœsupports itself,â\u20AC? for example, in the sense of thoroughnessâ\u20AC\u201Din contrast to standard modal refinements. We present a conjunction operator with respect to our new refinement, which is quite different from existing ones. It always returns an MTSâ\u20AC\u201Dagain in contrast to the case of modal refinement. Finally, we also consider De Nicolaâ\u20AC™s and Hennessyâ\u20AC™s may- and must-testing, where the latter leads to a semantics that is also compositional for hiding."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6947","fieldValue":"Hlzenspies, Philip K F"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6947","fieldValue":"Smit, Gerard J M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6947","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a mathematical characterisation of admissible schedules of cyclo-static dataflow (csdf) graphs. We demonstrate how algebra ic manipulation of this characterization is related to unfolding csdf actors and how this manipulation allows csdf graphs to be transformed into mrsdf graphs that are equivalent, in the sense that they admit the same set of schedules. The presented transformation allows the rich set of existing analysis techniques for mrsdf graphs to be applied to csdf graphs and generalizes the well-known transformations from csdf and mrsdf into hsdf. Moreover, it gives rise to an incremental approach to the analysis of csdf graphs, where approximate analyses are combined with exact transformations. We show the applicability of this incremental approach by demonstrating its effectiveness on the problem of optimizing buffer sizes under a throughput constraint."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6947","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6947","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6948","fieldValue":" In partially observed Petri nets, diagnosis is the task of detecting whether the given sequence of observed labels indicates that some unobservable fault has occurred. Diagnosability is an associated property of the Petri net, stating that in any possible execution, an occurrence of a fault can eventually be diagnosed. In this article, we consider diagnosability under the weak fairness (WF) assumption, which intuitively states that no transition from a given set can stay enabled foreverâ\u20AC\u201Dit must eventually either fire or be disabled. We show that a previous approach to WF-diagnosability in the literature has a major flaw and present a corrected notion. Moreover, we present an efficient method for verifying WF-diagnosability based on a reduction to LTL-X model checking. An important advantage of this method is that the LTL-X formula is fixedâ\u20AC\u201Din particular, the WF assumption does not have to be expressed as a part of it (which would make the formula length proportional to the size of the specification), but rather the ability of existing model checkers to handle weak fairness directly is exploited."}
