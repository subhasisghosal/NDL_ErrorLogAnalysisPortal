It can avoid the problems in automatic tagging and pure manual tagging by achieving a compromise between tagging performance and manual cost. However, conventional research efforts on interactive tagging mainly focus on sample selection and models for tag prediction. In this work, we investigate interactive tagging from a different aspect. We introduce an interactive image tagging framework that can more fully make use of human's labeling efforts. That means, it can achieve a specified tagging performance by taking less manual labeling effort or achieve better tagging performance with a specified labeling cost. In the framework, hashing is used to enable a quick clustering of image regions and a dynamic multiscale clustering labeling strategy is proposed such that users can label a large group of similar regions each time. We also employ a tag refinement method such that several inappropriate tags can be automatically corrected. Experiments on a large dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25610","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25610","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25611","fieldValue":" Video on Demand (VoD) services allow users to select and locally consume remotely stored content. We investigate the use of caching to solve the scalability issues of several existing VoD providers. We propose metrics and goals that define the requirements of a caching framework for CDNs of VoD systems. Using data logs collected from Motorola equipment from Comcast VoD deployments we show that several classic caching solutions do not satisfy the proposed goals. We address this issue by developing novel techniques for predicting future values of several metrics of interest. We rely on computed predictions to define the penalty imposed on the system, both network and caching sites, when not storing individual items. We use item penalties to devise novel caching and static content placement strategies. We use the previously mentioned data logs to validate our solutions and show that they satisfy all the defined goals."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25611","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25611","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25612","fieldValue":"ACM"}
