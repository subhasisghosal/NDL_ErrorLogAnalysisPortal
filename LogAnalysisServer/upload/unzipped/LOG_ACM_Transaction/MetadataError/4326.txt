It applies decision theory to model relevance decision preferences and shows that the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) specifies optimal ranking. It has two new components, namely a probabilistic evaluation model and a general measure of retrieval effectiveness. Its probabilities may be interpreted as subjective or objective ones. Its performance measure is the expected weighted rank which is the weighted average rank of a retrieval list. Starting from this measure, the expected forward rank and some existing retrieval effectiveness measures (e.g., top n precision and discounted cumulative gain) are instantiated using suitable weighting schemes after making certain assumptions. The significance of these instantiations is that the ranking prescribed by PRP is shown to be optimal simultaneously for all these existing performance measures. In addition, the optimal expected weighted rank may be used to normalize the expected weighted rank of retrieval systems for (summary) performance comparison (across different topics) between systems. The framework also extends PRP and our evaluation model to handle graded relevance, thereby generalizing the discussed, existing measures (e.g., top n precision) and probabilistic retrieval models for graded relevance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23993","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23993","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23994","fieldValue":" We consider the issue of evaluating information retrieval systems on the basis of a limited number of topics. In contrast to statistically-based work on sample sizes, we hypothesize that some topics or topic sets are better than others at predicting true system effectiveness, and that with the right choice of topics, accurate predictions can be obtained from small topics sets. Using a variety of effectiveness metrics and measures of goodness of prediction, a study of a set of TREC and NTCIR results confirms this hypothesis, and provides evidence that the value of a topic set for this purpose does generalize."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23995","fieldValue":" The current trend in distributed systems is towards service-based integration. This article describes an ontology-driven framework implemented to provide knowledge management for data of different modalities, with multimedia processing, annotation, and reasoning provided by remote services. The framework was developed in, and is presented in the context of, the Medical Imaging and Advanced Knowledge Technologies (MIAKT) project that sought to support the Multidisciplinary Meetings (MDMs) that take place during breast cancer screening for diagnosing the patient. However, the architecture is entirely independent of the specific application domain and can be quickly prototyped into new domains. An Enterprise server provides resource access to a client-side presentation application which, in turn, provides knowledge visualization and markup of any supported media, as defined by a domain-dependent ontology-supported language."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23995","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23995","fieldValue":"ACM"}
