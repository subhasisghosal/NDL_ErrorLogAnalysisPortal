Recent research into efficiently compressing sequence data has focused largely on improving compression ratios. Yet, the throughputs of current methods now lag far behind the I\/O bandwidths of modern storage systems. As biologists move their analyses to high-performance systems with greater I\/O bandwidth, low-throughput compression becomes a limiting factor. To address this gap, we present a new storage model called SeqDB, which offers high-throughput compression of sequence data with minimal sacrifice in compression ratio. It achieves this by combining the existing multithreaded Blosc compressor with a new data-parallel byte-packing scheme, called SeqPack, which interleaves sequence data and quality scores."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4890","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4890","fieldValue":"Throughput,Arrays,Bandwidth,Libraries,Bioinformatics,Instruction sets,Genomics,FASTQ,Compression,data storage,next-generation sequencing"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4890","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4890","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4891","fieldValue":"Zhang, Xiao-Fei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4891","fieldValue":"Dai, Dao-Qing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4891","fieldValue":"Wu, Meng-Yun"}
