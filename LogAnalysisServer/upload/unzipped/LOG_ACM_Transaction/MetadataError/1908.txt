{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16610","fieldValue":" This article presents a framework for symmetry-guided texture synthesis and processing. It is motivated by the long-standing problem of how to optimize, transfer, and control the spatial patterns in textures. The key idea is that symmetry representations that measure autocorrelations with respect to all transformations of a group are a natural way to describe spatial patterns in many real-world textures. To leverage this idea, we provide methods to transfer symmetry representations from one texture to another, process the symmetries of a texture, and optimize textures with respect to properties of their symmetry representations. These methods are automatic and robust, as they don't require explicit detection of discrete symmetries. Applications are investigated for optimizing, processing, and transferring symmetries and textures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16610","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16610","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16611","fieldValue":" We present a sparse analytic representation for spherical functions, including those expressed in a Spherical Harmonic (SH) expansion, that is amenable to fast and accurate rotation on the GPU. Exploiting the fact that each band-l SH basis function can be expressed as a weighted sum of 2l + 1 rotated band-l Zonal Harmonic (ZH) lobes, we develop a factorization that significantly reduces this number. We investigate approaches for promoting sparsity in the change-of-basis matrix, and also introduce lobe sharing to reduce the total number of unique lobe directions used for an order-N expansion from $N^2$ to 2N-1. Our representation does not introduce approximation error, is suitable for any type of spherical function (e.g., lighting or transfer), and requires no offline fitting procedure; only a (sparse) matrix multiplication is required to map to\/from SH. We provide code for our rotation algorithms, and apply them to several real-time rendering applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16611","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16611","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16612","fieldValue":" We present a novel, topology-adaptive method for deformable interface tracking, called the Deformable Simplicial Complex (DSC). In the DSC method, the interface is represented explicitly as a piecewise linear curve (in 2D) or surface (in 3D) which is a part of a discretization (triangulation\/tetrahedralization) of the space, such that the interface can be retrieved as a set of faces separating triangles\/tetrahedra marked as inside from the ones marked as outside (so it is also given implicitly). This representation allows robust topological adaptivity and, thanks to the explicit representation of the interface, it suffers only slightly from numerical diffusion. Furthermore, the use of an unstructured grid yields robust adaptive resolution. Also, topology control is simple in this setting. We present the strengths of the method in several examples: simple geometric flows, fluid simulation, point cloud reconstruction, and cut locus construction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16612","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16612","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16613","fieldValue":"McGonigal, Jane"}
