This improvement is demonstrated here when translating from English to four target languages-French, German, Italian and Arabic-using several test sets from recent MT evaluation campaigns. Using automatically labeled data for training, tuning and testing MT systems is beneficial on condition that labels are sufficiently accurate, typically above 70%. To reach such an accuracy, a large array of features for discourse connective labeling (morpho-syntactic, semantic and discursive) are extracted using state-of-the-art tools and exploited in factored MT models. The translation of connectives is improved significantly, between 0.7% and 10% as measured with the dedicated ACT metric. The improvements depend mainly on the level of ambiguity of the connectives in the test sets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3944","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3944","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3945","fieldValue":" Automatic speech recognition systems use noise compensation and acoustic model adaptation to increase robustness towards speaker and environmental variation. The current work focuses on noise compensation with bounded conditional mean imputation (BCMI). BCMI approaches are missing-data methods which operate on the assumption that noise-corrupted observations can be divided into reliable and unreliable components. BCMI methods substitute the unreliable components with a clean speech posterior distribution. The posterior means can be used as clean speech estimates and the posterior variances can be introduced in acoustic model likelihood calculation as observation uncertainties. In addition, we propose in the current work that similar uncertainties are introduced in acoustic model adaptation. Evaluation with speech data recorded in diverse public and car environments indicates that the proposed uncertainties improve adaptation performance. When uncertainties were used in acoustic model likelihood calculation and adaptation, the proposed imputation and adaptation system introduced 15%-84% relative error reductions to an uncompensated baseline system performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3946","fieldValue":"Lu, Bao-Liang"}
