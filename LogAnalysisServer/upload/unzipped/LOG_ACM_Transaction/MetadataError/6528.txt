While DVS is suitable for addressing workloads with uniformly high temperatures, for nonuniform workloads, performance loss occurs because of the slowdown of the cooler thread. To address this, we propose and evaluate DTM mechanisms that exploit the steering-based thread management mechanisms inherent in a clustered SMT architecture. We show that in contrast to DVS, which operates globally, our techniques are more effective at controlling temperature for nonuniform workloads. Furthermore, we devise a DTM technique that combines steering and DVS to achieve consistently good performance across all workloads."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1673","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1673","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7401","fieldValue":"Xue, Gui-Rong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7401","fieldValue":" Advertising keywords recommendation is an indispensable component for online advertising with the keywords selected from the target Web pages used for contextual advertising or sponsored search. Several ranking-based algorithms have been proposed for recommending advertising keywords. However, for most of them performance is still lacking, especially when dealing with short-text target Web pages, that is, those containing insufficient textual information for ranking. In some cases, short-text Web pages may not even contain enough keywords for selection. A natural alternative is then to recommend relevant keywords not present in the target Web pages. In this article, we propose a novel algorithm for advertising keywords recommendation for short-text Web pages by leveraging the contents of Wikipedia, a user-contributed online encyclopedia. Wikipedia contains numerous entities with related entities on a topic linked to each other. Given a target Web page, we propose to use a content-biased PageRank on the Wikipedia graph to rank the related entities. Furthermore, in order to recommend high-quality advertising keywords, we also add an advertisement-biased factor into our model. With these two biases, advertising keywords that are both relevant to a target Web page and valuable for advertising are recommended. In our experiments, several state-of-the-art approaches for keyword recommendation are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach produces substantial improvement in the precision of the top 20 recommended keywords on short-text Web pages over existing approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7401","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7401","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7402","fieldValue":"Xue, Gui-Rong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7402","fieldValue":" In learning to rank, both the quality and quantity of the training data have significant impacts on the performance of the learned ranking functions. However, in many applications, there are usually not sufficient labeled training data for the construction of an accurate ranking model. It is therefore desirable to leverage existing training data from other tasks when learning the ranking function for a particular task, an important problem which we tackle in this article utilizing a boosting framework with transfer learning. In particular, we propose to adaptively learn transferable representations called super-features from the training data of both the target task and the auxiliary task. Those super-features and the coefficients for combining them are learned in an iterative stage-wise fashion. Unlike previous transfer learning methods, the super-features can be adaptively learned by weak learners from the data. Therefore, the proposed framework is sufficiently flexible to deal with complicated common structures among different learning tasks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed transfer learning method for two datasets from the Letor collection and one dataset collected from a commercial search engine, and we also compare our methods with several existing transfer learning methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can enhance the ranking functions of the target tasks utilizing the training data from the auxiliary tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7402","fieldValue":"ACM"}
