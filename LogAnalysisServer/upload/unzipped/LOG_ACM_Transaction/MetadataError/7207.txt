These are mostly short-lived TCP connections that are delay-sensitive and have transfer times dominated by TCP backoffs, if any, during connection establishment. Unfortunately, arrivals of such connections at a server tend to be bursty, and can trigger multiple retransmissions, resulting in long average client-perceived delays. Traditional traffic control mechanisms, such as token bucket filters, are designed to complement admission control mechanisms, by regulating throughput, bounding service times, and protecting systems from overload. However, they cannot control connection-establishment delays, and thus, do not provide effective control of client-perceived delays. We first present the surprising discovery of a resynchronization property of retransmitted requests that exacerbates client-perceived delays when traditional control mechanisms are used. Then, we introduce a novel, multistage filtering scheme called Abacus Filters (AFs) that limits the client-perceived delay while maximizing server throughput even in the case of bursty connection arrivals. Analysis of delay-control properties of various filtering mechanisms is presented, along with a detailed performance evaluation. AFs are shown to provide tight delay control and better complement traditional admission control policies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9233","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1832","fieldValue":" To preserve the validity of loop nest transformations and parallelization, data dependences need to be analyzed. Memory dependences come in two varieties: true dependences or false dependences. While true dependences must be satisfied in order to preserve the correct order of computations, false dependences are induced by the reuse of a single memory location to store multiple values. False dependences reduce the degrees of freedom for loop transformations. In particular, loop tiling is severely limited in the presence of these dependences. While array expansion removes all false dependences, the overhead on memory and the detrimental impact on register-level reuse can be catastrophic. We propose and evaluate a compilation technique to safely ignore a large number of false dependences in order to enable loop nest tiling in the polyhedral model. It is based on the precise characterization of interferences between live range intervals, and it does not incur any scalar or array expansion. Our algorithms have been implemented in the Pluto polyhedral compiler, and evaluated on the PolyBench suite."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9234","fieldValue":" To effectively support communication in such a dynamic networking environment as the ad hoc networks, the routing framework has to be adaptable to the spatial and temporal changes in the characteristics of the network, such as traffic and mobility patterns. Multiscoping, as is provided through the concept of the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) for example, can serve as a basis for such an adaptive behavior. The Zone Routing framework implements hybrid routing by every network node proactively maintaining routing information about its local neighborhood called the routing zone, while reactively acquiring routes to destinations beyond the routing zone. In this paper, we propose the Independent Zone Routing (IZR) framework, an enhancement of the Zone Routing framework, which allows adaptive and distributed configuration for the optimal size of each node's routing zone, on the per-node basis. We demonstrate that the performance of IZR is significantly improved by its ability to automatically and dynamically tune the network routing operation, so as to flexibly and robustly support changes in the network characteristics and operational conditions. As a point of reference, through this form of adaptation, we show that the volume of routing control traffic overhead in the network can be reduced by an order of magnitude, under some set of parameter values. Furthermore, the adaptive nature of IZR enhances the scalability of these networks as well."}
