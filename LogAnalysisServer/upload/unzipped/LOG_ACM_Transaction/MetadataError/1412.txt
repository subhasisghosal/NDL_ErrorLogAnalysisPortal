Our method handles occlusion, high-frequency lighting, and is significantly faster than alternative methods based on Monte Carlo sampling. We achieve this speedup as a result of several ideas. First, we present a new metric for stratifying and sampling an environment map taking into account both the illumination intensity as well as the expected variance due to occlusion within the scene. We then present a novel hierarchical stratification algorithm that uses our metric to automatically stratify the environment map into regular strata. This approach enables a number of rendering optimizations, such as pre-integrating the illumination within each stratum to eliminate noise at the cost of adding bias, and sorting the strata to reduce the number of sample rays. We have rendered several scenes illuminated by natural lighting, and our results indicate that structured importance sampling is better than the best previous Monte Carlo techniques, requiring one to two orders of magnitude fewer samples for the same image quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15340","fieldValue":" We present an image-based technique to relight real objects illuminated by a 4D incident light field, representing the illumination of an environment. By exploiting the richness in angular and spatial variation of the light field, objects can be relit with a high degree of realism.We record photographs of an object, illuminated from various positions and directions, using a projector mounted on a gantry as a moving light source. The resulting basis images are used to create a subset of the full reflectance field of the object. Using this reflectance field, we can create an image of the object, relit with any incident light field and observed from a flxed camera position.To maintain acceptable recording times and reduce the amount of data, we propose an efficient data acquisition method.Since the object can be relit with a 4D incident light field, illumination effects encoded in the light field, such as shafts of shadow or spot light effects, can be realized."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15340","fieldValue":"ACM"}
