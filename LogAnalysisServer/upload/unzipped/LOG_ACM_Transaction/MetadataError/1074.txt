{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14259","fieldValue":" Temporal functional dependencies (TFD) are defined for temporal databases that include object identity. It is argued that object identity can overcome certain semantic diffuculties with existing temporal relational data models. Practical applications of TFDs in object bases are discussed. Reasoning about TFDs is at the center of this paper. It turns out that the distinction between acyclic and cyclic schemas is significant. For acyclic schemas, a complete axiomatization for finite implication is given and an algorithm for deciding finite implication provided. The same axiomatization is proven complete for unrestricted implication in unrestricted schemas, which can be cyclic. An interesting result is that there are cyclic schemas for which unrestricted and finite implication do not coincide. TFDs relate and extend some earlier work on dependency theory in temporal databases. Throughout this paper, the construct of TFD is compared with the notion of temporal FD introduced by Wang et al. (1997). A comparison with other related work is provided at the end of the article."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14260","fieldValue":" Relational databases provide the ability to store user-defined functions and predicates which can be invoked in SQL queries. When evaluation of a user-defined predicate is relatively expensive, the traditional method of evaluating predicates as early as possible is no longer a sound heuristic. There are two previous approaches for optimizing such queries. However, neither is able to guarantee the optimal plan over the desired execution space. We present efficient techniques that are able to guarantee the choice of an optimal plan over the desired execution space. The optimization algorithm with complete rank-ordering improves upon the naive optimization algorithm by exploiting the nature of the cost formulas for join methods and is polynomial in the number of user-defined predicates (for a given number of relations.) We also propose pruning rules that significantly reduce the cost of searching the execution space for both the naive algorithm as well as for the optimization algorithm with complete rank-ordering, without compromising optimality. We also propose a conservative local heuristic that is simpler and has low optimization overhead. Although it is not always guaranteed to find the optimal plans, it produces close to optimal plans in most cases. We discuss how, depending on application requirements, to determine the algorithm of choice. It should be emphasized that our optimization algorithms handle user-defined selections as well as user-defined join predicates uniformly. We present complexity analysis and experimental comparison of the algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14260","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14260","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2352","fieldValue":" We show that if there is a 2 âˆ\u2019 &epsis; approximation algorithm for vertex cover on graphs with vector chromatic number at most 2 + Î\u201D, then there is a 2 âˆ\u2019 f(&epsis;, Î\u201D) approximation algorithm for vertex cover for all graphs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2352","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2352","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14261","fieldValue":"Garca-Molina, Hctor"}
