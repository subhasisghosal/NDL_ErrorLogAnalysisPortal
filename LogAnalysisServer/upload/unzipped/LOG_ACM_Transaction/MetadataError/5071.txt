This system typically acquires the surrounding sound field by means of a microphone array. Signals acquired by the array are then processed using various methods. One of the widely applied methods is direction of arrival estimation. The conventional direction of arrival estimation methods assume that the array is fixed at a given position during the estimation. However, this is not necessarily true for an array installed on a moving humanoid robot. The array motion, if not accounted for appropriately, can introduce a significant error in the estimated direction of arrival. The current paper presents a signal model that takes the motion into account. Based on this model, two processing methods are proposed. The first one compensates for the motion of the robot. The second method is applicable to periodic signals and utilizes the motion in order to enhance the performance to a level beyond that of a stationary array. Numerical simulations and an experimental study are provided, demonstrating that the motion compensation method almost eliminates the motion-related error. It is also demonstrated that by using the motion-based enhancement method it is possible to improve the direction of arrival estimation performance, as compared to that obtained when using a stationary array."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3839","fieldValue":" This paper proposes a new class of local polynomial modeling (LPM)-based variable forgetting factor (VFF) recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms called the LPM-based VFF RLS (LVFF-RLS) algorithms. It models the time-varying channel coefficients as local polynomials so as to obtain the expressions of the bias and variance terms in the mean square error (MSE) of the RLS algorithm. A new locally optimal VFF (LOVFF) is then derived by minimizing the resulting MSE and the theoretical analysis is found to be in good agreement with experimental results. Methods for estimating the parameters involved in this LOVFF are also developed, resulting in an improved RLS algorithm with VFF. The algorithm is further extended to include variable regularization and a QR decomposition (QRD) version which is numerically more stable and amenable to multiplier-less implementation using coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm. Applications of these algorithms to frequency estimation and adaptive beamforming in time-varying speech and audio signals are also presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Simulations show that the convergence and tracking performance of the proposed algorithms compare favorably with conventional algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3839","fieldValue":"A new local polynomial modeling-based variable forgetting factor RLS algorithm and its acoustic applications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3839","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3839","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3840","fieldValue":"de-la-Calle-Silos, Fernando"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3840","fieldValue":"Valverde-Albacete, Francisco J."}
