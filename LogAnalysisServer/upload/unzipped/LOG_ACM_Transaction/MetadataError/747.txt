The new ratio is used to compare online algorithms directly by taking the ratio of their performances on their respective worst permutations of a worst-case sequence. Two variants of the bin packing problem are considered: the classical bin packing problem, where the goal is to fit all items in as few bins as possible, and the dual bin packing problem, which is the problem of maximizing the number of items packed in a fixed number of bins. Several known algorithms are compared using this new measure, and a new, simple variant of first-fit is proposed for dual bin packing. Many of our results are consistent with those previously obtained with the competitive ratio or the competitive ratio on accommodating sequences, but new separations and easier proofs are found."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2263","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2263","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13250","fieldValue":"Eder, Kerstin I"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13250","fieldValue":" The increasing complexity and size of digital designs, in conjunction with the lack of a potent verification methodology that can effectively cope with this trend, continue to inspire engineers and academics in seeking ways to further automate design verification. In an effort to increase performance and to decrease engineering effort, research has turned to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for effective solutions. The generation of tests for simulation-based verification can be guided by machine-learning techniques. In fact, recent advances demonstrate that embedding machine-learning (ML) techniques into a coverage-directed test generation (CDG) framework can effectively automate the test generation process, making it more effective and less error-prone. This article reviews some of the most promising approaches in this field, aiming to evaluate the approaches and to further stimulate more directed research in this area."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13250","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13250","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13251","fieldValue":"Breuer, Melvin A"}
