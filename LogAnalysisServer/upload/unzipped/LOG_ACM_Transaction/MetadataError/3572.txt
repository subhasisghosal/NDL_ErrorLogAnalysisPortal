This class of application will have a multilayer architecture, where each layer is likely to use languages and technologies appropriate to its own concerns. An example application is a geographically large-scale crisis management system. Typically, such applications are required to dynamically adapt their behavior based on current circumstances, with adaptations potentially affecting all layers of the application. The complexities involved in dynamically adapting multilayer applications will significantly benefit from formal approaches to its specification. This article presents a new methodology for flexible, multilayer application adaptation, with layer-specific adaptation solution templates bound to application mismatches that are organized into hierarchical taxonomies. Templates can be linked either through direct invocations or through adaptation events, supporting flexible cross-layer adaptation. The methodology illustrates the use of different formalisms for different elements of its specification. In particular, we combine semiformal metamodeling techniques for the system model specification with formal Petri nets, which are used to capture template matchmaking using reachability analysis. This work demonstrates how existing formalisms can be used for the specification of a generic adaptation model for pervasive applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1225","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1225","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3070","fieldValue":" Due to lack of a word\/phrase\/sentence boundary, summarization of Thai multiple documents has several challenges in unit segmentation, unit selection, duplication elimination, and evaluation dataset construction. In this article, we introduce Thai Elementary Discourse Units (TEDUs) and their derivatives, called Combined TEDUs (CTEDUs), and then present our three-stage method of Thai multi-document summarization, that is, unit segmentation, unit-graph formulation, and unit selection and summary generation. To examine performance of our proposed method, a number of experiments are conducted using 50 sets of Thai news articles with their manually constructed reference summaries. Based on measures of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-SU4, the experimental results show that: (1) the TEDU-based summarization outperforms paragraph-based summarization; (2) our proposed graph-based TEDU weighting with importance-based selection achieves the best performance; and (3) unit duplication consideration and weight recalculation help improve summary quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3070","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3070","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21603","fieldValue":"Schrder-Preikschat, Wolfgang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21603","fieldValue":" We explore the advantages of using Erasure Codes (ECs) in a very challenging sensor networking scenario, namely, monitoring and tracking bats in the wild. The mobile bat nodes collect contact information that needs to be transmitted to stationary base stations whenever they are in communication range. We are particularly interested in improving the overall communication reliability of the wireless communication. The mobile nodes are capable of storing a few 100kB of data and to exchange contact information in aggregated form. Due to the continuous flight of the bats and the forest environment, the wireless channel quality varies quickly and, thus, the communication is in general assumed to be highly unreliable. Given the very strict energy constraints of the mobile node and the inherently asymmetric channels, conventional techniques such as full data replication or Automatic Repeat Request to improve the communication reliability are prohibitive. In this work, we investigate the tradeoff between reliability achieved and the cost in form of additional transmissions, that is, the additional energy costs. Our energy measurements on a real platform combined with larger-scale simulation of the wireless communication clearly indicate the advantages of using ECs in our scenario. The results are also applicable in other configurations when unreliable communication channels meet tight energy budgets."}
