With no coordination amongst these personal sensor networks, the proposed game maximizes each networkâ\u20AC™s packet delivery ratio (PDR) at low transmit power. In this context, we provide a novel utility function, which gives reduced benefit to players with higher transmission power, and a subsequent reduction in radio interference to other coexisting BANs. Considering the purpose of inter-BAN interference mitigation, PDR is expressed as a compressed exponential function of inverse signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio, so it is essentially a function of transmit powers of all coexisting BANs. It is shown that a unique Nash Equilibrium (NE) exists, and hence there is a subgame-perfect equilibrium, considering best response at each stage independent of history. In addition, the NE is conjectured to be the socially optimal solution according to all possible action profiles. Realistic and extensive on- and inter-body channel models are employed. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in better interference management, greater reliability, and reduced transmit power when compared with other schemes that can be applied in BANs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21622","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21622","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21623","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks enable a wealth of new applications in areas such as military, medical, environmental, transportation, smart city, and so on. In many of these scenarios, we need to measure in a secure way the positions of the sensors. Existing range-based techniques for secure positioning require a burdensome infrastructure, with many fixed anchors. Reducing the infrastructure would reduce deployment cost and foster the adoption of secure positioning solutions in wireless sensor networks. In this article, we propose SPEM, a secure positioning system based on multilateration and ultra-wideband (UWB) distance bounding protocols. The key idea behind SPEM is to leverage the low probability that an adversary has of controlling enlargement attacks against UWB. We estimate such a probability by a thorough study and signal-level simulations of the UWB physical layer. We test SPEM both in a simulated environment and in a real indoor environment using real UWB transceivers. We show that SPEM needs far less infrastructure than state-of-the-art solutions ( âˆ\u2019 22&percnt; to âˆ\u2019 93&percnt;, depending on the anchor deployment method), while achieving high levels of security against smart and determined adversaries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21623","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21623","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21624","fieldValue":" This article presents a Light Intensity--based Positioning System (LIPS) for indoor environments. The system uses off-the-shelf light-emitting diode lamps as signal sources and light sensors as signal receivers. The design is inspired by the observation that a light sensor has deterministic sensitivity to both the distance and incident angle of a light signal, an under-utilized feature of photodiodes now widely found on mobile devices. We develop a stable and accurate light intensity model to capture the phenomenon, based on which a new positioning principle, Multi-Face Light Positioning, is established that uses three collocated sensors to uniquely determine the receiverâ\u20AC™s position, assuming merely a single source of light. We have implemented a prototype on both dedicated embedded systems and smartphones. Experimental results show average positioning accuracy within 0.4m across different environments, with high stability against interferences from obstacles, ambient lights, temperature variation, and so on."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21624","fieldValue":"ACM"}
