{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9860","fieldValue":" For all-optical WDM networks that provide multiple classes of service, we present a methodology for computing approximate blocking probabilities of dynamic routing and wavelength assignment policies. Each service class is characterized by its resource requirements (number of wavelengths needed for a call) and expected call holding time (or subscription period). Under the wavelength continuity constraint on lightpaths and loss network formulation, we develop fixed-point approximation algorithms that compute approximate blocking probabilities of all classes. We then apply them to the random wavelength assignment policy for the following wavelength routing policies: Fixed Routing (FR), Least Loaded Routing (LLR) and Fixed Alternate Routing (FAR). Simulation results on different network topologies and routing policies considered demonstrate that the simulation results match closely with the blocking probabilities computed by our methods for different multiclass call traffic loading scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9860","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9860","fieldValue":"An analytic approach to efficiently computing call blocking probabilities for multiclass WDM networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9861","fieldValue":" The major challenge in survivable mesh networks is the design of resource allocation algorithms that allocate network resources efficiently while at the same time are able to recover from a failure quickly. This issue is particularly more challenging in optical networks operating under wavelength continuity constraint, where the same wavelength must be assigned on all links in the selected path. This paper proposes two approaches to solve the survivable routing and wavelength assignment RWA problem under static traffic using p-cycles techniques. The first is a nonjointly approach, where the minimum backup capacity against any single span failure is set up first. Then the working lightpaths problem is solved by first generating the most likely candidate routes for each source and destination s-d pair. These candidate routes are then used to formulate the overall problem as an ILP problem. Alternatively, for a more optimum solution, the problem can be solved jointly, where the working routes and the backup p-cycles are jointly formulated as an ILP problem to minimize the total capacity required. Furthermore, only a subset of high merit cycles that are most likely able to protect the proposed working paths is used in the formulation. Reducing the number of candidate cycles in the final formulation plays a significant role in reducing the number of variables required to solve the problem. To reduce the number of candidate cycles in the formulation, a new metric called Route Sensitive Efficiency (RSE)--has been introduced to pre-select a reduced number of high merit cycle candidates. The RSE ranks each cycle based on the number of links of the primary candidate routes that it can protect. The two approaches were tested and their performances were compared."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9861","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8387","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
