Traditional requirements engineering (RE) techniques addressing stakeholdersâ\u20AC™ social interaction are mainly part of a centralized process intertwined with a specific phase of software development. However, in open-source software (OSS) development, stakeholdersâ\u20AC™ social interactions are often decentralized, iterative, and dynamic. Little is known about new requirements identification in OSS and the stakeholdersâ\u20AC™ organizational arrangements supporting such an activity. In this article, we investigate the theory of structural hole from the context of contributing new requirements in OSS projects. Structural hole theory suggests that stakeholders positioned in the structural holes in their social network are able to produce new ideas. In this study, we find that structural hole positions emerge in stakeholdersâ\u20AC™ social network and these positions are positively related to contributing a higher number of new requirements. We find that along with structural hole positions, stakeholdersâ\u20AC™ role is also an important part in identifying new requirements. We further observe that structural hole positions evolve over time, thereby identifying requirements to realize enriched features. Our work advances the fundamental understanding of the RE process in a decentralized environment and opens avenues for improved techniques supporting this process."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/8246","fieldValue":"Stakeholders&rsquo; social network"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8246","fieldValue":"On the Role of Structural Holes in Requirements Identification: An Exploratory Study on Open-Source Software Development"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8247","fieldValue":" News agencies regularly use Twitter to publicize and increase readership of their articles. Although substantial research on the spread of news on Twitter exists, there hasn't been much focus on the study of the spread of news articles. In this study, we present an innovative methodology involving weighted ego networks to understand how news agencies propagate news articles using their Twitter handle. We propose a set of measures to compare the propagation process of different news agencies by studying important aspects such as volume, extent of spread, conversion rate, multiplier effect, lifespan, hourly response, and audience participation. Using a dataset of tweets collected over a period of 6 months, we apply our methodology and suggest a framework to help news agencies gauge their performance on social media and also provide critical insights into the phenomenon of news article propagation on Twitter."}
