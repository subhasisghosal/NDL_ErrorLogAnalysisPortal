Two primary factors that affect the data collection rate (throughput) and timeliness (delay) are: 1) efficiency of the link scheduling protocol, and 2) structure of the routing tree in terms of its node degrees and radius. In this paper, we utilize multiple frequency channels and design an efficient link scheduling protocol that gives a constant factor approximation on the optimal throughput in delivering aggregated data from all the nodes to the sink. To minimize the maximum delay subject to a given throughput bound, we also design an (Î±, Î²)-bicriteria approximation algorithm to construct a Bounded-Degree Minimum-Radius Spanning Tree, with the radius of the tree at most Î² times the minimum possible radius for a given degree bound $Î\u201D^*, and the degree of any node at most Î\u201D*$ + Î±, where Î± and Î² are positive constants. Lastly, we evaluate the efficiency of our algorithms on different types of spanning trees and show that multichannel scheduling, combined with optimal routing topologies, can achieve the best of both worlds in terms of maximizing the aggregated data collection rate and minimizing the maximum packet delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10243","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10243","fieldValue":"Multichannel scheduling and spanning trees: throughput-delay tradeoff for fast data collection in sensor networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10244","fieldValue":" We extend the analysis of the scaling laws of wireless ad hoc networks to the case of correlated nodes movements, which are commonly found in real mobility processes. We consider a simple version of the Reference Point Group Mobility model, in which nodes belonging to the same group are constrained to lie in a disc area, whose center moves uniformly across the network according to the i.i.d. model. We assume fast mobility conditions and take as a primary goal the maximization of per-node throughput. We discover that correlated node movements have a huge impact on asymptotic throughput and delay and can sometimes lead to better performance than the one achievable under independent nodes movements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10244","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
