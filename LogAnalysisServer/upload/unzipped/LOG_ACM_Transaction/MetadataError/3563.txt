We consider mixed WSNs that consist of sparse static sensor deployments and mobile sensors that move continuously to monitor uncovered (vacant) areas in the sensor field. Mobile sensors move autonomously and cooperatively by executing a path planning algorithm. Using a simplified scenario, the article derives the optimal path strategy for a single mobile sensor to search two nonconnected uncovered regions with the minimum average detection delay or with the maximum dynamic coverage. The resulting optimal strategy confirms that it is better to search areas that are less likely to hide a target but are located closer to the mobile node, rather than heading toward the most likely area. Based on the insights gained from the simplified scenario and the theory of coverage processes, the article proposes a surrogate method to approximate the best searching neighborhood radius (a design parameter of the path planning algorithm) that optimizes the dynamic coverage and event detection time capabilities of mixed WSN deployments. Extensive simulation results indicate that this approach can achieve very good results, both for a single and for multiple collaborating mobile sensors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21578","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21578","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21579","fieldValue":"Al-Hamadi, Hamid"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21579","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose and analyze dynamic redundancy management of integrated intrusion detection and tolerance for lifetime maximization of homogeneous clustered wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We take a holistic approach of integrating multisource and multipath routing for intrusion tolerance with majority voting for intrusion detection in our redundancy management protocol design. By dynamically controlling the redundancy level for both multisource multipath routing and voting-based intrusion detection with energy consideration, we identify the optimal redundancy level to be applied to maximize the WSN lifetime in response to changing environment conditions including node density, radio range, and node capture rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated redundancy management protocol by a comparative analysis with a multisource multipath routing algorithm called AFTQC that considers only fault\/intrusion tolerance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21580","fieldValue":"Banks, M Katherine"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21580","fieldValue":" Monitoring flow-based systems (FBS) (e.g., water distribution systems, oil and gas pipelines, the human cardiovascular system) is of paramount importance considering their economic and health impacts. FBS monitoring typically has been achieved by costly, complex, static sensors that are strategically placed. To reduce the cost of monitoring, we propose a mobile wireless sensor network (WSN) system comprised of mobile sensors (their movement aided by the inherent flow in the FBS) and static beacons that aid in locating sensors. This article presents the first complete architectural design, algorithms, and protocols for optimal monitoring of FBS. Our proposed solution includes sensing and communication models, MAC and group management protocols for sensor and beacon communication, and algorithms for sensor and beacon placement. We compare our proposed solution with the state of the art through extensive simulations and a proof-of-concept system implementation. We demonstrate performance improvements, such as a dramatic reduction (a factor of 91) in the number of sensors when the sensing range is marginally (2.5 times) increased."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21580","fieldValue":"ACM"}
