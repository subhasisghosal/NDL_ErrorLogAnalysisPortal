{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3902","fieldValue":" In order to improve the performance of singer identification, we propose a system to separate singing voice from music accompaniment for monaural recordings. Our system consists of two key stages. The first stage exploits the nonnegative matrix partial co-factorization (NMPCF), which is a joint matrix decomposition integrating prior knowledge of singing voice and pure accompaniment to separate the mixture signal into singing voice portion and accompaniment portion. In the second stage, based on the separated singing voice obtained by the first stage, the pitches of singing voice are first estimated and then the harmonic components of singing voice can be distinguished. For a frame, the distinguished harmonic components are regarded as reliable while other frequency components unreliable, thus the spectrum is incomplete. With those harmonic components, the complete spectrums of singing voice can be reconstructed by a missing feature method, spectrum reconstruction, obtaining a refined signal with more clean singing voice. Experimental results demonstrate that, from the point view of source separation, the singing voice refinement can further improve Î\u201DSNR in contrast with the singing voice separation using NMPCF, while for the point view of singer identification, the singing voice separated by NMPCF is more appropriate than the refined singing voice."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3902","fieldValue":"Separation of singing voice using nonnegative matrix partial co-factorization for singer identification"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3902","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3902","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3903","fieldValue":" In this paper, to address problems in multichannel music signal separation, we propose a new hybrid method that combines directional clustering and advanced nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The aims of multichannel music signal separation technology is to extract a specific target signal from observed multichannel signals that contain multiple instrumental sounds. In previous studies, various methods using NMF have been proposed, but many problems remain including poor separation accuracy and lack of robustness. To solve these problems, we propose a new supervised NMF (SNMF) with spectrogram restoration and a hybrid method that concatenates the proposed SNMF after directional clustering. Via the extrapolation of supervised spectral bases, the proposed SNMF attempts both target signal separation and reconstruction of the lost target components, which are generated by preceding directional clustering. In addition, we experimentally reveal the trade-off between separation and extrapolation abilities and propose a new scheme for adaptive divergence, where the optimal divergence can be automatically changed in each time frame according to the local spatial conditions. The results of an evaluation experiment show that our proposed hybrid method outperforms the conventional music signal separation methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3903","fieldValue":"Multichannel signal separation combining directional clustering and nonnegative matrix factorization with spectrogram restoration"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3903","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3903","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3904","fieldValue":"Mai, Van-Khanh"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3904","fieldValue":"Assa-El-Bey, Abdeldjalil"}
