In this article, we design and conduct the first detailed measurement study on the performance of the state-of-the-art screencast technologies. Several commercial and one open-source screencast technologies are considered in our detailed analysis, which leads to several insights: (1) there is no single winning screencast technology, indicating room to further enhance the screencast technologies; (2) hardware video encoders significantly reduce the CPU usage at the expense of slightly higher GPU usage and end-to-end delay, and should be adopted in future screencast technologies; (3) comprehensive error resilience tools are needed as wireless communication is vulnerable to packet loss; (4) emerging video codecs designed for screen contents lead to a better Quality of Experience (QoE) of screencast; and (5) rate adaptation mechanisms are critical to avoiding degraded QoE due to network dynamics. As a case study, we propose a nonintrusive yet accurate available bandwidth estimation mechanism. Real experiments demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of our proposed solution. Our measurement methodology, open-source screencast platform, and case study allow researchers and developers to quantitatively evaluate other design considerations, which will lead to optimized screencast technologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25778","fieldValue":"ACM"}
