{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3074","fieldValue":" Measuring the quality of the translation rules and their composition is an essential issue in the conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) framework. To express the translation quality, the previous lexical and phrasal probabilities are calculated only according to the co-occurrence statistics in the bilingual corpus and may be not reliable due to the data sparseness problem. To address this issue, we propose measuring the quality of the translation rules and their composition in the semantic vector embedding space (VES). We present a recursive neural network (RNN)-based translation framework, which includes two submodels. One is the bilingually-constrained recursive auto-encoder, which is proposed to convert the lexical translation rules into compact real-valued vectors in the semantic VES. The other is a type-dependent recursive neural network, which is proposed to perform the decoding process by minimizing the semantic gap (meaning distance) between the source language string and its translation candidates at each state in a bottom-up structure. The RNN-based translation model is trained using a max-margin objective function that maximizes the margin between the reference translation and the n-best translations in forced decoding. In the experiments, we first show that the proposed vector representations for the translation rules are very reliable for application in translation modeling. We further show that the proposed type-dependent, RNN-based model can significantly improve the translation quality in the large-scale, end-to-end Chinese-to-English translation evaluation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3074","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3074","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21688","fieldValue":"DeHon, Andr"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21688","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21688","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21689","fieldValue":" A new method for improving the timing yield offield-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices affected by intrinsicwithin-die variation is proposed.

Anothersimulation result showed that the effectiveness of the proposedtechnique was saturated at the use of 10 or more configurationsbecause of the degradation of the quality of the configurations.Therefore, the use of 10 or fewer configurations is reasonable."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21689","fieldValue":"FPGA"}
