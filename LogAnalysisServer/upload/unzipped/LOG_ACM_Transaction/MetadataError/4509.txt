It is a creative linguistic phenomenon where affect-related aspects play a key role. In this work, we address the problem of detecting irony in tweets, casting it as a classification problem. We propose a novel model that explores the use of affective features based on a wide range of lexical resources available for English, reflecting different facets of affect. Classification experiments over different corpora show that affective information helps in distinguishing among ironic and nonironic tweets. Our model outperforms the state of the art in almost all cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3380","fieldValue":" Time-varying geospatial data presents some specific challenges for visualization. Here, we report the results of three experiments aiming at evaluating the relative efficiency of three existing visualization techniques for a class of such data. The class chosen was that of object movement, especially the movements of vehicles in a fictitious landscape. Two different tasks were also chosen. One was to predict where three vehicles will meet in the future given a visualization of their past movement history. The second task was to estimate the order in which four vehicles arrived at a specific place. Our results reveal that previous findings had generalized human perception in these situations and that large differences in user efficiency exist for a given task between different types of visualizations depicting the same data. Furthermore, our results are in line with earlier general findings on the nature of human perception of both object shape and scene changes. Finally, the need for new taxonomies of data and tasks based on results from perception research is discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3380","fieldValue":"2D"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3380","fieldValue":"3D"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3380","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3380","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24530","fieldValue":" Recommendation on signed social rating networks is studied through an innovative approach. Bayesian probabilistic modeling is used to postulate a realistic generative process, wherein user and item interactions are explained by latent factors, whose relevance varies within the underlying network organization into user communities and item groups. Approximate posterior inference captures distrust propagation and drives Gibbs sampling to allow rating and (dis)trust prediction for recommendation along with the unsupervised exploratory analysis of network organization. Comparative experiments reveal the superiority of our approach in rating and link prediction on Epinions and Ciao, besides community quality and recommendation sensitivity to network organization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24530","fieldValue":"ACM"}
