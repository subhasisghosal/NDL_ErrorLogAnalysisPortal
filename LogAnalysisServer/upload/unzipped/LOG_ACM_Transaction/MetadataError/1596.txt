Shapes -- triangular meshes or more generally straight line graphs in Euclidean space -- are treated as points in a shape space. We introduce useful Riemannian metrics in this space to aid the user in design and modeling tasks, especially to explore the space of (approximately) isometric deformations of a given shape. Much of the work relies on an efficient algorithm to compute geodesics in shape spaces; to this end, we present a multi-resolution framework to solve the interpolation problem -- which amounts to solving a boundary value problem -- as well as the extrapolation problem -- an initial value problem -- in shape space. Based on these two operations, several classical concepts like parallel transport and the exponential map can be used in shape space to solve various geometric modeling and geometry processing tasks. Applications include shape morphing, shape deformation, deformation transfer, and intuitive shape exploration."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15820","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15820","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15821","fieldValue":" The geometric challenges in the architectural design of freeform shapes come mainly from the physical realization of beams and nodes. We approach them via the concept of parallel meshes, and present methods of computation and optimization. We discuss planar faces, beams of controlled height, node geometry, and multilayer constructions. Beams of constant height are achieved with the new type of edge offset meshes. Mesh parallelism is also the main ingredient in a novel discrete theory of curvatures. These methods are applied to the construction of quadrilateral, pentagonal and hexagonal meshes, discrete minimal surfaces, discrete constant mean curvature surfaces, and their geometric transforms. We show how to design geometrically optimal shapes, and how to find a meaningful meshing and beam layout for existing shapes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15821","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15821","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15822","fieldValue":"McKenzie, Alexander"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15822","fieldValue":" We present a purely Eulerian framework for geometry processing of surfaces and foliations. Contrary to current Eulerian methods used in graphics, we use conservative methods and a variational interpretation, offering a unified framework for routine surface operations such as smoothing, offsetting, and animation. Computations are performed on a fixed volumetric grid without recourse to Lagrangian techniques such as triangle meshes, particles, or path tracing. At the core of our approach is the use of the Coarea Formula to express area integrals over isosurfaces as volume integrals. This enables the simultaneous processing of multiple isosurfaces, while a single interface can be treated as the special case of a dense foliation. We show that our method is a powerful alternative to conventional geometric representations in delicate cases such as the handling of high-genus surfaces, weighted offsetting, foliation smoothing of medical datasets, and incompressible fluid animation."}
