Duty cycling for wireless camera networks meant for tracking objects is made complex by the nodes having to anticipate the arrival of the objects in their field-of-view. The consequences of an object arriving in the view-region of a camera when it is sleeping need no elaboration. Our work presents a predictive framework to provide nodes with an ability to anticipate the arrival of objects in the field-of-view of their cameras. Our predictive framework differs from others in that the nodes whose duty cycles are increased are at least one step removed from the immediate neighborhood of the nodes where the objects are currently visible. By eliminating the need for the currently busiest nodes to also be in charge of informing their nonbusy immediate neighbors to get ready for object arrival, we end up with a more robust strategy for updating the duty cycle at the nodes where the objects are highly likely to appear soon. The proposed scheme works by using an existing MAC header bit that is already in the 802.15.4 protocol and, in that sense, our anticipatory approach for notifying the nodes about the current state of the object location entails no additional expenditure of energy. Our contribution includes evaluations based on large-scale simulations as well as real experiments with an Imote2-based wireless camera network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21472","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21472","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21473","fieldValue":" Tracking persons with multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view instead of with one camera leads to more robust decisions. However, operating multiple cameras instead of one requires more processing power and communication bandwidth, which are limited resources in practical networks. When the fields of view of different cameras overlap, not all cameras are equally needed for localizing a tracking target. When only a selected set of cameras do processing and transmit data to track the target, a substantial saving of resources is achieved. The recent introduction of smart cameras with on-board image processing and communication hardware makes such a distributed implementation of tracking feasible. We present a novel framework for selecting cameras to track people in a distributed smart camera network that is based on generalized information-theory. By quantifying the contribution of one or more cameras to the tracking task, the limited network resources can be allocated appropriately, such that the best possible tracking performance is achieved. With the proposed method, we dynamically assign a subset of all available cameras to each target and track it in difficult circumstances of occlusions and limited fields of view with the same accuracy as when using all cameras."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21473","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21473","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21474","fieldValue":"Nino-Castaneda, Jorge Oswaldo"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21474","fieldValue":"Hese, Peter van"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21474","fieldValue":"Cauwelaert, Dimitri van"}
