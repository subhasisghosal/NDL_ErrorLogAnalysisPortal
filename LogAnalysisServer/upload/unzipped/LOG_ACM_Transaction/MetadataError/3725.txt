Consider a scenario in which a group of users is trying to find a common meeting location, yet attempting to include all group members is introducing a significant traveling cost to most of them. In this article, we formulate a new query type called the consensus query, which can be used to help users explore these trade-off options to find a solution upon which everyone can agree. Specifically, we study the problem of evaluating consensus queries in the context of nearest neighbor queries, where the group is interested in finding a meeting place that minimizes the travel distance for at least a specified number of group members. To help the group in selecting a suitable solution, the major challenge is to find optimal subgroups of all allowable subgroup sizes, i.e., greater or equal to the minimum specified subgroup size, that minimize the travel distances. We develop incremental algorithms to evaluate in one pass the optimal query subgroups of different sizes along with their corresponding nearest data points. These subsets, which are evaluated by the location-based service provider, constitute the answer set that is returned to the group. The group then collaboratively selects the final answer from the candidate answer set. An extensive experimental study shows the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21981","fieldValue":" Dynamic ride sharing is a service that enables shared vehicle rides in real time and on short notice. It can be an effective solution to counter the problem of increasing traffic jams at peak hours in cities. The growing use and popularity of smart phones and GPS-enabled devices provides us with tools required to efficiently implement ride sharing and significantly enhance carpooling. However, privacy and safety concerns are the main obstacles faced when encouraging people to use such a service. In this work, we present â\u20ACœMatch Maker,â\u20AC? a negotiation-based model that hides exact location information data for system participants while implementing privacy preserving ride sharing. We use the concept of imprecision (not being precise about location of the user out of set of n locations) and follow the idea of obfuscation, which equates a higher degree of imprecision with a higher degree of privacy. We identify two attack types that could circumvent privacy preserving ride sharing. We compare the Match Maker model with the standard central trusted server model collecting precise location data, which we term eBay model. We provide the first comprehensive approach that integrates privacy, safety and trust in a single model. We present a recursive ellipse-based algorithm to compute an optimal driver path as well as three negotiation strategies for drivers and passengers. We conduct extensive experiments on real road networks and compare the strategies for privacy and effectiveness of ride sharing in terms of traffic load and vehicle km reduction. We show that ride sharing saves between 9&percnt; and 21&percnt; (on average 12&percnt;) of vehicle km if drivers are only prepared to accept slight detours of their usual trips. In the city of Melbourne, with 11.6 million trips a weekday and an average trip length of 10.2 km, this would save 14.2 million km per weekday."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3101","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose Fuzzy Hindi WordNet, which is an extended version of Hindi WordNet. The proposed idea of fuzzy relations and their role in modeling Fuzzy Hindi WordNet is explained. We mathematically define fuzzy relations and the composition of these fuzzy relations for this extended version. We show that the concept of composition of fuzzy relations can be used to infer a relation between two words that otherwise are not directly related in Hindi WordNet. Then we propose fuzzy graph connectivity measures that include both local and global measures. These measures are used in determining the significance of a concept (which is represented as a vertex in the fuzzy graph) in a specific context. Finally, we show how these extended measures solve the problem of word sense disambiguation (WSD) effectively, which is useful in many natural language processing applications to improve their performance. Experiments on standard sense tagged corpus for WSD show better results when Fuzzy Hindi WordNet is used in place of Hindi WordNet."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3101","fieldValue":"ACM"}
