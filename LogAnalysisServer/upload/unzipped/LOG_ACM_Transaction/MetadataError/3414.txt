The detection criterion is the degree of low-frequency periodicity in the acoustic signal, and the periodicity is computed from the â\u20ACœbumpinessâ\u20AC? of the autocorrelation of a one-bit version of the signal. We then describe a CMOS ASIC that implements the periodicity estimation algorithm. The ASIC is fully functional and its core consumes 835 nanowatts. It was integrated into an acoustic enclosure and deployed in field tests with synthesized sounds and ground-based vehicles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21204","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21204","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21205","fieldValue":" A new application architecture is designed for continuous, real-time, distributed wireless sensor networks. We develop a wireless sensor network for machinery condition-based maintenance (CBM) in small machinery spaces using commercially available products. We develop a hardware platform, networking architecture, and medium access communication protocol. We implement a single-hop sensor network to facilitate real-time monitoring and extensive data processing for machine monitoring. A new radio battery consumption model is presented and the battery consumption equation is used to select the most suitable topology and design an energy efficient communication protocol for wireless sensor networks. A new streamlined matrix formulation is developed that allows the base station to compute the best periodic sleep times for all the nodes in the network. We combine scheduling and contention to design a hybrid MAC protocol, which achieves 100&percnt; collision avoidance by using our modified RTS-CTS contention mechanism known as UC-TDMA protocol. A LabVIEW graphical user interface is described that allows for signal processing, including FFT, various moments, and kurtosis. A wireless CBM sensor network implementation on a heating and air conditioning plant is presented as a case study."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21205","fieldValue":"TDMA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21206","fieldValue":" Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed for diverse monitoring applications. Event data are collected at various sensors and sent to selected storage nodes for further in-network processing. Since sensor nodes have strong constraints on their energy usage, this data transfer needs to be energy-efficient to maximize network lifetime. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for trading energy versus latency in sensor database systems. We propose a new protocol that carefully schedules message transmissions so as to avoid collisions at the MAC layer. Since all nodes adhere to the schedule, their radios can be off most of the time and only wake up during well-defined time intervals. We show how routing protocols can be optimized to interact symbiotically with scheduling decisions, resulting in significant energy savings at the cost of higher latency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by means of a thorough simulation study, using synthetic data as well as real-world traffic workloads."}
