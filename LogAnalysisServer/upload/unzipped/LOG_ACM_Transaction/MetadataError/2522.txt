{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18525","fieldValue":" Many planning methods are based on mathematical modeling. A multitude of computer aids covers different facets of the planning activity: data management, linear programming, statistical analysis, graphics, and word processing. However, the diversity and complexity of the available software inhibit the widespread use of computers for planning.The integrated Computer-Aided Modeling and Planning (CAMP) system offers a simple and coherent tool for the planner. A Data Definition Language provides the means for building data banks; a Model Definition Language provides the means for defining mathematical models featuring abstract linear programming, advanced array arithmetics, and assertions; a Picture Definition Language facilitates formation of tables and diagrams; a Text Definition Language combines word processing with illustrations of modeling results. The man-machine interface is based on interactive panels for controlling the planning process and on a command language for analyzing modeling results. A multilingual capability allows selection of the national language for interfacing with the system.The architecture of CAMP is presented, and its design, implementation, and use in regional planning are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_MULTIPLE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18526","fieldValue":"Liu, Joseph W  H"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/18526","fieldValue":"Liu, Joseph W  H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18526","fieldValue":" Two techniques are introduced to reduce the working storage requirement for the recent multifrontal method of Duff and Reid used in the sparse out-of-core factorization of symmetric matrices. For a given core size, the reduction in working storage allows some large problems to be solved without having to use auxiliary storage for the working arrays. Even if the working arrays exceed the core size, it will reduce the amount of input-output traffic necessary to manipulate the working vectors. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate significant storage reduction on practical problems using the proposed techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18527","fieldValue":" This algorithm is a package of subroutines for Computing Bessel functions Hv(1)(z), Hv(2)(z), Iv(z), Jv(z), Kv(z), Yv(z) and Airy functions Ai(z), Aiâ\u20AC²(z), Bi(z), Biâ\u20AC²(z) for ordersvâ\u2030¥0 and complex z in âˆ\u2019Ï\u20AC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18527","fieldValue":"ACM"}
