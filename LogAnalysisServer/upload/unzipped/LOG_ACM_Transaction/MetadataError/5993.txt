Therefore, this research explores automated cognitive computational analysis of the information architecture of large websites as a basis for improvement. To support goal-specific analysis, an enhanced model of web navigation was implemented with a novel database-oriented approach. Web navigation was simulated on the information architecture of two large sites. With the improved labeling system of the information architecture, simulation results showed a significant reduction in navigation problems. The results of two experiments demonstrate that sites with improved information architecture result in better outcomes of user information retrieval. Our database-oriented approach is extensible, allowing non-goal-specific analysis, modeling of nontext media content, and analysis of the organization- and navigation systems of information architectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5898","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5898","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1496","fieldValue":" The ability to gather information online has become increasingly important in the past decades. Previous research suggests that people with cognitive disabilities experience challenges when finding information on websites. Although a number of studies examined the impact of various design guidelines on information search by people with cognitive disabilities, our knowledge in this topic remains limited. To date, no study has been conducted to examine how people with cognitive disabilities navigate in different content structures. We completed an empirical study to investigate the impact of different search methods and content structures on the search behavior of people with cognitive disabilities. 23 participants with various cognitive disabilities completed 15 information search tasks under three conditions: browsing a website with a deep structure (4 Ã\u2014 4 Ã\u2014 4 Ã\u2014 4), browsing a website with a broad structure (16 Ã\u2014 16), and searching through a search engine. The results suggest that the participants overwhelmingly preferred the search engine method to the two browsing conditions. The broad structure resulted in significantly higher failure rates than the search engine condition and the deep structure condition. The causes of failed search tasks were analyzed in detail. Participants frequently visited incorrect categories in both the deep structure and the broad structure conditions. However, it was more difficult to recover from incorrect categories on the lower-level pages in the broad structure than in the deep structure. Under the search engine condition, failed tasks were mainly caused by difficulty in selecting the correct link from the returned list, misspellings, and difficulty in generating appropriate search keywords."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5899","fieldValue":" We examine the recent move from a rhetoric of â\u20ACœusersâ\u20AC? toward one of â\u20ACœmakers,â\u20AC? â\u20ACœcrafters,â\u20AC? and â\u20ACœhackersâ\u20AC? within HCI discourse. Through our analysis, we make several contributions. First, we provide a general overview of the structure and common framings within research on makers. We discuss how these statements reconfigure themes of empowerment and progress that have been central to HCI rhetoric since the field's inception. In the latter part of the article, we discuss the consequences of these shifts for contemporary research problems. In particular, we explore the problem of designed obsolescence, a core issue for Sustainable Interaction Design (SID) research. We show how the framing of the maker, as an empowered subject, presents certain opportunities and limitations for this research discourse. Finally, we offer alternative framings of empowerment that can expand maker discourse and its use in contemporary research problems such as SID."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5899","fieldValue":"DIY"}
