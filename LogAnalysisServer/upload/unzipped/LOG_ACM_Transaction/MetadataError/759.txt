To determine an accurate temperature profile, it is important to simulate a die together with its thermal mounts: this requires solving Poisson's equation on a nonrectangular 3D domain. This article presents a class of eigendecomposition-based Fast Poisson Solvers (FPS) for chip-level thermal analysis. We start with a solver that solves a rectangular 3D domain with mixed boundary conditions in O(Nแนก logN) time, where N is the dimension of the finite difference matrix. Then we reveal, for the first time in the literature, a strong relation between fast Poisson solvers and Green-function-based methods. Finally, we propose an FPS method that leverages the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to solve nonrectangular 3D domains efficiently. We demonstrate this approach on thermal analysis of an industrial microprocessor, showing accurate results verified by a commercial tool, and that it solves a system of dimension 4.54e6 in only 13 conjugate gradient iterations, with a runtime of 65 seconds, a 15X speedup over the popular ICCG solver."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13275","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13275","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13276","fieldValue":" Clock meshes are extremely effective at producing low-skew regional clock networks that are tolerant of environmental and process variations. For this reason, clock meshes are used in most high-performance designs, but this robustness consumes significant power. In this work, we present two techniques to optimize high-performance clock meshes. The first technique is a mesh perturbation methodology for nonuniform mesh routing. The second technique is a skew-aware buffer placement through iterative buffer deletion. We demonstrate how these optimizations can achieve significant power reductions and a near elimination of short-circuit power. In addition, the total wire length is decreased, the number of required buffers is decreased, and both skew and robustness are improved on average when variation is considered."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13277","fieldValue":"Lin, Kuan-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13277","fieldValue":"Lin, Hong-Ting"}
