This framework dynamically adjusts the CPU voltage\/frequency so that no task in the system misses its deadline and the total energy savings of the system are maximized. In this paper, we consider only realistic, discrete-level speeds.Each task in the system consumes a certain amount of energy, which depends on a speed chosen for execution. The process of selecting speeds for execution while maximizing the energy savings of the system requires the exploration of a large number of combinations, which is too time consuming to be computed online. Thus, we propose an integrated heuristic methodology, which executes an optimization procedure in a low computation time. This scheme allows the scheduler to handle power-aware real-time tasks with low cost while maximizing the use of the available resources and without jeopardizing the temporal constraints of the system. Simulation results show that our heuristic methodology is able to generate power-aware scheduling solutions with near-optimal performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6232","fieldValue":" As mobile computing is getting popular, there is a growing need for techniques that minimize energy consumption on battery-powered mobile devices. Processor voltage scheduling can effectively reduce processor energy consumption by lowering the processor speed. In this paper, we study voltage scheduling for real-time periodic tasks with non-preemptible sections. Three schemes are proposed: The static speed algorithm derives the minimum static feasible speed based on the stack resource policy. Due to blocking, this static speed is usually higher than the speed required for scheduling fully preemptible tasks (called the utilization speed). Two dynamic speed algorithms are then introduced to further reduce energy consumption. The novel dual speed algorithm operates the processor at the utilization speed whenever possible and switches to the higher static speed only when blocking occurs. The dual speed dynamic reclaiming algorithm reserves time budget for each job, reclaims the unused time budget from completed jobs and redistributes it to subsequent jobs so they can run at a lower speed whenever possible. Feasibility conditions for real-time task sets have been derived and proved mathematically. Simulation results show that the proposed voltage scheduling algorithms dramatically reduce processor energy consumption over non-power-aware scheduling algorithms. Furthermore, the two dynamic speed algorithms consistently outperform the static speed scheme in a wide range of system and workload conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6232","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6232","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6233","fieldValue":" Safety-critical embedded systems often operate in harsh environmental conditions that necessitate fault-tolerant computing techniques. In addition, many safety-critical systems execute real-time applications that require strict adherence to task deadlines. These embedded systems are also energy-constrained, since system lifetime is determined largely by the battery lifetime. In this paper, we investigate dynamic adaptation techniques based on checkpointing and dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) for fault tolerance and power management. We first present schedulability tests that provide the criteria under which checkpointing can provide fault tolerance and real-time guarantees. We then present an adaptive checkpointing scheme in which the checkpointing interval for a task is dynamically adjusted during execution, and checkpoints are inserted based not only on the available slack, but also on the occurrences of faults. Next, we combine adaptive checkpointing with DVS to achieve power reduction. Finally, we develop an adaptive checkpointing scheme for a set of multiple tasks in real-time systems. An offline preprocessing based on linear programming is used to determine the parameters that are provided as inputs to the online adaptive checkpointing procedure. Simulation results show that compared to previous methods, the proposed adaptive checkpointing approach increases the likelihood of timely task completion in the presence of faults. When combined with DVS, adaptive checkpointing also leads to considerable energy savings."}
