{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12703","fieldValue":" We consider a board-level routing problem applicable to FPGA-based logic emulation systems such as the Realizer System [Varghese et al. 1993] and the Enterprise Emulation System [Maliniak 1992] manufactured by Quickturn Design Systems. Optimal algorithms have been proposed for the case where all nets are two-terminal nets [Chan and Schlag 1993; Mak and Wong 1995]. We show how multiterminal nets can be handled by decomposition into two-terminal nets. We show that the multiterminal net decomposition problem can be modeled as a bounded-degree hypergraph-to-graph transformation problem where hyperedges are transformed to spanning trees. A network flow-based algorithm that solves both problems is proposed. It determines if there is a feasible decomposition and gives one whenever such a decomposition exists."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12703","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12703","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12704","fieldValue":" We give new methods for calculating the time-domain response for a finite-length distributed RC line that is stimulated by a ramp input. The following are our contributions. First, we obtain the solution of the diffusion equation for a seminfinite distributed RC line with ramp input. We then present a general and, in the limit, exact approach to compute the time-domain response for finite-length RC lines under ramp input by summing distinct diffusions starting at either end of the line. Next, we obtain analytical expressions for the finite time-domain voltage response for an open-ended finite RC line and for a finite RC line with capacitive load. The delay estimates using this method are very close to SPICE-computing delays. Finally, we present a general recursive equation for computing the higher-order diffusion components due to reflections at the source and load ends. Future work extends our method to response computations in general interconnection trees by modeling both reflection and transmission coefficients at discontinuities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12704","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12704","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12705","fieldValue":"De Micheli, Giovanni"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12705","fieldValue":" When binding a logic network to a set of cells, a fundamental problem is recognizing whether a cell can implement a portion of the network. Boolean matching means solving this task using a formalism based on Boolean algebra. In its simplest form, Boolean matching can be posed as a tautology check. We review several approaches to Boolean matching as well as to its generalization to cases involving don't care conditions and its restriction to specific libraries such as those typical of anti-fuse based FPGAs. We then present a general formulation of Boolean matching supporting multiple-output logic cells."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12705","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12705","fieldValue":"ACM"}
