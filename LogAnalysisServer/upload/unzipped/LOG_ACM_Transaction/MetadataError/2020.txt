Unlike the existing works on sketch-based search and composition of 3D models, which typically process individual sketched objects one by one, our technique performs co-retrieval and co-placement of 3D relevant models by jointly processing the sketched objects. This is enabled by summarizing functional and spatial relationships among models in a large collection of 3D scenes as structural groups. Our technique greatly reduces the amount of user intervention needed for sketch-based modeling of 3D scenes and fits well into the traditional production pipeline involving concept design followed by 3D modeling. A pilot study indicates that it is promising to use our technique as an alternative but more efficient tool of standard 3D modeling for 3D scene construction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16904","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16904","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16905","fieldValue":" Weighted linear interpolation has been widely used in many skinning techniques including linear blend skinning, dual quaternion blend skinning, and cage based deformation. To speed up performance, these skinning models typically employ a sparseness constraint, in which each 3D model vertex has a small fixed number of non-zero weights. However, the sparseness constraint also imposes certain limitations to skinning models and their various applications. This paper introduces an efficient two-layer sparse compression technique to substantially reduce the computational cost of a dense-weight skinning model, with insignificant loss of its visual quality. It can directly work on dense skinning weights or use example-based skinning decomposition to further improve its accuracy. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate that the introduced sparse compression model can significantly outperform state of the art weight reduction algorithms, as well as skinning decomposition algorithms with a sparseness constraint."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16905","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16905","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16906","fieldValue":"Cani, Marie-Paule"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16906","fieldValue":" Geometric skinning techniques, such as smooth blending or dual-quaternions, are very popular in the industry for their high performances, but fail to mimic realistic deformations. Other methods make use of physical simulation or control volume to better capture the skin behavior, yet they cannot deliver real-time feedback. In this paper, we present the first purely geometric method handling skin contact effects and muscular bulges in real-time. The insight is to exploit the advanced composition mechanism of volumetric, implicit representations for correcting the results of geometric skinning techniques. The mesh is first approximated by a set of implicit surfaces. At each animation step, these surfaces are combined in real-time and used to adjust the position of mesh vertices, starting from their smooth skinning position. This deformation step is done without any loss of detail and seamlessly handles contacts between skin parts. As it acts as a post-process, our method fits well into the standard animation pipeline. Moreover, it requires no intensive computation step such as collision detection, and therefore provides real-time performances."}
