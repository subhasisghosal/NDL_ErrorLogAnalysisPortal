{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24842","fieldValue":" We present procedures for selecting the best or near-best of a finite number of simulated systems when best is defined by maximum or minimum expected performance. The procedures are appropriate when it is possible to repeatedly obtain small, incremental samples from each simulated system. The goal of such a sequential procedure is to eliminate, at an early stage of experimentation, those simulated systems that are apparently inferior, and thereby reduce the overall computational effort required to find the best. The procedures we present accommodate unequal variances across systems and the use of common random numbers. However, they are based on the assumption of normally distributed data, so we analyze the impact of batching (to achieve approximate normality or independence) on the performance of the procedures. Comparisons with some existing indifference-zone procedures are also provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24842","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24842","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24843","fieldValue":"Orozco-Barbosa, Luis"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24843","fieldValue":" A technique for the fast simulation of broadband communication systems is proposed, which is based on regenerative Importance Sampling techniques and on large-deviation results. Our algorithm is applicable to estimate the probability of rare events when modeling the offered traffic using Fractional Stable Noise (FSN) processes (including Fractional Gaussian Noise as a particular case), which have been recently proved to be able to capture both the long-range dependence and the burstiness of today's aggregate network traffic. An exact description of FSN processes is given, as well as an approximation that allows for the application of Importance Sampling techniques. The results obtained for a simple example are also included."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24843","fieldValue":"Fast simulation of broadband telecommunications networks carrying long-range dependent bursty traffic"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24843","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24843","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24844","fieldValue":" This article deals with the compound methods with modulus m for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers, which have been introduced recently. Equidistribution and statistical independence properties of the generated sequences over part of the period are studied based on the discrepancy of d-tuples of successive pseudorandom numbers. It is shown that there exist parameters in compound methods such that the discrepancy over part of the period of the corresponding point sets in the d-dimensional unit cube is of an order magnitude of $O(N^-1\/2 (log N)d+3$) for all N=1, â\u20AC¦, m.
