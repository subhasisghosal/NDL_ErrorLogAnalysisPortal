However, multipartition, multioperation transactional access is often expensive, employing coordination-intensive locking, validation, or scheduling mechanisms. Accordingly, many real-world systems avoid mechanisms that provide useful semantics for multipartition operations. This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of applications including secondary indexing, foreign key enforcement, and materialized view maintenance. In this work, we identify a new isolation modelâ\u20AC\u201DRead Atomic (RA) isolationâ\u20AC\u201Dthat matches the requirements of these use cases by ensuring atomic visibility: either all or none of each transactionâ\u20AC™s updates are observed by other transactions. We present algorithms for Read Atomic Multipartition (RAMP) transactions that enforce atomic visibility while offering excellent scalability, guaranteed commit despite partial failures (via coordination-free execution), and minimized communication between servers (via partition independence). These RAMP transactions correctly mediate atomic visibility of updates and provide readers with snapshot access to database state by using limited multiversioning and by allowing clients to independently resolve nonatomic reads. We demonstrate that, in contrast with existing algorithms, RAMP transactions incur limited overheadâ\u20AC\u201Deven under high contentionâ\u20AC\u201Dand scale linearly to 100 servers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14692","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14692","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14693","fieldValue":"To, Quoc-Cuong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14693","fieldValue":" Current applications, from complex sensor systems (e.g., quantified self) to online e-markets, acquire vast quantities of personal information that usually end up on central servers where they are exposed to prying eyes. Conversely, decentralized architectures that help individuals keep full control of their data complexify global treatments and queries, impeding the development of innovative services. This article aims precisely at reconciling individual's privacy on one side and global benefits for the community and business perspectives on the other. It promotes the idea of pushing the security to secure hardware devices controlling the data at the place of their acquisition. Thanks to these tangible physical elements of trust, secure distributed querying protocols can reestablish the capacity to perform global computations, such as Structured Query Language (SQL) aggregates, without revealing any sensitive information to central servers. This article studies how to secure the execution of such queries in the presence of honest-but-curious and malicious attackers. It also discusses how the resulting querying protocols can be integrated in a concrete decentralized architecture. Cost models and experiments on SQL\/Asymmetric Architecture (AA), our distributed prototype running on real tamper-resistant hardware, demonstrate that this approach can scale to nationwide applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14694","fieldValue":"Tan, Wang-Chiew"}
