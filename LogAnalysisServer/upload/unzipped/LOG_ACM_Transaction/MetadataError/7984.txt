{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10786","fieldValue":" Current IEEE 802.11 WLANs suffer from the well-known rate anomaly problem, which can drastically reduce network performance. Opportunistic relaying can address this problem, but three major considerations, typically considered separately by prior work, need to be taken into account for an efficient deployment in real-world systems: 1) relaying could imply increased power consumption, and nodes might be heterogeneous, both in power source (e.g., battery-powered versus socket-powered) and power consumption profile; 2) similarly, nodes in the network are expected to have heterogeneous throughput needs and preferences in terms of the throughput versus energy consumption tradeoff; and 3) any proposed solution should be backwards-compatible, given the large number of legacy 802.11 devices already present in existing networks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Self-Optimizing, Legacy-Compatible Opportunistic Relaying (SOLOR), which jointly takes into account the above considerations and greatly improves network performance even in systems comprised mostly of vanilla nodes and legacy access points. SOLOR jointly optimizes the topology of the network, i.e., which are the nodes associated to each relay-capable node; and the relay schedules, i.e., how the relays split time between the downstream nodes they relay for and the upstream flow to access points. Our results, obtained for a large variety of scenarios and different node preferences, illustrate the significant gains achieved by our approach. Specifically, SOLOR greatly improves network throughput performance (more than doubling it) and power consumption (up to 75% reduction) even in systems comprised mostly of vanilla nodes and legacy access points. Its feasibility is demonstrated through testbed experimentation in a realistic deployment."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10786","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10787","fieldValue":"Lee, Hyang-Won"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10787","fieldValue":" This paper presents a scheme in which a dedicated backup network is designed to provide protection from random link failures. Upon a link failure in the primary network, traffic is rerouted through a preplanned path in the backup network. We introduce a novel approach for dealing with random link failures, in which probabilistic survivability guarantees are provided to limit capacity overprovisioning. We show that the optimal backup routing strategy in this respect depends on the reliability of the primary network. Specifically, as primary links become less likely to fail, the optimal backup networks employ more resource sharing among backup paths. We apply results from the field of robust optimization to formulate an ILP for the design and capacity provisioning of these backup networks. We then propose a simulated annealing heuristic to solve this problem for large-scale networks and present simulation results that verify our analysis and approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10787","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10788","fieldValue":" A major concern in IP networks is to ensure that any topology changes, whether planned or unplanned, do not disrupt network performance. IP Fast Reroute (IP FRR) is a general approach to address this issue by promptly forwarding an IP packet to a predetermined alternate next-hop as soon as the primary next-hop to the destination becomes unavailable. Among the numerous IP FRR schemes proposed to date, the simplest ones do not guarantee protection against every component failure, while more sophisticated ones tend to be difficult to implement due to various inherent complexities, such as nontrivial modifications of IP packets or high resource requirements. This paper presents a simple and efficient IP FRR scheme called DisPath, which leverages several fundamental properties of minimum-cost node-disjoint paths for determining the alternate next-hop toward a given destination. We show that DisPath ensures full coverage, meaning protection against all single link or node failures, with low computational overhead and without the practical complications encountered by other schemes that offer the same level of protection. Our simulations on several realistic instances reveal that DisPath usually creates shorter (and, at worst, not much longer) alternative paths than existing solutions adopted by the industry. Combined with the aforementioned protection guarantee and simplicity of implementation, these results provide strong evidence that DisPath is a most compelling choice of IP FRR scheme."}
