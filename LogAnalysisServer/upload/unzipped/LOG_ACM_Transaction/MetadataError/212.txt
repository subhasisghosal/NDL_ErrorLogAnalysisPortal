We introduce \u20ACfree valuations\u20AC? to capture this dynamics of a propositional statement's environment. The resulting logic is phrased as an equationally specified algebra rather than in the form of proof rules, and is named \u20ACproposition algebra.\u20AC? It is strictly more general than Boolean algebra to the extent that the classical connectives fail to be expressively complete in the sequential case. The four axioms for free valuation congruence are then combined with other axioms in order define a few more valuation congruences that gradually identify more propositional statements, up to static valuation congruence (which is the setting of conventional propositional logic). Proposition algebra is developed in a fashion similar to the process algebra ACP and the program algebra PGA, via an algebraic specification which has a meaningful initial algebra for which a range of coarser congruences are considered important as well. In addition, infinite objects (i.e., propositional statements, processes and programs respectively) are dealt with by means of an inverse limit construction which allows the transfer of knowledge concerning finite objects to facts about infinite ones while reducing all facts about infinite objects to an infinity of facts about finite ones in return."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11612","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11612","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11613","fieldValue":" Multiary sequent terms were originally introduced as a tool for proving termination of permutative conversions in cut-free sequent calculus. This work develops the language of multiary sequent terms into a term calculus for the computational (Curry-Howard) interpretation of a fragment of sequent calculus with cuts and cut-elimination rules. The system, called generalized multiary 位-calculus, is a rich extension of the 位-calculus where the computational content of the sequent calculus format is explained through an enlarged form of the application constructor. Such constructor exhibits the features of multiarity (the ability to form lists of arguments) and generality (the ability to prescribe a kind of continuation). The system integrates in a modular way the multiary 位-calculus and an isomorphic copy of the 位-calculus with generalized application, \u203A J (in particular, natural deduction is captured internally up to isomorphism). In addition, the system: (i) comes with permutative conversion rules, whose role is to eliminate the new features of application; (ii) is equipped with reduction rules \u20AC\u201D either the 渭-rule, typical of the multiary setting, or rules for cut-elimination, which enlarge the ordinary 尾-rule. This article establishes the metatheory of the system, with emphasis on the role of the 渭-rule, and including a study of the interaction of reduction and permutative conversions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11613","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11613","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11614","fieldValue":" We study a system, called NEL, which is the mixed commutative\/noncommutative linear logic BV augmented with linear logic's exponentials.
