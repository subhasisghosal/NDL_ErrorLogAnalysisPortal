{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24159","fieldValue":" Given a query document, ranking the documents in a collection based on how similar they are to the query is an essential task with extensive applications. For collections that contain documents whose creation dates span several decades, this task is further complicated by the fact that the language changes over time. For example, many terms add or lose one or more senses to meet peopleâ\u20AC™s evolving needs. To address this problem, we present methods that take advantage of two types of information to account for the language change. The first is the citation network that often exists within the collection, which can be used to link related documents with significantly different creation dates (and hence different language use). The second is the changes in the usage frequency of terms that occur over time, which can indicate changes in their senses and uses. These methods utilize the preceding information while estimating the representation of both documents and terms within the context of nonprobabilistic static and dynamic topic models. Our experiments on two real-world datasets that span more than 40 years show that our proposed methods improve the retrieval performance of existing models and that these improvements are statistically significant."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24159","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24159","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24160","fieldValue":" Aggregated search is the task of combining results from multiple independent search systems in a single Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Aggregated search coherence refers to the extent to which different sources on the SERP focus on similar senses of an ambiguous or underspecified query. In previous studies, we found that the query senses in a set of vertical results can influence user engagement with the web results (the so-called â\u20ACœspilloverâ\u20AC? effect). In this work, we investigate five research questions (RQ1--RQ5) that extend our prior work. First, we investigate the extent to which results from different sources focus on different senses of an ambiguous query (RQ1). Second, we investigate how the vertical-to-web spillover effect varies across different verticals (RQ2). Then, we examine whether the level of spillover depends on the vertical position (RQ3) and on whether the vertical results are displayed with a border and different-colored background to distinguish them from the web results (RQ4). Finally, we propose a new method for displaying results from a particular vertical that are more consistent with the query senses in the web results (RQ5). We evaluate this new method based on how it influences users to make more correct decisions with respect to the web resultsâ\u20AC\u201Dto engage with the web results when at least one of them is relevant and to avoid engaging with the web results otherwise. Our results show the following trends. In terms of RQ1, our analysis suggests that the top results from the web search engine are more diversified than the top results from our four different verticals considered (images, news, shopping, and video). In terms of RQ2, we found a stronger spillover effect for the images vertical than the news, shopping, and video verticals. In terms of RQ3, we found a stronger level of spillover when the vertical was positioned at the top of the SERP versus to the right side of the web results. In terms of RQ4, we found an interesting additive effect between the verticalâ\u20AC™s position and displaying the vertical results enclosed in a border and with a different-colored backgroundâ\u20AC\u201Dthe image vertical had no spillover when presented to the right side of the web results and with a border and background. Finally, in terms of RQ5, we found that our proposed vertical results selection approach can influence users to make more correct predictions about their level of engagement with the web results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24160","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24160","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24161","fieldValue":" Technology progress is one of the key reasons behind today's rapid changes in lifestyles. Knowing how products and objects evolve can not only help with understanding the evolutionary patterns in our society but can also provide clues on effective product design and can offer support for predicting the future. We propose a general framework for analyzing technology's impact on our lives through detecting cause--effect relationships, where causes represent changes in technology while effects are changes in social life, such as new activities or new ways of using products. We address the challenge of viewing technology evolution through the â\u20ACœsocial impact lensâ\u20AC? by mining causal relationships from the long-term collections of product reviews. In particular, we first propose dividing vocabulary into two groups: terms describing product features (called physical terms) and terms representing product usage (called conceptual terms). We then search for two kinds of changes related to the appearance of terms: frequency-based and context-based changes. The former indicate periods when a word was significantly more frequently used, whereas the latter indicate periods of high change in the word's context. Based on the detected changes, we then search for causal term pairs such that the change in the physical term triggers the change in the conceptual term. We next extend our approach to finding causal relationships between word groups such as a group of words representing the same technology and causing a given conceptual change or group of words representing two different technologies that simultaneously â\u20ACœco-causeâ\u20AC? a conceptual change. We conduct experiments on different product types using the Amazon Product Review Dataset, which spans 1995 to 2013, and we demonstrate that our approaches outperform state-of-the-art baselines."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24161","fieldValue":"Causal Relationship Detection in Archival Collections of Product Reviews for Understanding Technology Evolution"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24161","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24161","fieldValue":"ACM"}
