For the recognition problem, we reduce the time complexity from $O(mn^2) to O(m2) and the space complexity from O(n3) to O(m &plus; n), and also produce a hole or antihole if the input graph is not weakly chordal. For the optimization problems, the complexity of the clique and coloring problems is reduced from O(mn2) to O(n3) and the complexity of the independent set and clique cover problems is improved from O(n4$) to O(mn).

Reliability is characterized by Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) for which two analytic models are proposed. A simple model, similar to the one traditionally used for memories protected with scrubbing, is proposed for the low error rate case. A more complex Markov model is proposed for the high error rate case. The accuracy of the models is checked using a wide set of simulations. The results presented in this article allow fast estimation of MTTF enabling design of optimal memory configurations to meet specified MTTF goals at minimum cost. Additionally the power consumption of memories protected with BICS is compared to that of memories using scrubbing in terms of the number of read cycles needed in both configurations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13177","fieldValue":"ACM"}
