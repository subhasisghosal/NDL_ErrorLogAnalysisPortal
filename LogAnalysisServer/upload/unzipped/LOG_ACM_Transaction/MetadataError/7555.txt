Preconfiguring the network in a traffic-independent manner using two-phase routing simplifies network operation considerably. In this paper, we extend this routing scheme by providing resiliency against link failures through fast path restoration along disjoint end-to-end backup paths. We view this as important progress toward adding carrier-class reliability to the robustness of the scheme so as to facilitate its future deployment in Internet service provider (ISP) networks. On the theoretical side, the main contribution of the paper is the development of linear-programming-based and fast combinatorial algorithms for two-phase routing with fast path restoration so as to minimize the maximum utilization of any link in the network, or equivalently, maximize the throughput. The algorithms developed are fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS)-for any given ε > 0, an FPTAS guarantees a solution that is within a (1 + ε)-factor of the optimum and runs in time polynomial in the input size and 1\/ε. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature that considers making the scheme resilient to link failures through preprovisioned fast restoration mechanisms. We evaluate the performance of fast path restoration (in terms of throughput) and compare it to that of unprotected routing. For our experiments, we use actual ISP network topologies collected for the Rocketfuel project and three research network topologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9917","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9917","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9917","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9918","fieldValue":" We study oblivious routing in fat-tree-based system area networks with deterministic routing under the assumption that the traffic demand is uncertain. The performance of a routing algorithm under uncertain traffic demands is characterized by the oblivious performance ratio that bounds the relative performance of the routing algorithm with respect to the optimal algorithm for any given traffic demand. We consider both single-path routing, where only one path is used to carry the traffic between each source-destination pair, and multipath routing, where multiple paths are allowed. For single-path routing, we derive lower bounds of the oblivious performance ratio for different fat-trees and develop routing schemes that achieve the optimal oblivious performance ratios for commonly used topologies. Our evaluation results indicate that the proposed oblivious routing schemes not only provide the optimal worst-case performance guarantees but also outperform existing schemes in average cases. For multipath routing, we show that it is possible to obtain an optimal scheme for all traffic demands (an oblivious performance ratio of 1). These results quantitatively demonstrate the performance difference between single-path routing and multipath routing in fat-trees."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9918","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9919","fieldValue":" Nash bargaining and proportional fairness are popular strategies for distributing resources among competing users. Under the conventional assumption of a convex compact utility set, both techniques yield the same unique solution. In this paper, we show that uniqueness is preserved for a broader class of logarithmically convex sets. Then, we study a scenario where the performance of each user is measured by its signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). The SIR is modeled by an axiomatic framework of log-convex interference functions. No power constraints are assumed. It is shown how existence and uniqueness of a proportionally fair optimizer depends on the interference coupling among the users. Finally, we analyze the feasible SIR set. Conditions are derived under which the Nash bargaining strategy has a single-valued solution."}
