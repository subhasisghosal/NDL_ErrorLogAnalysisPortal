Using extensive experiments on four different corpora, we show that incorporating bigram collocations in the document representation creates more parsimonious models and improves topic coherence. We point out some problems in interpreting test likelihood and test perplexity to compare model fit, and suggest an alternate measure that penalizes model complexity. We show how the Akaike information criterion is a more appropriate measure, which suggests that using a modest number (up to 1000) of top-ranked bigrams is the optimal topic modelling configuration. Using these 1000 bigrams also results in improved topic quality over unigram tokenization. Further increases in topic quality can be achieved by using up to 10,000 bigrams, but this is at the cost of a more complex model. We also show that multiword (bigram and longer) named entities give consistent results, indicating that they should be represented as single tokens. This is the first work to explicitly study the effect of n-gram tokenization on LDA topic models, and the first work to make empirical recommendations to topic modelling practitioners, challenging the standard practice of unigram-based tokenization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23091","fieldValue":" The use of figurative language is ubiquitous in natural language texts and it is a serious bottleneck in automatic text understanding. A system capable of interpreting figurative expressions would be an invaluable addition to the real-world natural language processing (NLP) applications that need to access semantics, such as machine translation, opinion mining, question answering and many others. In this article we focus on one type of figurative language, logical metonymy, and present a computational model of its interpretation bringing together statistical techniques and the insights from linguistic theory. Compared to previous approaches this model is both more informative and more accurate. The system produces sense-level interpretations of metonymic phrases and then automatically organizes them into conceptual classes, or roles, discussed in the majority of linguistic literature on the phenomenon."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23091","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23091","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23092","fieldValue":" The property of idiomaticity vs. compositionality of a multiword expression traditionally pertains to the semantic interpretation of the expression. In this article, we consider this property as it applies to the expression's sentiment profile (relative degree of positivity, negativity, and neutrality). Thus, while heart attack is idiomatic in terms of semantic interpretation, the sentiment profile of the expression (strongly negative) can, in fact, be determined from the strongly negative profile of the head word. In this article, we (1) propose a way to measure compositionality of a multiword expression's sentiment profile, and perform the measurement on noun-noun compounds; (2) evaluate the utility of using sentiment profiles of noun-noun compounds in a sentence-level sentiment classification task. We find that the sentiment profiles of noun-noun compounds in test-taker essays tend to be highly compositional and that their incorporation improves the performance of a sentiment classification system."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23092","fieldValue":"MWE"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23092","fieldValue":"ACM"}
