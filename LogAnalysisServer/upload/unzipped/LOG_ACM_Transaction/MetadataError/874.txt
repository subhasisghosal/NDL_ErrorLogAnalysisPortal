{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13528","fieldValue":" In this article, we investigate a hierarchical statistical leakage analysis (HSLA) design flow where module-level statistical leakage models supplied by IP vendors are used to improve the efficiency and capacity of SoC statistical leakage power analysis. To solve the challenges of incorporating spatial correlations between IP modules at system level, we first propose a method to extract correlation-inclusive leakage models. Then a method to handle the spatial correlations at system level is proposed. Using this method, the runtime of system statistical leakage analysis (SLA) can be significantly improved without disclosing the netlists of the IP modules. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HSLA method is about 100 times faster than gate-level full-chip SLA methods while maintaining the accuracy. In addition, we also investigate one application of this HSLA method, a leakage-yield-driven floorplanning framework, to demonstrate the benefits of such an HSLA method in practice. Moreover, an optimized hierarchical leakage analysis method dedicated to the floorplanning framework is proposed. The effectiveness of the floorplanning framework and the optimized method are confirmed by extensive experimental results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13529","fieldValue":"S, Ramprasath"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13529","fieldValue":" In this article, we derive a simple and accurate expression for the change in timing yield due to a change in the gate delay distribution. It is based on analytical bounds that we have derived for the moments of the circuit and path delay. Based on this, we propose computationally efficient algorithms for (1) discrete gate sizing and (2) simultaneous gate sizing and threshold voltage $(V^T) assignment so that the circuit meets a timing yield specification under parameter variations. The use of this analytical yield gradient within a gradient-based timing yield optimization algorithm results in a significant improvement in the runtime as compared to the numerical method, while achieving the same final yield. It also allows us to explore a larger search space in each iteration more efficiently, which is required in the case of simultaneous resizing and VT assignment. We also propose heuristics for resizing\/changing the VT$ of multiple gates in each iteration. This makes it possible to optimize the timing yield for large circuits. Results on ITC â\u20AC™99 benchmarks show that the proposed multinode resizing algorithm results in a significant improvement in the runtime with a marginal average area penalty and no cost to the final yield achieved."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/13529","fieldValue":"<i>V<sup>T<\/sup><\/i> assignment"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13529","fieldValue":"Efficient Algorithms for Discrete Gate Sizing and Threshold Voltage Assignment Based on an Accurate Analytical Statistical Yield Gradient"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13530","fieldValue":"Blanton, R D Shawn"}
