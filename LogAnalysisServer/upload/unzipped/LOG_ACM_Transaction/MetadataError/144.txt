{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11433","fieldValue":" This article provides a modal logic framework for reasoning about multi-agent belief and its fusion. We propose logics for reasoning about cautiously merged agent beliefs that have different degrees of reliability. These logics are obtained by combining the multi-agent epistemic logic and multi-source reasoning systems. The fusion is cautious in the sense that if an agent's belief is in conflict with those of higher priorities, then his belief is completely discarded from the merged result. We consider two strategies for the cautious merging of beliefs. In the first, called level cutting fusion, if inconsistency occurs at some level, then all beliefs at the lower levels are discarded simultaneously. In the second, called level skipping fusion, only the level at which the inconsistency occurs is skipped. We present the formal semantics and axiomatic systems for these two strategies and discuss some applications of the proposed logical systems. We also develop a tableau proof system for the logics and prove the complexity result for the satisfiability and validity problems of these logics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11434","fieldValue":"Hesselink, Wim H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11434","fieldValue":" Simulations of specifications are introduced as a unification and generalization of refinement mappings, history variables, forward simulations, prophecy variables, and backward simulations. A specification implements another specification if and only if there is a simulation from the first one to the second one that satisfies a certain condition. By adding stutterings, the formalism allows that the concrete behaviors take more (or possibly less) steps than the abstract ones.Eternity variables are introduced as a more powerful alternative for prophecy variables and backward simulations. This formalism is semantically complete: every simulation that preserves quiescence is a composition of a forward simulation, an extension with eternity variables, and a refinement mapping. This result does not need finite invisible nondeterminism and machine closure as in the Abadi--Lamport Theorem. The requirement of internal continuity is weakened to preservation of quiescence.Almost all concepts are illustrated by tiny examples or counter-examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11435","fieldValue":" Inductive logic programming (ILP) realizes inductive machine learning in computational logic. However, the present ILP mostly handles classical clausal programs, especially Horn logic programs, and has limited applications to learning nonmonotonic logic programs. This article studies a method for realizing induction in nonmonotonic logic programs. We consider an extended logic program as a background theory, and introduce techniques for inducing new rules using answer sets of the program. The produced new rules explain positive\/negative examples in the context of inductive logic programming. The proposed methods extend the present ILP techniques to a syntactically and semantically richer framework, and contribute to a theory of nonmonotonic ILP."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11435","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11435","fieldValue":"ACM"}
