There are no published models for real-time simulation of dust behavior generated by a traveling vehicle. In this paper, we use particle systems, computational fluid dynamics, and behavioral simulation techniques to simulate dust behavior in real time. First, we analyze the forces and factors that affect dust generation and the behavior after dust particles are generated. Then, we construct physically-based empirical models to generate dust particles and control the behavior accordingly. We further simplify the numerical calculations by dividing dust behavior into three stages, and establishing simplified particle system models for each stage. We employ motion blur, particle blending texture mapping, and other computer graphics techniques to achieve the final results. Our contributions include constructing physically-based empirical models to generate dust behavior and achieving simulation of the behavior in real time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24805","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24805","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24806","fieldValue":" Rare event simulation is an important area of simulation theory, producing algorithms that can significantly reduce the simulation time when analyzing problems that involve rare events. However, existing rare event simulation techniques are rather restrictive, i.e., applicable only to systems with modest complexity. In this paper, we first develop a Markov chain transformation theory that can redistribute steady-state probabilities in a finite-size discrete-time Markov chain in an arbitrary and controlled manner. We descriptively name the theoretical procedure â\u20ACœdirect probability redistributionâ\u20AC? (DPR). In the second part of the paper, we develop DPR theory into a simulation algorithm that uses trajectory splitting to realize the DPR effect without knowledge of the transition probability matrix, thus allowing for easy application to systems with realistic complexity. DPR-based splitting can significantly reduce the simulation time by increasing the visitng frequency of rare states, and it avoids the problems associated with the decreasing likelihood ratio, which can be a limitation in conventional Importance Sampling techniques. The main advantage of the DPR-based simulation technique over existing splitting techniques is that DPR does not impose any restrictions on the state transitions and it provides asymptotically unbiased estimates even if the rare event set overlaps many splitting partitions. We conclude by providing examples where DPR-based simulation has been successfully applied to nontrivial queuing problems, including a system with flow control."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24806","fieldValue":"DPR"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24806","fieldValue":"RESTART"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24807","fieldValue":" When we build a model of real-time systems, we need ways of representing the knowledge about the system and also time requirements for simulating the model. Considering these different needs, our question is â\u20ACœHow can we determine the optimal model that simulates the system by a given deadline while still producing valid outputs at an acceptable level of detail?â\u20AC? We have designed OOPM\/RT (Object-Oriented Physical Modeler for Real-Time Simulation) methodology. The OOPM\/RT framework has three phases: (1) Generation of multimodels in OOPM using both structural and behavioral abstraction techniques, (2) Generation of AT (Abstraction Tree) which organizes the multimodels based on the abstraction relationship to facilitate the optimal model selection process, and (3) Selection of the optimal model that guarantees the deliver simulation results by the given amount of time. A more-detailed model (low abstraction model) is selected when we have enough time to simulate, while a less-detailed model (high abstraction model) is selected when the deadline is immediate. The basic idea of selection is to trade structural information for a faster runtime while minimizing the loss of behavioral information. We propose two possible approaches for the selection: an integer-programming-based approach and a search-based approach. By systematically handling simulation deadlines while minimizing the modeler's interventions, OOPM\/RT provides an efficient modeling environment for real-time systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24807","fieldValue":"ACM"}
