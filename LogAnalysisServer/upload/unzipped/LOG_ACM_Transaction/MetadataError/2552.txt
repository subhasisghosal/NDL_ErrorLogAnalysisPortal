A bicubic Hermite polynomial f(x, y) is determined for every rectangle of the mesh, interpolating the zij and the derivatives zx, zy, and zxy. The derivatives are optionally computed by the algorithm. The contours found are normally smooth curves. They consist of polygons approximating intersections with the bicubics. It is possible to fill the areas between them with certain colors or patterns. This is done with a piecewise technique rectangle by rectangle. The method for finding the points of the polygons is shortly reviewed, and some numerical problems are pointed out. The algorithm has a flexible, easy-to-use interface and is easily installed with all plotting systems, provided that a fill-area command is available. A GKS interface may be used."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18609","fieldValue":" Although the theory of polynomial continuation has been established for over a decade (following the work of Garcia, Zangwill, and Drexler), it is difficult to solve polynomial systems using continuation in practice. Divergent paths (solutions at infinity), singular solutions, and extreme scaling of coefficients can create catastrophic numerical problems. Further, the large number of paths that typically arise can be discouraging. In this paper we summarize polynomial-solving homotopy continuation and report on the performance of three standard path-tracking algorithms (as implemented in HOMPACK) in solving three physical problems of varying degrees of difficulty. Our purpose is to provide useful information on solving polynomial systems, including specific guidelines for homotopy construction and parameter settings. The m-homogeneous strategy for constructing polynomial homotopies is outlined, along with more traditional approaches. Computational comparisons are included to illustrate and contrast the major HOMPACK options. The conclusions summarize our numerical experience and discuss areas for future research."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18609","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18609","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/18610","fieldValue":"Patterson, T.

It is of very wide application in that to operate, only the definition of the 3-term recurrence relation for the orthogonal polynomials associated with the weight function need be supplied. The algorithm can be used to produce specific individual quadrature rules or sequences of rules by iterative application."}
