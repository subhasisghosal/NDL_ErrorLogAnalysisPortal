{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19098","fieldValue":" High order domain decomposition methods using a basis of Legendre polynomials, known variously as â\u20ACœspectral elementsâ\u20AC? or â\u20ACœp-type finite elements,â\u20AC? have become very popular. Recent studies suggest that accuracy and efficiency can be improved by replacing Legendre polynomials by prolate spheroidal wave functions of zeroth order. In this article, we explain the practicalities of computing all the numbers needed to switch bases: the grid points $x_j, the quadrature weights wj, and the values of the prolate functions and their derivatives at the grid points. The prolate functions themselves are computed by a Legendre-Galerkin discretization of the prolate differential equation; this yields a symmetric tridiagonal matrix. The prolate functions are then defined by Legendre series whose coefficients are the eigenfunctions of the matrix eigenproblem. The grid points and weights are found simultaneously through a Newton iteration. For large N and c, the iteration diverges from a first guess of the Legendre-Lobatto points and weights. Fortunately, the variations of the xj and wj$ with c are well-approximated by a symmetric parabola over the whole range of interest. This makes it possible to bypass the continuation procedures of earlier authors."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19098","fieldValue":"<i>p<\/i>-finite elements"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19098","fieldValue":"<i>p<\/i>-finite elements"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19098","fieldValue":"Algorithm 840: computation of grid points, quadrature weights and derivatives for spectral element methods using prolate spheroidal wave functions---prolate elements"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19098","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19098","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2848","fieldValue":"Lin, Chin-Yew"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2848","fieldValue":" We present C*ST*RD, a cross-language information delivery system that supports cross-language information retrieval, information space visualization and navigation, machine translation, and text summarization of single documents and clusters of documents. C*ST*RD was assembled and trained within 1 month, in the context of DARPA's Surprise Language Exercise, that selected as source a heretofore unstudied language, Hindi. Given the brief time, we could not create deep Hindi capabilities for all the modules, but instead experimented with combining shallow Hindi capabilities, or even English-only modules, into one integrated system. Various possible configurations, with different tradeoffs in processing speed and ease of use, enable the rapid deployment of C*ST*RD to new languages under various conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2848","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2848","fieldValue":"ACM"}
