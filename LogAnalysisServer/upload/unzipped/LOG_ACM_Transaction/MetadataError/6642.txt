When both noncompliance and missing data are present, previous papers proposed moment and maximum likelihood estimators for binary and normally distributed continuous outcomes under the latent ignorable missing data mechanism. However, the latent ignorable missing data mechanism may be violated in practice, because the missing data mechanism may depend directly on the missing outcome itself. Under noncompliance and an outcome-dependent nonignorable missing data mechanism, previous studies showed the identifiability of complier average causal effect for discrete outcomes. In this article, we study the semiparametric identifiability and estimation of complier average causal effect in randomized clinical trials with both all-or-none noncompliance and outcome-dependent nonignorable missing continuous outcomes, and propose a two-step maximum likelihood estimator in order to eliminate the infinite dimensional nuisance parameter. Our method does not need to specify a parametric form for the missing data mechanism. We also evaluate the finite sample property of our method via extensive simulation studies and sensitivity analysis, with an application to a double-blinded psychiatric clinical trial."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7684","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7684","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7685","fieldValue":" Direct effect of a treatment variable on an endpoint variable and indirect effect through a mediate variable are important concepts for understanding a causal mechanism. However, the randomized assignment of treatment is not sufficient for identifying the direct and indirect effects, and extra assumptions and conditions are required, such as the sequential ignorability assumption without unobserved confounders or the sequential potential ignorability assumption. But these assumptions may not be credible in many applications. In this article, we consider the bounds on controlled direct effect, natural direct effect, and natural indirect effect without these extra assumptions. Cai et al. [2008] presented the bounds for the case of a binary endpoint, and we extend their results to the general case for an arbitrary endpoint."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7685","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7685","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7686","fieldValue":" In this article, we deal with the causal discovery problem on discrete data. First, we present a causal discovery method for traditional additive noise models that identifies the causal direction by analyzing the supports of the conditional distributions. Then, we present a causal mixture model to address the problem that the function transforming cause to effect varies across the observations. We propose a novel method called Support Analysis (SA) for causal discovery with the mixture model. Experiments using synthetic and real data are presented to demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm."}
