The best known algorithm for solving this problem runs in O(mn^3) time for simple pseudoknot or O(mn^4) time for embedded simple pseudoknot with space complexity of O(mn^3) for both structures, which require too much memory making it infeasible for comparing noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) with length several hundreds or more. We propose memory efficient algorithms to solve the same problem. We reduce the space complexity to O(n^3) for simple pseudoknot and O(mn^2 + n^3) for embedded simple pseudoknot while maintaining the same time complexity. We also show how to modify our algorithm to handle a restricted class of recursive simple pseudoknot which is found abundant in real data with space complexity of O(mn^2 + n^3) and time complexity of O(mn^4). Experimental results show that our algorithms are feasible for comparing ncRNAs of length more than 500."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4704","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4704","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4704","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4705","fieldValue":" Solid tumors must recruit new blood vessels for growth and maintenance. Discovering drugs that block tumor-induced development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is an important approach in cancer treatment. The complexity of angiogenesis presents both challenges and opportunities for cancer therapies. Intuitive approaches, such as blocking VegF activity, have yielded important therapies. But there maybe opportunities to alter nonintuitive targets either alone or in combination. This paper describes the development of a high-fidelity simulation of angiogenesis and uses this as the basis for a parallel search-based approach for the discovery of novel potential cancer treatments that inhibit blood vessel growth. Discovering new therapies is viewed as a multiobjective combinatorial optimization over two competing objectives: minimizing the estimated cost of practically developing the intervention while minimizing the simulated oxygen provided to the tumor by angiogenesis. Results show the effectiveness of the search process by finding interventions that are currently in use, and more interestingly, discovering potential new approaches that are nonintuitive yet effective."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4705","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
