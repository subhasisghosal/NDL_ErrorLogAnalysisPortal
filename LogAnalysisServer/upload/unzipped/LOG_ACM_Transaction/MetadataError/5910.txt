However, the dominance of visual design on the Web leaves visually disabled people at a disadvantage. Although assistive technologies, such as screen readers, usually provide basic access to information, the richness of the Web experience is still often lost. In particular, traversing the Web becomes a complicated task since the richness of visual objects presented to their sighted counterparts are neither appropriate nor accessible to visually disabled users. To address this problem, we have proposed an approach called Dante in which Web pages are annotated with semantic information to make their traversal properties explicit. Dante supports usage of different annotation techniques and as a proof-of-concept in this article, pages are annotated manually which when transcoded become rich. We first introduce Dante and then present a user evaluation which compares how visually disabled users perform certain travel-related tasks on original and transcoded versions of Web pages. We discuss the evaluation methodology in detail and present our findings, which provide useful insights into the transcoding process. Our evaluation shows that, in tests with users, document objects transcoded with Dante have a tendency to be much easier for visually disabled users to interact with when traversing Web pages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5694","fieldValue":"Glauert, J.

The eSign project was undertaken as a response to the need for technologies enabling efficient production and distribution over the Internet of sign language content. By using an avatar-independent scripting notation for signing gestures and a client-side web browser plug-in to translate this notation into motion data for an avatar, we achieve highly efficient delivery of signing, while avoiding the inflexibility of video or motion capture. Tests with members of the deaf community have indicated that the method can provide an acceptable quality of signing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1477","fieldValue":" The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Article 24 states that â\u20ACœStates Parties shall ensure inclusive education at all levels of education and life long learning.â\u20AC? This article focuses on the inclusion of people with visual impairments in learning processes including complex table-based data. Gaining insight into and understanding of complex data is a highly demanding task for people with visual impairments. Especially in the case of table-based data, the classic approaches of braille-based output devices and printing concepts are limited. Haptic perception requires sequential information processing rather than the parallel processing used by the visual system, which hinders haptic perception to gather a fast overview of and deeper insight into the data. Nevertheless, neuroscientific research has identified great dependencies between haptic perception and the cognitive processing of visual sensing. Based on these findings, we developed a haptic 3D surface representation of classic diagrams and charts, such as bar graphs and pie charts. In a qualitative evaluation study, we identified certain advantages of our relief-type 3D chart approach. Finally, we present an education model for German schools that includes a 3D printing approach to help integrate students with visual impairments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1477","fieldValue":"ACM"}
