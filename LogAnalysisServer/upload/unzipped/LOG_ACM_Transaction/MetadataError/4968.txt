However, some users, especially new users, often find it difficult to understand trending topics in Twitter when confronting the overwhelming and unorganized tweets. Existing work has attempted to provide a short snippet to explain a topic, but this only provides limited benefits and cannot satisfy the users' expectations. In this paper, we propose a new summarization task, namely sequential summarization, which aims to provide a serial of chronologically ordered short sub-summaries for a trending topic in order to provide a complete story about the development of the topic while retaining the order of information presentation. Different from the traditional summarization task, the numbers of sub-summaries for different topics are not fixed. Two approaches, i.e., stream-based and semantic-based approaches, are developed to detect the important subtopics within a trending topic. Then a short sub-summary is generated for each subtopic. In addition, we propose three new measures to evaluate the position-aware coverage, sequential novelty and sequence correlation of the system-generated summaries. The experimental results based on the proposed evaluation criteria have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3607","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3607","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3608","fieldValue":"van Hengel, P.

These methods are designed based on a resemblance with the auditory processing of sound in the mammalian inner ear, or on mathematical principles related to, for example, Fourier analysis. This study provides a comparison between several of these methods. Two tests were devised for this comparison: one based on susceptibility to noise and one on the expression of spectro-temporal detail. These two aspects were considered of importance for real world applications. While some methods produced good results on one of the two tests, others produced good results on both. Overall the transmission line model using an impedance function suggested by Zweig (â\u20ACœFinding the impedance of the organ of Corti,â\u20AC? J. Acoust. Soc. Amer., vol. 89, no. 3, pp. 1229-1254, 1991) provided the best results, though not significantly. Also a larger computational load may hinder application in some domains. The gammatone filterbank and straightforward spectrogram provide good alternatives with less computational load. The introduction of nonlinearity was shown to deteriorate performance on both tests, in both the filterbank and in the transmission line model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3609","fieldValue":" In the last two decades, significant effort has been put into annotating linguistic resources in several languages. Despite this valiant effort, there are still many languages left that have only small amounts of such resources. The goal of this article is to present and investigate a method of propagating information (specifically mentions) from a resource-rich language such as English into a relatively less-resource language such as Arabic. We compare also this approach to its equivalent counterpart using monolingual resources. Part of the investigation is to quantify the contribution of propagating information in different conditions - based on the availability of resources in the target language. Experiments on the language pair Arabic-English show that one can achieve relatively decent performance by propagating information from a language with richer resources such as English into Arabic alone (no resources or models in the source language Arabic). Furthermore, results show that propagated features from English do help improve the Arabic system performance even when used in conjunction with all feature types built from the source language. Experiments also show that using propagated features in conjunction with lexically-derived features only (as can be obtained directly from a mention annotated corpus) brings the system performance at the one obtained in the target language by using feature derived from many linguistic resources, therefore improving the system when such resources are not available."}
