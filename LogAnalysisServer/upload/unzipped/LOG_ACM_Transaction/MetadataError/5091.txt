{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3888","fieldValue":" This work extends and evaluates a two-dimensional automatic evaluation metric for machine translation, which is designed to operate at the sentence level. The metric is based on the concepts of adequacy and fluency, aiming at decoupling both semantic and syntactic components of the translation process to provide a more balanced view on translation quality. These two elements are independently evaluated by using continuous space and n-gram language modeling frameworks, respectively. Two different implementations are evaluated: a monolingual version that fully operates on the target language side, and a cross-language version that has the main advantage of not requiring reference translations. Both implementations are evaluated by comparing their performance with state-of-the-art automatic metrics over a dataset involving five different European languages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3889","fieldValue":" Coherence that ties sentences of a text into a meaningfully connected structure is of great importance to text generation and translation. In this paper, we propose topic-based coherence models to produce coherence for document translation, in terms of the continuity of sentence topics in a text. We automatically extract a coherence chain for each source text to be translated. Based on the extracted source coherence chain, we adopt a maximum entropy classifier to predict the target coherence chain that defines a linear topic structure for the target document. We build two topic-based coherence models on the predicted target coherence chain: 1) a word level coherence model that helps the decoder select coherent word translations and 2) a phrase level coherence model that guides the decoder to select coherent phrase translations. We integrate the two models into a state-of-the-art phrase-based machine translation system. Experiments on large-scale training data show that our coherence models achieve substantial improvements over both the baseline and models that are built on either document topics or sentence topics obtained under the assumption of direct topic correspondence between the source and target side. Additionally, further evaluations on translation outputs suggest that target translations generated by our coherence models are more coherent and similar to reference translations than those generated by the baseline."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3889","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3889","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3890","fieldValue":" This paper describes a new exponential language model that decomposes the model parameters into one or more low-rank matrices that learn regularities in the training data and one or more sparse matrices that learn exceptions (e.g., keywords). The low-rank matrices induce continuous-space representations of words and histories. The sparse matrices learn multiword lexical items and topic\/domain idiosyncrasies. This model generalizes the standard l1-regularized exponential language model, and has an efficient accelerated first-order training algorithm. Language modeling experiments show that the approach is useful in scenarios with limited training data, including low resource languages and domain adaptation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3890","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3890","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3891","fieldValue":"Rashwan, Mohsen A A"}
