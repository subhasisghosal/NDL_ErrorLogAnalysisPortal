Many of the proposed systems were designed with the assumption that all of the nodes are altruistic. However, this assumption may be violated by compromised nodes acting maliciously to degrade the accuracy of the coordinate system. As numerous peer-to-peer applications come to rely on virtual coordinate systems to achieve good performance, it is critical to address the security of such systems. In this work, we demonstrate the vulnerability of decentralized virtual coordinate systems to insider (or Byzantine) attacks. We propose techniques to make the coordinate assignment robust to malicious attackers without increasing the communication cost. We use both spatial and temporal correlations to perform context-sensitive outlier analysis to reject malicious updates and prevent unnecessary and erroneous adaptations. We demonstrate the attacks and mitigation techniques in the context of a well-known virtual coordinate system using simulations based on three representative, real-life Internet topologies of hosts and corresponding Round Trip Times (RTT). We show the effects of the attacks and the utility of the mitigation techniques on the virtual coordinate system as seen by higher-level applications, elucidating the utility of deploying robust virtual coordinate systems as network services."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22314","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22314","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22315","fieldValue":"Tsang, Patrick P"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22315","fieldValue":"Smith, Sean W"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22315","fieldValue":" Several credential systems have been proposed in which users can authenticate to service providers anonymously. Since anonymity can give users the license to misbehave, some variants allow the selective deanonymization (or linking) of misbehaving users upon a complaint to a Trusted Third Party (TTP). The ability of the TTP to revoke a userâ\u20AC™s privacy at any time, however, is too strong a punishment for misbehavior. To limit the scope of deanonymization, some systems have been proposed in which users can be deanonymized only if they authenticate â\u20ACœtoo many times,â\u20AC? such as â\u20ACœdouble spendingâ\u20AC? with electronic cash. While useful in some applications, such techniques cannot be generalized to more subjective definitions of misbehavior, for example, using such schemes it is not possible to block anonymous users who â\u20ACœdeface too many Web pagesâ\u20AC? on a Web site. We present BLAC, the first anonymous credential system in which service providers can revoke the credentials of misbehaving users without relying on a TTP . Since revoked users remain anonymous, misbehaviors can be judged subjectively without users fearing arbitrary deanonymization by a TTP . Additionally, our construction supports a d-strikes-out revocation policy, whereby users who have been subjectively judged to have repeatedly misbehaved at least d times are revoked from the system. Thus, for the first time, it is indeed possible to block anonymous users who have â\u20ACœdefaced too many Web pagesâ\u20AC? using our scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22315","fieldValue":"ACM"}
