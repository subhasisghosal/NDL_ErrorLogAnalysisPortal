We present a new method for surface reconstruction by integrating a set of registered depth maps with dramatically varying sampling rate. The method is based on the construction of a hierarchical signed distance field represented in an incomplete primal octree by incrementally adding triangulated depth maps. Due to the adaptive data structure, our algorithm is able to handle depth maps with varying scale and to consistently represent coarse, low-resolution regions as well as small details contained in high-resolution depth maps. A final surface mesh is extracted from the distance field by construction of a tetrahedral complex from the scattered signed distance values and applying the Marching Tetra-hedra algorithm on the partition. The output is an adaptive triangle mesh that seamlessly connects coarse and highly detailed regions while avoiding filling areas without suitable input data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16546","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16546","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16547","fieldValue":" We present a method to globally parameterize a surface represented by height maps over a set of planes (range images). In contrast to other parametrization techniques, we do not start with a manifold mesh. The parametrization we compute defines a manifold structure, it is seamless and globally smooth, can be aligned to geometric features and shows good quality in terms of angle and area preservation, comparable to current parametrization techniques for meshes. Computing such global seamless parametrization makes it possible to perform quad remeshing, texture mapping and texture synthesis and many other types of geometry processing operations. Our approach is based on a formulation of the Poisson equation on a manifold structure defined for the surface by the range images. Construction of such global parametrization requires only a way to project surface data onto a set of planes, and can be applied directly to implicit surfaces, nonmanifold surfaces, very large meshes, and collections of range scans. We demonstrate application of our technique to all these geometry types."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16548","fieldValue":"Tse, Yu-Chiu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16548","fieldValue":" We introduce a method for increasing the framerate of real-time rendering applications. Whereas many existing temporal upsampling strategies only reuse information from previous frames, our bidirectional technique reconstructs intermediate frames from a pair of consecutive rendered frames. This significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of data reuse since very few pixels are simultaneously occluded in both frames. We present two versions of this basic algorithm. The first is appropriate for fill-bound scenes as it limits the number of expensive shading calculations, but involves rasterization of scene geometry at each intermediate frame. The second version, our more significant contribution, reduces both shading and geometry computations by performing reprojection using only image-based buffers. It warps and combines the adjacent rendered frames using an efficient iterative search on their stored scene depth and flow. Bidirectional reprojection introduces a small amount of lag. We perform a user study to investigate this lag, and find that its effect is minor. We demonstrate substantial performance improvements (3--4x) for a variety of applications, including vertex-bound and fill-bound scenes, multi-pass effects, and motion blur."}
