{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16764","fieldValue":" Existing video object cutout systems can only deal with limited cases. They usually require detailed user interactions to segment real-life videos, which often suffer from both inseparable statistics (similar appearance between foreground and background) and temporal discontinuities (e.g. large movements, newly-exposed regions following disocclusion or topology change). In this paper, we present an efficient video cutout system to meet this challenge. A novel directional classifier is proposed to handle temporal discontinuities robustly, and then multiple classifiers are incorporated to cover a variety of cases. The outputs of these classifiers are integrated via another classifier, which is learnt from real examples. The foreground matte is solved by a coherent matting procedure, and remaining errors can be removed easily by additive spatio-temporal local editing. Experiments demonstrate that our system performs more robustly and more intelligently than existing systems in dealing with various input types, thus saving a lot of user labor and time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16765","fieldValue":" We present a method for consistent automatic transfer of edits applied to one image to many other images of the same object or scene. By introducing novel, content-adaptive weight functions we enhance the non-rigid alignment framework of Lucas-Kanade to robustly handle changes of view point, illumination and non-rigid deformations of the subjects. Our weight functions are content-aware and possess high-order smoothness, enabling to define high-quality image warping with a low number of parameters using spatially-varying weighted combinations of affine deformations. Optimizing the warp parameters leads to subpixel-accurate alignment while maintaining computation efficiency. Our method allows users to perform precise, localized edits such as simultaneous painting on multiple images in real-time, relieving them from tedious and repetitive manual reapplication to each individual image."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16765","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16765","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16766","fieldValue":" Decomposing a volume into high-quality hexahedral cells is a challenging task in geometric modeling and computational geometry. Inspired by the use of cross field in quad meshing and the CubeCover approach in hex meshing, we present a complete all-hex meshing framework based on singularity-restricted field that is essential to induce a valid all-hex structure. Given a volume represented by a tetrahedral mesh, we first compute a boundary-aligned 3D frame field inside it, then convert the frame field to be singularity-restricted by our effective topological operations. In our all-hex meshing framework, we apply the CubeCover method to achieve the volume parametrization. For reducing degenerate elements appearing in the volume parametrization, we also propose novel tetrahedral split operations to preprocess singularity-restricted frame fields. Experimental results show that our algorithm generates high-quality all-hex meshes from a variety of 3D volumes robustly and efficiently."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16767","fieldValue":" We propose a novel, design-driven, approach to quadrangulation of closed 3D curves created by sketch-based or other curve modeling systems. Unlike the multitude of approaches for quad-remeshing of existing surfaces, we rely solely on the input curves to both conceive and construct the quad-mesh of an artist imagined surface bounded by them. We observe that viewers complete the intended shape by envisioning a dense network of smooth, gradually changing, flow-lines that interpolates the input curves. Components of the network bridge pairs of input curve segments with similar orientation and shape. Our algorithm mimics this behavior. It first segments the input closed curves into pairs of matching segments, defining dominant flow line sequences across the surface. It then interpolates the input curves by a network of quadrilateral cycles whose iso-lines define the desired flow line network. We proceed to interpolate these networks with all-quad meshes that convey designer intent. We evaluate our results by showing convincing quadrangulations of complex and diverse curve networks with concave, non-planar cycles, and validate our approach by comparing our results to artist generated interpolating meshes."}
