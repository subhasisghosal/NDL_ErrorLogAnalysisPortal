While much progress has been made to find practical algorithms for reconstructing a phylogenetic network from a set of sequences, all attempts to endorse a class of phylogenetic networks (strictly extending the class of phylogenetic trees) with a well-founded distance measure have, to the best of our knowledge and with the only exception of the bipartition distance on regular networks, failed so far. In this paper, we present and study a new meaningful class of phylogenetic networks, called tree-child phylogenetic networks, and we provide an injective representation of these networks as multisets of vectors of natural numbers, their path multiplicity vectors. We then use this representation to define a distance on this class that extends the well-known Robinson-Foulds distance for phylogenetic trees and to give an alignment method for pairs of networks in this class. Simple polynomial algorithms for reconstructing a tree-child phylogenetic network from its path multiplicity vectors, for computing the distance between two tree-child phylogenetic networks and for aligning a pair of tree-child phylogenetic networks, are provided. They have been implemented as a Perl package and a Java applet, which can be found at http:\/\/bioinfo.uib.es\/~recerca\/phylonetworks\/mudistance\/."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4446","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4446","fieldValue":"Phylogenetic network, tree-child phylogenetic network, phylogenetic tree, partition distance, network alignment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4446","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4446","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1342","fieldValue":" Dynamic forms of resource pricing have recently been introduced by cloud providers that offer Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) capabilities in order to maximize profits and balance resource supply and demand. The design of a mechanism that efficiently prices perishable cloud resources in line with a providerâ\u20AC™s profit maximization goal remains an open research challenge, however. In this article, we propose the Online Extended Consensus Revenue Estimate mechanism in the setting of a recurrent, multiunit and single price auction for IaaS cloud resources. The mechanism is envy-free, has a high probability of being truthful, and generates a near optimal profit for the provider. We combine the proposed auction design with a scheme for dynamically calculating reserve prices based on data center Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and electricity costs. Our simulation-based evaluation of the mechanism demonstrates its effectiveness under a broad variety of market conditions. In particular, we show how it improves on the classical uniform price auction, and we investigate the value of prior knowledge on the execution time of virtual machines for maximizing profit. We also developed a system prototype and conducted a small-scale experimental study with a group of 10 users that confirms the truthfulness property of the mechanism in a real test environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1342","fieldValue":"PUE"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1342","fieldValue":"ACM"}
