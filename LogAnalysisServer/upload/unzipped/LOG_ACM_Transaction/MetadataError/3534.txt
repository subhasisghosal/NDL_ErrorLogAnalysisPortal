Such correct behavior is typically expressed by global invariants over the state of different sensors or actuators. Nevertheless, to leverage the computing capabilities of WSN nodes, the application intelligence needs to reside inside the network. The task of ensuring that the monitored processes behave safely thus becomes inherently distributed, and hence more complex. In this article we present DICE, a system enabling WSN-based distributed monitoring of global invariants. A DICE invariant is expressed by predicates defined over the state of multiple WSN nodes, such as the expected state of actuators based on given sensed environmental conditions. Our modular design allows two alternative protocols for detecting invariant violations: both perform in-network aggregation but with different degrees of decentralization, therefore supporting scenarios with different network and data dynamics. We characterize and compare the two protocols using large-scale simulations and a real-world testbed. Our results indicate that invariant violations are detected in a timely and energy-efficient manner. For instance, in a 225-node 15-hop network, invariant violations are detected in less than a second and with only a few packets sent by each node."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21504","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21504","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21505","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of detecting the formation of a set of wireless sensor nodes based on the pairwise measurements of signal strength corresponding to all transmitter\/receiver pairs. We assume that formations take values in a discrete set and develop a composite hypothesis testing approach which uses a Generalized Likelihood Test (GLT) as the decision rule. The GLT distinguishes between a set of probability density function (pdf) families constructed using a custom pdf interpolation technique. The GLT is compared with the simple Likelihood Test (LT). We also adapt one prevalent supervised learning approach, Multiple Support Vector Machines (MSVMs), and compare it with our probabilistic methods. Due to the highly variant measurements from the wireless sensor nodes, and these methods' different adaptability to multiple observations, our analysis and experimental results suggest that GLT is more accurate and suitable for formation detection. The formation detection problem has interesting applications in posture detection with Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), which is extremely useful in health monitoring and rehabilitation. Another valuable application we explore concerns autonomous robot systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21506","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of maximizing the lifetime of a query-based wireless sensor network in which all of the sensor nodes are both producers and consumers of network resources. Of particular concern is the problem of selecting a common transmission range for all of the sensor nodes, the resource replication level (or time-to-live counter), and the active\/sleep schedule of nodes while satisfying connectivity and quality-of-service constraints. To this end, we first formulate a general, mixed-integer programming model that selects the optimal operating parameters in each period of a finite planning horizon. Subsequently, we examine in detail specific connectivity and quality-of-service constraints that can be considered within this framework. Due to the complexity of the model, we formulate an alternative linearized version that can be solved more efficiently. Additionally, we devise a simple algorithm to solve a special case of the problem when alive nodes are always active. Computational results indicate that the maximum attainable lifetime can be significantly improved by adjusting the key operating parameters as sensor nodes fail over time due to energy depletion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21506","fieldValue":"ACM"}
