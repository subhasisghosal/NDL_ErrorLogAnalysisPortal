Unlike the traditional FiDi game, where image pairs (source image and target image) with five different patches are manually produced by professional game developers, the proposed Personalized FiDi (P-FiDi) electronic game can be played in a fully automatic Snap & Play mode. Snap means that players first take photos with their digital cameras. The newly captured photos are used as source images and fed into the P-FiDi system to autogenerate the counterpart target images for users to play. Four steps are adopted to autogenerate target images: enhancing the visual quality of source images, extracting some changeable patches from the source image, selecting the most suitable combination of changeable patches and difference styles for the image, and generating the differences on the target image with state-of-the-art image processing techniques. In addition, the P-FiDi game can be easily redesigned for the im-game advertising. Extensive experiments show that the P-FiDi electronic game is satisfying in terms of player experience, seamless advertisement, and technical feasibility."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7580","fieldValue":" This article deals with a decision-making problem concerning an agent who wants to choose a partner from multiple candidates for long-term collaboration. To choose the best partner, the agent can rely on prior information he knows about the candidates. However, to improve his decision, he can request additional information from information sources. Nonetheless, acquiring information from external information sources about candidates may be biased due to different personalities of the agent searching for a partner and the information source. In addition, information may be costly. Considering the bias and the cost of the information sources, the optimization problem addressed in this article is threefold: (1) determining the necessary amount of additional information, (2) selecting information sources from which to request the information, and (3) choosing the candidates on whom to request the additional information. We propose a heuristic to solve this optimization problem. The results of experiments on simulated and real-world domains demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7580","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7580","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7581","fieldValue":"U, Leong Hou"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7581","fieldValue":" Deducing trip-related information from web-scale datasets has received large amounts of attention recently. Identifying points of interest (POIs) in geo-tagged photos is one of these problems. The problem can be viewed as a standard clustering problem of partitioning two-dimensional objects. In this work, we study spectral clustering, which is the first attempt for the identification of POIs. However, there is no unified approach to assigning the subjective clustering parameters, and these parameters vary immensely in different metropolitans and locations. To address this issue, we study a self-tuning technique that can properly determine the parameters for the clustering needed. Besides geographical information, web photos inherently store other rich information. Such heterogenous information can be used to enhance the identification accuracy. Thereby, we study a novel refinement framework that is based on the tightness and cohesion degree of the additional information. We thoroughly demonstrate our findings by web-scale datasets collected from Flickr."}
