Producing realistic-looking facial animations that are able to transmit this degree of complexity continues to be a challenging research topic in computer graphics. One important question that remains to be answered is: When are facial animations good enough&quest; Here we present an integrated framework in which psychophysical experiments are used in a first step to systematically evaluate the perceptual quality of several different computer-generated animations with respect to real-world video sequences. The first experiment provides an evaluation of several animation techniques, exposing specific animation parameters that are important to achieve perceptual fidelity. In a second experiment, we then use these benchmarked animation techniques in the context of perceptual research in order to systematically investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of expressions. A third and final experiment uses the quality measures that were developed in the first two experiments to examine the perceptual impact of changing facial features to improve the animation techniques. Using such an integrated approach, we are able to provide important insights into facial expressions for both the perceptual and computer graphics community."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3312","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3312","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23811","fieldValue":" The signature block is a common structured component found in email messages. Accurate identification and analysis of signature blocks is important in many multimedia messaging and information retrieval applications such as email text-to-speech rendering, automatic construction of personal address databases, and interactive message retrieval. It is also a very challenging task, because signature blocks often appear in complex two-dimensional layouts which are guided only by loose conventions. Traditional text analysis methods designed to deal with sequential text cannot handle two-dimensional structures, while the highly unconstrained nature of signature blocks makes the application of two-dimensional grammars very difficult. In this article, we describe an algorithm for signature block analysis which combines two-dimensional structural segmentation with one-dimensional grammatical constraints. The information obtained from both layout and linguistic analysis is integrated in the form of weighted finite-state transducers. The algorithm is currently implemented as a component in a preprocessing system for email text-to-speech rendering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23811","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23811","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23812","fieldValue":" The inference network model of information retrieval allows a probabilistic interpretation of query operators. In particular, Boolean query operators are conveniently modeled as link matrices of the Bayesian Network. Prior work has shown, however, that these operators do not perform as well as the pnorm operators used for modeling query operators in the context of the vector space model. This motivates the search for alternative probabilistic formulations for these operators. The design of such alternatives must contend with the issue of computational tractability, since the evaluation of an arbitrary operator requires exponential time. We define a flexible class of link matrices that are natural candidates for the implementation of query operators and an O(n2) algorithm (n = the number of parent nodes) for the computation of probabilities involving link matrices of this class. We present experimental results indicating that Boolean operators implemented in terms of link matrices from this class perform as well as pnorm operators in the context of the INQUERY inference network."}
