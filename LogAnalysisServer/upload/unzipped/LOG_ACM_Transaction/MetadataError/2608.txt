One of the existing difficulties in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) and Web search is the lack of appropriate translations of new terminology and proper names. The proposed approach successfully exploits the anchor-text resources and reduces the existing difficulties of query term translation. Many query terms that cannot be obtained in general-purpose translation dictionaries are, therefore, extracted."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18774","fieldValue":" A number of algorithms involving Markov chains contain no subtractions. This property makes the analysis of rounding errors particularly simple. To show this, some principles for analyzing the propagation and generation of rounding errors in algorithms containing no subtraction are discussed first. These principles are then applied in the context of a simple recursive algorithm involving the transient solution of discrete-time Markov chains, Jensen's algorithm, and state reduction. Jensen's algorithm, also known as randomization or uniformization, is an algorithm for finding transient solutions of continuous-time Markov chains. State reduction is a method for finding equilibrium probabilities for discrete-time or continuous-time Markov chains."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18774","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18774","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/18775","fieldValue":"Du, D-Z"}
