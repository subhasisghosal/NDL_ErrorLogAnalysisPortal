We learn a model of body shape deformations due to breathing for different breathing types and provide simple animation controls to render lifelike breathing regardless of body shape. We capture and align high-resolution 3D scans of 58 human subjects. We compute deviations from each subject's mean shape during breathing, and study the statistics of such shape changes for different genders, body shapes, and breathing types. We use the volume of the registered scans as a proxy for lung volume and learn a novel non-linear model relating volume and breathing type to 3D shape deformations and pose changes. We then augment a SCAPE body model so that body shape is determined by identity, pose, and the parameters of the breathing model. These parameters provide an intuitive interface with which animators can synthesize 3D human avatars with realistic breathing motions. We also develop a novel interface for animating breathing using a spirometer, which measures the changes in breathing volume of a \"breath actor\"."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2613","fieldValue":" We show that for every positive &epsiv; > 0, unless NP âŠ\u201A BPQP, it is impossible to approximate the maximum quadratic assignment problem within a factor better than $2log^1-&epsiv; n$ by a reduction from the maximum label cover problem.

Unlike all previous methods, our algorithm achieves real-time performance for rasterization and texture-mapping DCIs of up to millions of curves. After precomputation, computing the color at a single pixel takes nearly constant time. We also incorporate Gaussian radial basis functions into our fast multipole representation using the fast Gauss transform. The fast multipole representation is not only a data structure for fast color evaluation, but also a framework for vector graphics analogues of bitmap editing operations. We exhibit this capability by devising new tools for fast diffusion curve Poisson cloning and composition with masks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17046","fieldValue":"ACM"}
