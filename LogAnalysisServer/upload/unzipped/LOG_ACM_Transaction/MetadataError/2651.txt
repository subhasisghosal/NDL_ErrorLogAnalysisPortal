However, the most widely used multiplicative, congruential random-number generators with modulus 231 âˆ\u2019 1 have a cycle length of about 2.1 Ã\u2014 109. Moreover, developing portable and efficient generators with a larger modulus such as 261 âˆ\u2019 1 is more difficult than those with modulus 231 âˆ\u2019 1. This article presents the development of multiplicative, congruential generators with modulus m = 2p âˆ\u2019 1 and four forms of multipliers: 2k1 &minus 2k2, 2k1 + 2k2, m âˆ\u2019 2k1 + 2k2, and m âˆ\u2019 2k1 âˆ\u2019 2k2, k1 > k2. The multipliers for modulus 231 âˆ\u2019 1 and 261 âˆ\u2019 1 are measured by spectral tests, and the best ones are presented. The generators with these multipliers are portable and vary fast. They have also passed several empirical tests, including the frequency test, the run test, and the maximum-of-t test."}
