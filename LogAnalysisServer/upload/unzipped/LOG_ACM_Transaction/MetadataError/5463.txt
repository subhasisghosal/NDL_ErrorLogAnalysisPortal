In this contribution, we present a methodology based on Artificial Neural Networks for protein functional classification. A new protein coding scheme, called here Extended-Sequence Coding by Sliding Windows, is presented with the goal of overcoming some of the difficulties of the well method Sequence Coding by Sliding Window. The new protein coding scheme uses more than one sliding window length with a weight factor that is proportional to the window length, avoiding the ambiguity problem without ignoring the identity of small subsequences Accuracy for Sequence Coding by Sliding Windows ranged from 60.1 to 77.7 percent for the first bacterium protein set and from 61.9 to 76.7 percent for the second one, whereas the accuracy for the proposed Extended-Sequence Coding by Sliding Windows scheme ranged from 70.7 to 97.1 percent for the first bacterium protein set and from 61.1 to 93.3 percent for the second one. Additionally, protein sequences classified inconsistently by the Artificial Neural Networks were analyzed by CD-Search revealing that there are some disagreement in public repositories, calling the attention for the relevant issue of error propagation in annotated databases due the incorrect transferred annotations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4690","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4690","fieldValue":"Artificial neural network, protein functional classification, protein coding, protein functional classification error."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4135","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4691","fieldValue":"DeBlasio, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4691","fieldValue":" >Structure-based RNA multiple alignment is particularly challenging because covarying mutations make sequence information alone insufficient. Existing tools for RNA multiple alignment first generate pairwise RNA structure alignments and then build the multiple alignment using only sequence information. Here we present PMFastR, an algorithm which iteratively uses a sequence-structure alignment procedure to build a structure-based RNA multiple alignment from one sequence with known structure and a database of sequences from the same family. PMFastR also has low memory consumption allowing for the alignment of large sequences such as 16S and 23S rRNA. The algorithm also provides a method to utilize a multicore environment. We present results on benchmark data sets from BRAliBase, which shows PMFastR performs comparably to other state-of-the-art programs. Finally, we regenerate 607 Rfam seed alignments and show that our automated process creates multiple alignments similar to the manually curated Rfam seed alignments. Thus, the techniques presented in this paper allow for the generation of multiple alignments using sequence-structure guidance, while limiting memory consumption. As a result, multiple alignments of long RNA sequences, such as 16S and 23S rRNAs, can easily be generated locally on a personal computer.
