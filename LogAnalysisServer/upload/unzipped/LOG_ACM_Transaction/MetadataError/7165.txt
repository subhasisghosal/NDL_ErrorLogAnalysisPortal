In order to scale for large networks containing hundreds and thousands of subnets, OSPF supports a two-level hierarchical routing scheme through the use of OSPF areas. Subnet addresses within an area are aggregated, and this aggregation is a crucial requirement for scaling OSPF to large AS domains, as it results in significant reductions in routing table sizes, smaller link-state databases, and less network traffic to synchronize the router link-state databases. On the other hand, address aggregation also implies loss of information about the length of the shortest path to each subnet, which in turn, can lead to suboptimal routing.In this paper, we address the important practical problem of configuring OSPF aggregates to minimize the error in OSPF shortest-path computations due to subnet aggregation. We first develop an optimal dynamic programming algorithm that, given an upper bound k on the number of aggregates to be advertised and a weight assignment function for the aggregates, computes the k aggregates that result in the minimum cumulative error in the shortest-path computations for all source-destination subnet pairs. Subsequently, we tackle the problem of assigning weights to OSPF aggregates such that the cumulative error in the computed shortest paths is minimized. We demonstrate that, while for certain special cases (e.g., unweighted cumulative error) efficient optimal algorithms for the weight assignment problem can be devised, the general problem itself is NP-hard. Consequently, we have to rely on search heuristics to solve the weight assignment problem. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to address the algorithmic issues underlying the configuration of OSPF aggregates and to propose efficient configuration algorithms that are provably optimal for many practical scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9150","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9150","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9150","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9151","fieldValue":"Sundaram-Stukel, David J."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9151","fieldValue":" Previous scalable on-demand streaming protocols do not allow clients to recover from packet loss. This paper develops new protocols that: 1) have a tunably short latency for the client to begin playing the media; 2) allow heterogeneous clients to recover lost packets without jitter as long as each client's cumulative loss rate is within a tunable threshold; and 3) assume a tunable upper bound on the transmission rate to each client that can be as small as a fraction (e.g., 25%) greater than the media play rate. Models are developed to compute the minimum required server bandwidth for a given loss rate and playback latency. The results of the models are used to develop the new protocols and assess their performance. The new protocols, Reliable Periodic Broadcast and Reliable Bandwidth Skimming, are simple to implement and achieve nearly the best possible scalability and efficiency for a given set of client characteristics and desirable\/feasible media quality. Furthermore, the results show that the new reliable protocols that transmit to each client at only twice the media play rate have similar performance to previous protocols that require clients to receive at many times the play rate."}
