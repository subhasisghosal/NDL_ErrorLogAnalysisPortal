We present data structures and methods that are common for many (discontinuous) FEMs and show how we have implemented the components as an object-oriented framework. This framework facilitates and accelerates the implementation of finite element programs, the assessment of algorithms, and their application to real-world problems. The article documents the status of the framework, exemplifies aspects of its philosophy and design, and demonstrates the feasibility of the approach with several application examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19178","fieldValue":"PDE"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19178","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19178","fieldValue":"ACM"}
