{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1328","fieldValue":" For real-world distributed systems, the knowledge component at the core of the MAPE-K loop has to be inferred, as it cannot be realistically assumed to be defined a priori. Accordingly, this paper considers fault monitoring as a latent factors discovery problem. In the context of end-to-end probing, the goal is to devise an efficient sampling policy that makes the best use of a constrained sampling budget. Previous work addresses fault monitoring in a collaborative prediction framework, where the information is a snapshot of the probes outcomes. Here, we take into account the fact that the system dynamically evolves at various time scales. We propose and evaluate Sequential Matrix Factorization (SMF) that exploits both the recent advances in matrix factorization for the instantaneous information and a new sampling heuristics based on historical information. The effectiveness of the SMF approach is exemplified on datasets of increasing difficulty and compared with state of the art history-based or snapshot-based methods. In all cases, strong adaptivity under the specific flavor of active learning is required to unleash the full potential of coupling the most confident and the most uncertain sampling heuristics, which is the cornerstone of SMF."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/1328","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: National University of Defense Technology, Universit&#233; Paris Sud, INRIA and CNRS, Changsha, China (Feng, Dawei); Universit&#233; Paris Sud, INRIA and CNRS, Orsay Cedex (Germain, Cecile)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1328","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1328","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4287","fieldValue":" Solving a multiclass classification task using a small imbalanced database of patterns of high dimension is difficult due to the curse-of-dimensionality and the bias of the training toward the majority classes. Such a problem has arisen while diagnosing genetic abnormalities by classifying a small database of fluorescence in situ hybridization signals of types having different frequencies of occurrence. We propose and experimentally study using the cytogenetic domain two solutions to the problem. The first is hierarchical decomposition of the classification task, where each hierarchy level is designed to tackle a simpler problem which is represented by classes that are approximately balanced. The second solution is balancing the data by up-sampling the minority classes accompanied by dimensionality reduction. Implemented by the naive Bayesian classifier or the multilayer perceptron neural network, both solutions have diminished the problem and contributed to accuracy improvement. In addition, the experiments suggest that coping with the smallness of the data is more beneficial than dealing with its imbalance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4287","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4287","fieldValue":"Classification, dimensionality reduction, genetic diagnosis, imbalanced data, multilayer perceptron (MLP), naive Bayesian classifier (NBC), small sample size."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4288","fieldValue":" Biological data mining using kernel methods can be improved by a task-specific choice of the kernel function. Oligo kernels for genomic sequence analysis have proven to have a high discriminative power and to provide interpretable results. Oligo kernels that consider subsequences of different lengths can be combined and parameterized to increase their flexibility. For adapting these parameters efficiently, gradient-based optimization of the kernel-target alignment is proposed. The power of this new, general model selection procedure and the benefits of fitting kernels to problem classes are demonstrated by adapting oligo kernels for bacterial gene start detection."}
