Motifs are generally represented by matrices (PWM orPSSM) or strings. However, these representations cannot model biological binding sites wellbecause they fail to capture nucleotide interdependence. It has been pointed out by manyresearchers that the nucleotides of the DNA binding site cannot be treated independently, e.g. thebinding sites of zinc finger in proteins. In this paper, a new representation called Scored PositionSpecific Pattern (SPSP), which is a generalization of the matrix and string representations, isintroduced which takes into consideration the dependent occurrences of neighboring nucleotides.Even though the problem of discovering the optimal motif in SPSP representation is proved to beNP-hard, we introduce a heuristic algorithm called SPSP-Finder, which can effectively findoptimal motifs in most simulated cases and some real cases for which existing popular motiffindingsoftware, such as Weeder, MEME and AlignACE, fail."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4342","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4343","fieldValue":"Yin, Zong-Xian"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4343","fieldValue":"Chiang, Jung-Hsien"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4343","fieldValue":" When analyzing the results of microarray experiments, biologists generally use unsupervised categorization tools. However, such tools regard each time point as an independent dimension and utilize the Euclidean distance to compute the similarities between expressions. Furthermore, some of these methods require the number of clusters to be determined in advance, which is clearly impossible in the case of a new dataset. Therefore, this study proposes a novel scheme, designated as the Variation-based Co-expression Detection (VCD) algorithm, to analyze the trends of expressions based on their variation over time. The proposed algorithm has two advantages. First, it is unnecessary to determine the number of clusters in advance since the algorithm automatically detects those genes whose profiles are grouped together and creates patterns for these groups. Second, the algorithm features a new measurement criterion for calculating the degree of change of the expressions between adjacent time points and evaluating their trend similarities. Three real-world microarray datasets are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4343","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
