Many definitions for names, addresses, and routes have been proposed, but the exact relations among these concepts are obscure. A taxonomy of names, addresses, and routes is presented. First, we identify names and routes as the essential concepts of communication. Then, addresses are introduced as an intermediate form that eases the process of mapping between names and routes; an original definition of an address is thus proposed. Relations among names, addresses, and routes are explained with the concept of mapping. On this basis, a general model relating names, addresses, and routes is built and then applied recursively throughout a layered architecture, leading to a layered naming and addressing model which may play the same role for naming and addressing features that the OS1 reference model plays for the definition of services and protocols. Finally, the model is particularized to a typical network architecture. The model may also be applied to non-OSI layered systems; naming, addressing, and routing issues in any network architecture could be a particular instance of this layered model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23598","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23598","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23599","fieldValue":" Every information system incorporates a database component, and a frequent activity of users of information systems is to present it with queries. These queries reflect the presuppositions of their authors about the system and the information it contains. With most query processors, queries that are based on erroneous presuppositions often result in null answers. These fake nulls are misleading, since they do not point out the user's erroneous presuppositions (and can even be interpreted as their affirmation). This article describes the SEAVE mechanism for extracting presuppositions from queries and verifying their correctness. The verification is done against three repositories of information: the actual data, their integrity constraints, and their completeness assertions. Consequently, queries that reflect erroneous presuppositions are answered with informative messages instead of null answers, and user-system communication is thus improved (an aspect that is particularly important in systems that often are accessed by naive users). First, the principles of SEAVE are described abstractly. Then, specific algorithms for implementing it with relational databases are presented, including a new method for storing knowledge and an efficient algorithm for processing queries against the knowledge."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23599","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23599","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23600","fieldValue":" In order to apply office automation in a meaningful fashion, it is apparent that some understanding of the office is necessary. Most descriptive studies of the office have placed great emphasis on manifest office actions, suggesting that offices are the embodiment of these actions. The meanings of these actions or tasks, however, have been given scant attention. There exist a number of office activity or task taxonomies, but they do little more than provide a simple and limited structure through which to conceive of an office. From a social-analytic perspective this appears to be overly simplistic and misses the richness of social action in an office. Focusing on the overt and manifest aspects of the office may very well lead to its misrepresentation. This paper takes a critical look at the way offices are conceived in the office automation literature and suggests alternatives that may provide a better understanding of the real functions of an office."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23601","fieldValue":" MINOS is an object-oriented multimedia information system that provides integrated facilities for creating and managing complex multimedia objects. In this paper the model for multimedia documents supported by MINOS and its implementation is described. Described in particular are functions provided in MINOS that exploit the capabilities of a modern workstation equipped with image and voice input-output devices to accomplish an active multimedia document presentation and browsing within documents. These functions are powerful enough to support a variety of office applications. Also described are functions provided for the extraction of information from multimedia documents that exist in a large repository of information (multimedia document archiver) and functions that select and transform this information. Facilities for information sharing among objects of the archiver are described; an interactive multimedia editor that is used for the extraction and interactive creation of new information is outlined; finally, a multimedia document formatter that is used to synthesize a new multimedia document from extracted and interactively generated information is presented.This prototype system runs on a SUN-3 workstation running UNIX'\". An Instavox, directly addressable, analog device is used to store voice segments."}
