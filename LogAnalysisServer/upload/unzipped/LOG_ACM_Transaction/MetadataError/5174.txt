The traditional decision rule selects the candidate with the greatest potential from a candidate space by examining each candidate individually. However, viewing each candidate as independent imposes a serious limitation on the translation task. We instead view the problem from a ranking perspective that naturally allows the consideration of an entire list of candidates as a whole through the adoption of a listwise ranking function. Our shift from a pointwise to a list-wise perspective proves to be a simple yet powerful extension to current modeling that allows arbitrary pairwise functions to be incorporated as features, whose weights can be estimated jointly with traditional ones. We further demonstrate that our formulation encompasses the minimum Bayes risk (MBR) approach, another decision rule that considers restricted listwise information, as a special case. Experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline and MBR methods across the considered test sets."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4073","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4073","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4073","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4074","fieldValue":"Palazuelos-Cagigas, Sira E."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4074","fieldValue":"Bastos-Filho, Teodiano F."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4074","fieldValue":"Sarcinelli-Filho, Maacuterio"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4074","fieldValue":" This paper proposes an exponential interpolation to merge a part-of-speech-based language model and a word-based n-gram language model to accomplish word prediction tasks. In order to find a set of mathematical equations to properly describe the language modeling, a model based on partial differential equations is proposed. With the appropriate initial conditions, it was found an interpolation model similar to the traditional maximum entropy language model. Improvements in keystroke saved and perplexity over the word-based n-gram language model and two other traditional interpolation models is obtained, considering three different languages. The proposed interpolation model also provides additional improvement in hit rate parameter."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4074","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4074","fieldValue":"ACM"}
