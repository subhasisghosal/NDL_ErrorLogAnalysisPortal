This is achieved by constructing a weighted DAG whose vertices stand for exons, and whose arcs stand for split alignments of the RNA-Seq reads to the exons. The task consists of finding a number of paths, together with their expression levels, which optimally explain the weights of the graph under various fitting functions, such as least sum of squared residuals. In (Tomescu et al. BMC Bioinformatics, 2013) we studied this genome-guided multi-assembly problem when the number of allowed solution paths was linear in the number of arcs. In this paper, we further refine this problem by asking for a bounded number $k$ of solution paths, which is the setting of most practical interest. We formulate this problem in very broad terms, and show that for many choices of the fitting function it becomes NP-hard. Nevertheless, we identify a natural graph parameter of a DAG $G$ , which we call arc-width and denote $\\langle G\\rangle$ , and give a dynamic programming algorithm running in time $O(W^k\\langle G\\rangle ^k(\\langle G\\rangle + k)n)$ , where $n$ is the number of vertices and $W$ is the maximum weight of $G$ . This implies that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in the parameters $W$ , $\\langle G\\rangle$ , and $k$ . We also show that the arc-width of DAGs constructed from simulated and real RNA-Seq reads is small in practice. Finally, we study the approximability of this problem, and, in particular, give a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the case when the fitting function penalizes the maximum ratio between the weights of the arcs and their predicted coverage."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5266","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5267","fieldValue":" Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a life threatening disease of the human immune system caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Effective inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity is a prominent, clinically viable approach for the treatment of AIDS. Few non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) as drugs for AIDS. In order to enhance therapeutic options against AIDS we examined novel herbal compounds of 4-thiazolidinone and its derivatives that are known to have remarkable antiviral potency. Our molecular docking and simulation experiments have identified one such herbal molecule known as (5E)-3-(2-aminoethyl)-5-benzylidene-1, 3-thiazolidine-2,4-dione that may bind HIV-1RT with high affinity to cause noncompetitive inhibition. Results are also compared with other US FDA approved drugs. Long de novo simulations and docking study suggest that the ligand (5E)-3-(2-aminoethyl)-5-benzylidene-1, 3-thiazolidine-2,4-dione (CID: 1656714) has strong binding interactions with Asp113, Asp110, Asp185 and Asp186 amino acids, all of which belong to one or the other catalytic pockets of HIV-1RT. It is expected that these interactions could be critical in the inhibitory activity of the HIV-1RT. Therefore, this study provides an evidence for consideration of (5E)-3-(2-aminoethyl)-5-benzylidene-1, 3-thiazolidine-2,4-dione as a valuable natural molecule in the treatment and prevention of HIV- associated disorders."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5267","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5267","fieldValue":"ACM"}
