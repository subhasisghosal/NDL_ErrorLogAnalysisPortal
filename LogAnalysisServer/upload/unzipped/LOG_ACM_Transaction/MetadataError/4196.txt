As an example, the problem of storing the Tr√©sor de la Langue Fran&ccidel;aise on a CD-ROM is examined in this paper. The text alone of this database is 700 megabytes long, more than a CD-ROM can hold. In addition, the dictionary and concordance needed to access these data must be stored. A further constraint is that some of the material is copyrighted, and it is desirable that such material be difficult to decode except through software provided by the system. Pertinent approaches to compression of the various files are reviewed, and the compression of the text is related to the problem of data encryption: Specifically, it is shown that, under simple models of text generation, Huffman encoding produces a bit-string indistinguishable from a representation of coin flips."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23648","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23648","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23649","fieldValue":" Research on the nature of knowledge-based systems for bibliographic information retrieval is summarized. Knowledge-based search tactics are then considered in terms of their role in the functioning of a semantically based search system for bibliographic information retrieval, EP-X. This system uses such tactics to actively assist users in defining or refining their topics of interest. It does so by applying these tactics to a knowledge base describing topics in a particular domain and to a database describing the contents of individual documents in terms of these topics. This paper, then, focuses on the two central concepts behind EP-X: semantically based search and knowledge-based search tactics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23649","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23649","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23650","fieldValue":" Hypertext offers users a simple, flexible way to navigate through electronic information systems but at the potential risk of becoming lost in the network of interconnected pieces of information. A study was conducted on information retrieval using a commercial hypertext-based help system. It was found that the predominant search strategy was ‚\u20ACúbrowsing‚\u20AC? (characterized by scanning tables of contents and paging through topics), rather than employing the indexes (\"analytical search\"). Although subjects did not get lost, individuals with better spatial visualization skills, as measured by a standardized test, were faster at retrieving information and returned to the top of the information hierarchy less often than those with poorer spatial visualization skills. These results support previous studies that have found a strong preference by users for browsing in hypertext systems and extend those findings to a new domain (help), a different type of user interface, and a different information architecture. In addition, the results demonstrate the importance of spatial visualization ability for efficient navigation and information retrieval in a hierarchical hypertext system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23650","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23650","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3295","fieldValue":" Three studies were conducted to examine whether men and women differ in how they recalibrate their path-integration systems when walking without vision in virtual environments. Distance cues provided by a scene and a tone, which ended each trial, were placed in conflict. Participants briefly viewed a room with a target, which was offset from their midlines and hung inside a doorframe on the far wall. After viewing, participants walked to the target's position until a tone sounded, ending the trial. In two experiments the doorframe was placed at 6 m and the tone sounded at 4 or 8 m. The rooms had minimal or photorealistic texturing applied. The third experiment used photorealistic texturing, but here the tone sounded at 6 m and the doorframe was presented at 4 or 8 m. Path angles were recorded to estimate perceived distance to the target. In all conditions tested, the women failed to scale their path angles. The men, however, scaled their path-angles with the auditory cue in the minimal-texture condition, but with the visual cue in the photorealistic-texture conditions. These results suggest that gender differences exist in the way that humans recalibrate their path-integration systems when walking without vision in virtual environments."}
