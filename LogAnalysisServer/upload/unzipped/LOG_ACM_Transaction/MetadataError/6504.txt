To annotate the images more accurately, we propose a novel kNN-sparse graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for harnessing the labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously. The sparse graph constructed by datum-wise one-vs-kNN sparse reconstructions of all samples can remove most of the semantically unrelated links among the data, and thus it is more robust and discriminative than the conventional graphs. Meanwhile, we apply the approximate k nearest neighbors to accelerate the sparse graph construction without loosing its effectiveness. More importantly, we propose an effective training label refinement strategy within this graph-based learning framework to handle the noise in the training labels, by bringing in a dual regularization for both the quantity and sparsity of the noise. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world image database consisting of 55,615 Flickr images and noisily tagged training labels. The results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach and its capability to deal with the noise in the training labels."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/7337","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>NN"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7338","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a method to perform automatic player trajectories mapping based on player detection, unsupervised labeling, efficient multi-object tracking, and playfield registration in broadcast soccer videos. Player detector determines the players' positions and scales by combining the ability of dominant color based background subtraction and a boosting detector with Haar features. We first learn the dominant color with accumulate color histogram at the beginning of processing, then use the player detector to collect hundreds of player samples, and learn player appearance codebook by unsupervised clustering. In a soccer game, a player can be labeled as one of four categories: two teams, referee or outlier. The learning capability enables the method to be generalized well to different videos without any manual initialization. With the dominant color and player appearance model, we can locate and label each player. After that, we perform multi-object tracking by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) data association to generate player trajectories. Some data driven dynamics are proposed to improve the Markov chain's efficiency, such as label consistency, motion consistency, and track length, etc. Finally, we extract key-points and find the mapping from an image plane to the standard field model, and then map players' position and trajectories to the field. A large quantity of experimental results on FIFA World Cup 2006 videos demonstrate that this method can reach high detection and labeling precision, reliably tracking in scenes of player occlusion, moderate camera motion and pose variation, and yield promising field registration results."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7338","fieldValue":"MCMC"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7338","fieldValue":"Automatic player labeling, tracking and field registration and trajectory mapping in broadcast soccer video"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7339","fieldValue":" The threat posed by hackers, spies, terrorists, and criminals, etc. using steganography for stealthy communications and other illegal purposes is a serious concern of cyber security. Several steganographic systems that have been developed and made readily available utilize JPEG images as carriers. Due to the popularity of JPEG images on the Internet, effective steganalysis techniques are called for to counter the threat of JPEG steganography. In this article, we propose a new approach based on feature mining on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain and machine learning for steganalysis of JPEG images. First, neighboring joint density features on both intra-block and inter-block are extracted from the DCT coefficient array and the absolute array, respectively; then a support vector machine (SVM) is applied to the features for detection. An evolving neural-fuzzy inference system is employed to predict the hiding amount in JPEG steganograms. We also adopt a feature selection method of support vector machine recursive feature elimination to reduce the number of features. Experimental results show that, in detecting several JPEG-based steganographic systems, our method prominently outperforms the well-known Markov-process based approach."}
