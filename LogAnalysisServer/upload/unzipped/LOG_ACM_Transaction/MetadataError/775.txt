Online error detection techniques, including logic implication-based checker hardware, are capable of detecting at least some of these errors as they occur. However, recovery may be expensive, and the underlying problem may lead to multiple failures of a core over time. In this article, we will investigate the diagnostic capability of logic implications to identify possible failure locations when an error is detected online. We will then utilize this information to select a highly efficient test set that can be used to effectively test the identified suspect locations in both the failing core and in other identical cores in the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13308","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13308","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13309","fieldValue":" While sizing has been studied for over three decades, the absence of a common framework with which to compare methods has made progress difficult to measure. In this article, we compare popular sizing techniques in which gates are chosen from a discrete standard cell library and slew and interconnect effects are accounted for. The difference between sizing methods reduces from roughly 53&percnt; to 8&percnt; between best and worst case after slew propagation is taken into account. In our benchmarks, no one sizing technique consistently outperforms the others."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13310","fieldValue":" Changes in the manufacturing process parameters may create timing violations in a design, making it necessary to perform an engineering change order (ECO) to correct these problems. We present a framework for performing incremental gate sizing for process changes late in the design cycle, and a method for creating initial designs that are robust to late process changes. This includes a method for measuring and estimating ECO cost and for transforming these costs into linear programming optimization problems. In the case of ECOs, the method reduces ECO costs on average, by 89&percnt; in changed area compared to a leading commercial tool. Furthermore, the robust initial designs are, on average, 55&percnt; less likely to need redesign in the future."}
