{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1452","fieldValue":" In the United States alone, more than five million people are living with long term motor impairments caused by a stroke. Recently, video games with affordable motion-based input devices have been proposed as a part of therapy to help people recover lost range of motion and motor control. While researchers have demonstrated the potential utility of therapeutic games through controlled studies, relatively little work has explored their long-term home-based use. We conducted a six-week home study with a 62-year-old woman who was seventeen years post-stroke. She played therapeutic games for approximately one hour a day, five days a week. Over the six weeks, she recovered significant motor abilities, which is unexpected given the time since her stroke. We explore detecting such improvements early, using game logs for daily measurements of motor ability to complement the standard measurements that are taken less often. Through observations and interviews, we present lessons learned about the barriers and opportunities that arise from long-term home-based use of therapeutic games."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5311","fieldValue":" Automated image analysis of microscopic images such as protein crystallization images and cellular images is one of the important research areas. If objects in a scene appear at different depths with respect to the camera&#x0027;s focal point, objects outside the depth of field usually appear blurred. Therefore, scientists capture a collection of images with different depths of field. Focal stacking is a technique of creating a single focused image from a stack of images collected with different depths of field. In this paper, we introduce a novel focal stacking technique, FocusALL, which is based on our modified Harris Corner Response Measure. We also propose enhanced FocusALL for application on images collected under high resolution and varying illumination. FocusALL resolves problems related to the assumption that focus regions have high contrast and high intensity. Especially, FocusALL generates sharper boundaries around protein crystal regions and good in focus images for high resolution images in reasonable time. FocusALL outperforms other methods on protein crystallization images and performs comparably well on other datasets such as retinal epithelial images and simulated datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5311","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5311","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5311","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5312","fieldValue":" Analysis of metagenomic sequence data requires a multi-stage workflow. The results of each intermediate step possess an inherent uncertainty and potentially impact the as-yet-unmeasured statistical significance of downstream analyses. Here, we describe our phylogenetic analysis pipeline which uses the pplacer program to place many shotgun sequences corresponding to a single functional gene onto a fixed phylogenetic tree. We then use the squash clustering method to compare multiple samples with respect to that gene. We approximate the statistical significance of each gene&#x0027;s clustering result by measuring its cluster stability, the consistency of that clustering result when the probabilistic placements made by pplacer are systematically reassigned and then clustered again, as measured by the adjusted Rand Index. We find that among the genes investigated, the majority of analyses are stable, based on the average adjusted Rand Index. We investigated properties of each gene that may explain less stable results. These genes tended to have less convex reference trees, less total reads recruited to the gene, and a greater Expected Distance between Placement Locations as given by pplacer when examined in aggregate. However, for an individual functional gene, these measures alone do not predict cluster stability."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5312","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5312","fieldValue":"Measuring Cluster Stability in a Large Scale Phylogenetic Analysis of Functional Genes in Metagenomes Using pplacer"}
