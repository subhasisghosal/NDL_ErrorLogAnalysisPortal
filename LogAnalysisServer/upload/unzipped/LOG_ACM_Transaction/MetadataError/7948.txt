We find that many goals for network deployment, such as maximizing the number of covered users, the size of the coverage area, or the total throughput of the network, can be modeled with a submodular set function. Specifically, given a set of routers, the goal is to find a set of locations S, each of which is equipped with a router, such that S maximizes a predefined submodular set function. However, this deployment problem is more difficult than the traditional maximum submodular set function problem, e.g., the maximum coverage problem, because it requires all the deployed routers to form a connected network. In addition, deploying a router in different locations might consume different costs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces two approximation algorithms, one for homogeneous deployment cost scenarios and the other for heterogeneous deployment cost scenarios. Our simulations, using synthetic data and real traces of census in Taipei, Taiwan, show that the proposed algorithms achieve better performances than other heuristics."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10713","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10713","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10713","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10714","fieldValue":" Multiview video has recently emerged as a means to improve user experience in novel multimedia services. We propose a new stochastic model to characterize the traffic generated by a Multiview Video Coding (MVC) variable bit-rate source. To this aim, we resort to a Poisson hidden Markov model (P-HMM), in which the first (hidden) layer represents the evolution of the video activity and the second layer represents the frame sizes of the multiple encoded views. We propose a method for estimating the model parameters in long MVC sequences. We then present extensive numerical simulations assessing the model's ability to produce traffic with realistic characteristics for a general class of MVC sequences. We then extend our framework to network applications where we show that our model is able to accurately describe the sender and receiver buffers behavior in MVC transmission. Finally, we derive a model of user behavior for interactive view selection, which, in conjunction with our trafficmodel, is able to accurately predict actual network load in interactive multiview services."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10714","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
