We present an overview of the work that has been done in the modeling, simulation, sensitivity analysis, and optimization of hybrid systems, paying particular attention to the interaction between discrete and continuous dynamics. A concise intuitive framework for hybrid system modeling is presented, together with discussions on robust state event location, transfer functions of the continuous state at discontinuities, parametric sensitivity analysis of hybrid systems, and challenges in optimization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24861","fieldValue":" Metamodeling is one of the core foundations of computer-automated multiparadigm modeling. However, there is currently little agreement about what form the required metamodeling approach should take and precisely what role metamodels should play. This article addresses the problem by first describing some fundamental problems in the industry's leading metamodeling technology, the UML framework, and then explaining how this framework could be rearchitected to overcome these problems. Three main issues are identified in the current framework: the dual classification problem arising from the need to capture both the logical and physical classification of model elements, the class\/object duality problem arising from the need to capture both the classlike and objectlike facets of some model elements, and the replication of concepts problem arising from the need to define certain concepts multiple times. Three main proposals for rearchitecting the UML framework to overcome these problems are then presented: the separation of logical and physical classification dimensions, the unification of the class and object facets of model elements, and the enhancement of the instantiation mechanism to allow definitions to transcend multiple levels. The article concludes with a discussion of other practical issues involved in rearchitecting the UML modeling framework in the proposed way."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24862","fieldValue":" This article introduces the EIA\/CDIF set of standards for the modeling of information systems and its exchange among computer-aided software tools of different vendors.
