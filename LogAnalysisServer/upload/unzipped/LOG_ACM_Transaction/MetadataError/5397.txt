We present a study which shows that QPNs define monotonic relations that are capable of identifying regulatory interactions in a manner that is less susceptible to the many sources of uncertainty that surround gene expression data. Moreover, we construct a model that maps the regulatory interactions of genetic networks to QPN constructs and show its capability in providing a set of candidate regulators for target genes, which is subsequently used to establish a prior structure that the DBN learning algorithm can use and which 1) distinguishes spurious correlations from true regulations, 2) enables the discovery of sets of coregulators of target genes, and 3) results in a more efficient construction of gene regulatory networks. The model is compared to the existing literature using the known gene regulatory interactions of Drosophila Melanogaster."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4569","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4569","fieldValue":"Gene regulatory networks, reverse-engineering genetic networks, dynamic Bayesian networks, qualitative probabilistic networks, qualitative reasoning."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4569","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4569","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4570","fieldValue":" Computational systems biology is largely driven by mathematical modeling and simulation of biochemical networks, via continuous deterministic methods or discrete event stochastic methods. Although the deterministic methods are efficient in predicting the macroscopic behavior of a biochemical system, they are severely limited by their inability to represent the stochastic effects of random molecular fluctuations at lower concentration. In this work, we have presented a novel method for simulating biochemical networks based on a deterministic solution with a modification that permits the incorporation of stochastic effects. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we have tested our method on three previously reported biochemical networks. The results, while staying true to their deterministic form, also reflect the stochastic effects of random fluctuations that are dominant as the system transitions into a lower concentration. This ability to adapt to a concentration gradient makes this method particularly attractive for systems biology-based applications."}
