From a mathematical point of view, the employed encryption algorithms (e.g., Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or 3DES) are highly secure. However, it has been shown that the bitstream encryption feature of several FPGA families is susceptible to side-channel attacks based on measuring the power consumption of the cryptographic module. In this article, we present the first successful attack on the bitstream encryption of the Altera Stratix II and Stratix III FPGA families. To this end, we analyzed the Quartus II software and reverse engineered the details of the proprietary and unpublished schemes used for bitstream encryption on Stratix II and Stratix III. Using this knowledge, we demonstrate that the full 128-bit AES key of a Stratix II as well as the full 256-bit AES key of a Stratix III can be recovered by means of side-channel attacks. In both cases, the attack can be conducted in a few hours. The complete bitstream of these FPGAs that are (seemingly) protected by the bitstream encryption feature can hence fall into the hands of a competitor or criminalâ\u20AC\u201Dpossibly implying system-wide damage if confidential information such as proprietary encryption schemes or secret keys programmed into the FPGA are extracted. In addition to lost IP, reprogramming the attacked FPGA with modified code, for instance, to secretly plant a hardware Trojan, is a particularly dangerous scenario for many security-critical applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21875","fieldValue":"AES"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21875","fieldValue":"Physical Security Evaluation of the Bitstream Encryption Mechanism of Altera Stratix II and Stratix III FPGAs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21876","fieldValue":" With the widespread availability of broadband Internet, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can get remote updates in the field. This provides hardware and software updates, and enables issue solving and upgrade ability without device modification. In order to prevent an attacker from eavesdropping or manipulating the configuration data, security is a necessity. This work describes an architecture that allows the secure, remote reconfiguration of an FPGA. The architecture is partially dynamically reconfigurable and it consists of a static partition that handles the secure communication protocol and a single reconfigurable partition that holds the main application. Our solution distinguishes itself from existing work in two ways: it provides entity authentication and it avoids the use of a trusted third party. The former provides protection against active attackers on the communication channel, while the latter reduces the number of reliable entities. Additionally, this work provides basic countermeasures against simple power-oriented side-channel analysis attacks. The result is an implementation that is optimized toward minimal resource occupation. Because configuration updates occur infrequently, configuration speed is of minor importance with respect to area. A prototype of the proposed design is implemented, using 5,702 slices and having minimal downtime."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21876","fieldValue":"DPR"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21876","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21876","fieldValue":"ACM"}
