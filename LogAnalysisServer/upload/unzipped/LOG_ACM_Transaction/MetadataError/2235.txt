The key challenge is how to model and simulate sub-pixel paint details, given the limited computational resource in each time step. To achieve this goal, we propose to define paint liquid in a hybrid fashion: the liquid close to the brush is modeled by particles, and the liquid away from the brush is modeled by a density field. Based on this representation, we develop a variety of techniques to ensure the performance and robustness of our simulator under large time steps, including brush and particle simulations in non-inertial frames, a fixed-point method for accelerating Jacobi iterations, and a new Eulerian-Lagrangian approach for simulating detailed liquid effects. The resulting system can realistically simulate not only the motions of brush bristles and paint liquid, but also the liquid transfer processes among different representations. We implement the whole system on GPU by CUDA. Our experiment shows that artists can use the system to draw realistic and vivid digital paintings, by applying the painting techniques that they are familiar with but not offered by many existing systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17436","fieldValue":"FLIP\/PIC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17436","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17436","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2649","fieldValue":"Katz, Matthew J"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2649","fieldValue":" The Fr√©chet distance is a well-studied similarity measure between curves. The discrete Fr√©chet distance is an analogous similarity measure, defined for two sequences of m and n points, where the points are usually sampled from input curves. We consider a variant, called the discrete Fr√©chet distance with shortcuts, which captures the similarity between (sampled) curves in the presence of outliers. When shortcuts are allowed only in one noise-containing curve, we give a randomized algorithm that runs in O((m &plus; $n)^6&sol;5 &plus; &epsiv;) expected time, for any &epsiv; > 0. When shortcuts are allowed in both curves, we give an O((m2&sol;3n2&sol;3 &plus; m &plus; n)log‚\u20AC\u20303(m &plus; n))-time deterministic algorithm. We also consider the semicontinuous Fr√©chet distance with one-sided shortcuts, where we have a sequence of m points and a polygonal curve of n edges, and shortcuts are allowed only in the sequence. We show that this problem can be solved in randomized expected time O((m &plus; n)2&sol;3m2&sol;3n1&sol;3$log‚\u20AC\u2030(m &plus; n)). Our techniques are novel and may find further applications. One of the main new technical results is: Given two sets of points A and B in the plane and an interval I, we develop an algorithm that decides whether the number of pairs (x, y) ‚àà A √\u2014 B whose distance dist(x, y) is in I is less than some given threshold L. The running time of this algorithm decreases as L increases. In case there are more than L pairs of points whose distance is in I, we can get a small sample of pairs that contain a pair at approximate median distance (i.e., we can approximately ‚\u20ACúbisect‚\u20AC? I). We combine this procedure with additional ideas to search, with a small overhead, for the optimal one-sided Fr√©chet distance with shortcuts, using a very fast decision procedure. We also show how to apply this technique for approximating distance selection (with respect to rank), and a somewhat more involved variant of this technique is used in the solution of the semicontinuous Fr√©chet distance with one-sided shortcuts. In general, the new technique can be applied to optimization problems for which the decision procedure is very fast but standard techniques like parametric search makes the optimization algorithm substantially slower."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2649","fieldValue":"Discrete Fr&eacute;chet distance"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2649","fieldValue":"The Discrete and Semicontinuous Fr√©chet Distance with Shortcuts via Approximate Distance Counting and Selection"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2649","fieldValue":"ACM"}
