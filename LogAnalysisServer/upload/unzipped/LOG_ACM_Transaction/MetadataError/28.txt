The topics covered by this new journal will range across diverse aspects of computing education: traditional computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, information technology, and informatics; emerging aspects of computing; and applications of computing to other disciplines, such as computational biology. The common characteristics shared by these articles are a scholarly approach to teaching and learning, a broad appeal to educational practitioners, and a clear connection to student learning."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11077","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11077","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11078","fieldValue":" The value and the pitfalls of project and group work are well recognized. The principles and elements which apply to projects in general, apply to project-based courses. Thoughtful and detailed planning, understanding of the stakeholders and their needs, a good design, appropriate testing, monitoring and quality control and continual management can maximize the benefits and minimize the negatives. In this article we draw together the literature to consider key design choices of project-based courses considering: type, length, size, management, participants, and content with a particular focus on the composition of groups and the issues surrounding assessment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11078","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11078","fieldValue":"ACM"}
