TTS can provide each node with guaranteed success in each schedule without any detailed topology information and yields a guaranteed upper bound on the transmission delay of each packet at every node in a MANET. In general, TTS requires two global constraints on the number of nodes in the MANET and the maximum nodal degree of the graph representing connectivity of the MANET. Due to the inherent mobility of MANETs, the maximum nodal degree, however, cannot be available or easily estimated. To eliminate the requirement for the maximum nodal degree, this paper proposes TTS via the CRT. By the redundancy property of the Chinese remainder representation, the proposed CRT-based scheme not only preserves the advantages of providing guaranteed success in each schedule with only the global constraint on the number of nodes in the MANET, but also offers flexibility in constructing TTS. To have a better transmission delay bound for a node with lower interference, this paper also introduces two threaded counterparts of the proposed CRT-based scheme. This paper provides performance analyses for the proposed CRT-based scheme and its threaded counterparts. Numerical results demonstrate that TTS via the CRT can outperform existing schemes, especially in scenarios with harsh interference, and is a versatile approach for the design of TTS."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10802","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10802","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10802","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10803","fieldValue":" We study deadline-aware scheduling with adaptive network coding (NC) for real-time traffic over a single-hop wireless network. To meet hard deadlines of real-time traffic, the block size for NC is adapted based on the remaining time to the deadline so as to strike a balance between maximizing the throughput and minimizing the risk that the entire block of coded packets may not be decodable by the deadline. This sequential block size adaptation problem is then cast as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. One interesting finding is that the optimal block size and its corresponding action space monotonically decrease as the deadline approaches, and that the optimal block size is bounded by the \"greedy\" block size. These unique structures make it possible to significantly narrow down the search space of dynamic programming, building on which we develop a monotonicity-based backward induction algorithm (MBIA) that can find the optimal block size in polynomial time. Furthermore, a joint real-time scheduling and channel learning scheme with adaptive NC is developed to adapt to channel dynamics in a mobile network environment. Then, we generalize the analysis to multiple flows with hard deadlines and long-term delivery ratio constraints. We devise a low-complexity online scheduling algorithm integrated with the MBIA, and then establish its asymptotical utility optimality. The analysis and simulation results are corroborated by high-fidelity wireless emulation tests, where actual radio transmissions over emulated channels are performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the MBIA in finding the optimal block size in real time."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10803","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10803","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10803","fieldValue":"ACM"}
