For a constrained traffic-regulation problem with maximum tolerable delay d and maximum buffer size q, the optimal regulator that generates the output traffic conforming to a së«?itive envelope f and minimizes the number of discarded packets is a concatenation of the g-clipper with g(t) = min[f(t+d), f(t) + q] and the maximal f-regulator. The g-clipper is a bufferless device, which optimally drops packets as necessary in order that its output be conformant to an envelope g. The maximal f-regulator is a buffered device that delays packets as necessary in order that its output be conformant to an envelope f. The maximal f-regulator is a linear time-invariant filter with impulse response f, under the (min, +) algebra.To provide dynamic service guarantees in a network, we develop the concept of a dynamic server as a basic network element. Dynamic servers can be joined by concatenation, \"filter bank summation,\" and feedback to form a composite dynamic server. We also show that dynamic service guarantees for multiple input streams sharing a work-conserving link can be achieved by a dynamic service curve earliest deadline scheduling algorithm, if an appropriate admission control is enforced."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9134","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9134","fieldValue":"(min, +) algebra"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9134","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9134","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9135","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of allocating bandwidth between two endpoints of a backbone network so that no parts of the network are unnecessarily loaded.

The solution consists of: 1) identifying a cut in the network where the optimal load can be determined on all the links of the cut and 2) considering the same problem for each of the subnetworks to which the cut is dividing the original network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9135","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
