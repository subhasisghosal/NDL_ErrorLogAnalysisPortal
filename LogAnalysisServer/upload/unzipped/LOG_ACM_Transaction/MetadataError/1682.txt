We derive the aliasing error equations for both types of light sources in general position. Using these equations we compute tight bounds on the aliasing error. From these bounds we derive our shadow map parameterization, which is a simple combination of a perspective projection with a logarithmic transformation. We formulate several types of logarithmic perspective shadow maps (LogPSMs) by replacing the parameterization of existing algorithms with our own. We perform an extensive error analysis for both LogPSMs and existing algorithms. This analysis is a major contribution of this paper and is useful for gaining insight into existing techniques. We show that compared with competing algorithms, LogPSMs can produce significantly less aliasing error. Equivalently, for the same error as competing algorithms, LogPSMs can produce significant savings in both storage and bandwidth. We demonstrate the benefit of LogPSMs for several models of varying complexity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16037","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16037","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16038","fieldValue":" The spatial deformation methods are a family of modeling and animation techniques for indirectly reshaping an object by warping the surrounding space, with results that are similar to molding a highly malleable substance. They have the virtue of being computationally efficient (and hence interactive) and applicable to a variety of object representations. In this article we survey the state of the art in spatial deformation. Since manipulating ambient space directly is infeasible, deformations are controlled by tools of varying dimensionâ\u20AC\u201Dpoints, curves, surfaces and volumesâ\u20AC\u201Dand it is on this basis that we classify them. Unlike previous surveys that concentrate on providing a single underlying mathematical formalism, we use the user-centered criteria of versatility, ease of use, efficiency and correctness to compare techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16038","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16038","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16039","fieldValue":" One way that artists create compelling character animations is by manipulating details of a character's motion. This process is expensive and repetitive. We show that we can make such motion editing more efficient by generalizing the edits an animator makes on short sequences of motion to other sequences. Our method predicts frames for the motion using Gaussian process models of kinematics and dynamics. These estimates are combined with probabilistic inference. Our method can be used to propagate edits from examples to an entire sequence for an existing character, and it can also be used to map a motion from a control character to a very different target character. The technique shows good generalization. For example, we show that an estimator, learned from a few seconds of edited example animation using our methods, generalizes well enough to edit minutes of character animation in a high-quality fashion. Learning is interactive: An animator who wants to improve the output can provide small, correcting examples and the system will produce improved estimates of motion. We make this interactive learning process efficient and natural with a fast, full-body IK system with novel features. Finally, we present data from interviews with professional character animators that indicate that generalizing and propagating animator edits can save artists significant time and work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16039","fieldValue":"ACM"}
