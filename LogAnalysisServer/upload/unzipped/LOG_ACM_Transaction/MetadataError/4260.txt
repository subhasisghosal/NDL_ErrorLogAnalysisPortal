By combining our knowledge of existing process models with data from a field study, the paper develops criteria for an effective process representation. Using these criteria and the case study, the paper integrates the process redesign and information system literatures to develop a representation framework that captures a process' social context. The paper argues that this social context framework, which represents people's motivations, social relationships, and social constraints, gives redesigners a richer sense of the process and allows process redesigners to simultaneously change social and logistic systems. The paper demonstrates the framework and some of its benefits and limitations."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23825","fieldValue":"Beneath the surface of organizational processes: a social representation framework for business process redesign"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23825","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23825","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23826","fieldValue":" In this paper, we extend the scope of mining association rules from traditional single-dimensional intratransaction associations, to multidimensional intertransaction associations. Intratransaction associations are the associations among items with the same transaction, where the notion of the transaction could be the items bought by the same customer, the events happened on the same day, and so on. However, an intertransaction association describes the association relationships among different transactions, such as â\u20ACœif(company) A's stock goes up on day 1, B's stock will go down on day 2, but go up on day 4.â\u20AC? In this case, whether we treat company or day as the unit of transaction, the associated items belong to different transactions. Moreover, such an intertransaction association can be extended to associate multiple contextual properties in the same rule, so that multidimensional intertransaction associations can be defined and discovered. A two-dimensional intertransaction association rule example is â\u20ACœAfter McDonald and Burger King open branches, KFC will open a branch two months later and one mile away,â\u20AC? which involves two dimensions: time and space. Mining intertransaction associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than mining intratransaction associations. Interestingly, intratransaction association can be treated as a special case of intertransaction association from both a conceptual and algorithmic point of view. In this study, we introduce the notion of multidimensional intertransaction association rules, study their measurementsâ\u20AC\u201Dsupport and confidenceâ\u20AC\u201Dand develop algorithms for mining intertransaction associations by extension of Apriori. We overview our experience using the algorithms on both real-life and synthetic data sets. Further extensions of multidimensional intertransaction association rules and potential applications are also discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23826","fieldValue":"Beyond intratransaction association analysis: mining multidimensional intertransaction association rules"}
