The proposed approach focus on whether visual feedback is able to induce a sensation of stiffness when the user interacts with an image using a standard mouse. The user, when clicking on a Elastic Image, is able to deform it locally according to its elastic properties. To reinforce the effect, we also propose the generation of procedural shadows and creases to simulate the compressibility of the image and several mouse cursors replacements to enhance pressure and stiffness perception. A psychophysical experiment was conducted to quantify this novel pseudo-haptic perception and determine its perceptual threshold (or its Just Noticeable Difference). The results showed that users were able to recognize up to eight different stiffness values with our proposed method and confirmed that it provides a perceivable and exploitable sensation of elasticity. The potential applications of the proposed approach range from pressure sensing in product catalogs and games, or its usage in graphical user interfaces for increasing the expressiveness of widgets."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3454","fieldValue":"Elastic images: Perceiving local elasticity of images through a novel pseudo-haptic deformation effect"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25406","fieldValue":" This article presents an interactive application that enables users to improve the visual aesthetics of their digital photographs using several novel spatial recompositing techniques. This work differs from earlier efforts in two important aspects: (1) it focuses on both photo quality assessment and improvement in an integrated fashion, (2) it enables the user to make informed decisions about improving the composition of a photograph. The tool facilitates interactive selection of one or more than one foreground objects present in a given composition, and the system presents recommendations for where it can be relocated in a manner that optimizes a learned aesthetic metric while obeying semantic constraints. For photographic compositions that lack a distinct foreground object, the tool provides the user with crop or expansion recommendations that improve the aesthetic appeal by equalizing the distribution of visual weights between semantically different regions. The recomposition techniques presented in the article emphasize learning support vector regression models that capture visual aesthetics from user data and seek to optimize this metric iteratively to increase the image appeal. The tool demonstrates promising aesthetic assessment and enhancement results on variety of images and provides insightful directions towards future research."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25406","fieldValue":"ACM"}
