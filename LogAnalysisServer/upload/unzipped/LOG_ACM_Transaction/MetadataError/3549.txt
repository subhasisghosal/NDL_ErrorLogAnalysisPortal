However, those challenging environments also pose significant challenges to network sustainability and reliability. In such environments, the network often becomes disruptive and even unavailable during downtime. This results in undesired loss of valuable spatial-temporal sensor data. Data persistence can be achieved by using in-situ encoding and caching of data through distributed mechanisms. However, the existing methods in the literature are mainly based on network random walks, which not only incur significant communication overhead, but also are prone to network or node failures. In this article, we present ECPC, a distributed Erasure Coding with randomized Power Control protocol for preserving data in disruptive sensor networks. ECPC only requires each sensor node to perform several rounds of broadcast in its neighborhood at some randomly chosen radio transmission power levels, and thus it incurs low communication overhead. We proved that ECPC achieves the expected code degree distribution and pseudo-global randomness of erasure coding principles. We have also evaluated the performance of ECPC by comparing it with several key related approaches in the literature (such as EDFC and RCDS). The performance comparisons validate that our proposed ECPC protocol can reach higher data reliability under varying node failure probabilities. In addition, ECPC protocol is also shown to be scalable with different network sizes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21542","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21542","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21543","fieldValue":" Unit testing, an important facet of software quality assurance, is underappreciated by wireless sensor network (sensornet) developers. This is likely because our tools lag behind the rest of the computing field. As a remedy, we present a new framework that enables modern unit testing techniques in sensornets. Although the framework takes a holistic approach to unit testing, its novelty lies mainly in two aspects. First, to boost test development, it introduces embedded mock modules that automatically abstract out dependencies of tested code. Second, to automate test assessment, it provides embedded code coverage tools that identify untested control flow paths in the code. We demonstrate that in sensornets these features pose unique problems, solving which requires dedicated support from the compiler and operating system. However, the solutions have the potential to offer substantial benefits. In particular, they reduce the unit test development effort by a few factors compared to existing solutions. At the same time, they facilitate obtaining full code coverage, compared to merely 57--72&percnt; that can be achieved with integration tests. They also allow for intercepting and reporting many classes of runtime failures, thereby simplifying the diagnosis of software flaws. Finally, they enable fine-grained management of the quality of sensornet software."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21543","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21543","fieldValue":"ACM"}
