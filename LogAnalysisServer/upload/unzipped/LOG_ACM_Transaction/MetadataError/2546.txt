First, CHABIS locates at least one solution of the system within an n-dimensional polyhedron. Then, it applies a new generalized method of bisection to this n-polyhedron in order to obtain an approximate solution of the system according to a predetermined accuracy. In this paper we briefly describe the user interface to CHABIS and present several details of its implementation, as well as an example of its usage."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18592","fieldValue":"Algorithm 666: Chabis: a mathematical software package for locating and evaluating roots of systems of nonlinear equations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18592","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18592","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18593","fieldValue":" Although the cycle index polynomial for a permutation group can often be easily determined, expansion of the figure counting series in a Po´lya enumeration presents computational difficulties for object sets with higher degrees of symmetry and more than modest size. An algorithm that does not require algebraic symbol manipulation is derived for multiplying symmetric polynomials represented by partitions. Because the repetitive identification and collection of common terms are eliminated and storage requirements reduced, this algorithm is useful in rapidly expanding the figure counting series in such Po´lya enumeration problems as the counting of chemical isomers."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/18593","fieldValue":"Po&acute;lya enumeration"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18593","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18593","fieldValue":"ACM"}
