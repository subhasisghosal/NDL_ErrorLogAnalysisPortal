Having a signal dependent transform has shown some advantages over the traditional signal independent transform. Recently, the single-channel noise reduction problem in the Karhunen-Lo√®ve expansion (KLE) domain has received special attention. In this paper, the noise reduction problem in the KLE domain is studied from a multichannel perspective. We present a new formulation of the problem, in which inter-channel and inter-mode correlations are optimally exploited. We derive different optimal noise reduction filters and present a set of useful performance measures within this framework. The performance of the different filters is then evaluated through experiments in which not only noise but also competing speech sources are present. It is shown that the proposed multichannel formulation is more robust to competing speech sources than the single-channel approach and that a better compromise between noise reduction and speech distortion can be obtained."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/3651","fieldValue":"Karhunen-Lo&#232;ve expansion (KLE)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3651","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3651","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3652","fieldValue":"Hansen, John H L"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3652","fieldValue":" Room reverberation poses various deleterious effects on performance of automatic speech systems. Speaker identification (SID) performance, in particular, degrades rapidly as reverberation time increases. Reverberation causes two forms of spectro-temporal distortions on speech signals: i) self-masking which is due to early reflections and ii) overlap-masking which is due to late reverberation. Overlap-masking effect of reverberation has been shown to have a greater adverse impact on performance of speech systems. Motivated by this fact, this study proposes a blind spectral weighting (BSW) technique for suppressing the reverberation overlap-masking effect on SID systems. The technique is blind in the sense that prior knowledge of neither the anechoic signal nor the room impulse response is required. Performance of the proposed technique is evaluated on speaker verification tasks under simulated and actual reverberant mismatched conditions. Evaluations are conducted in the context of the conventional GMM-UBM as well as the state-of-the-art i-vector based systems. The GMM-UBM experiments are performed using speech material from a new data corpus well suited for speaker verification experiments under actual reverberant mismatched conditions, entitled MultiRoom8. The i-vector experiments are carried out with microphone (interview and phonecall) data from the NIST SRE 2010 extended evaluation set which are digitally convolved with three different measured room impulse responses extracted from the Aachen impulse response (AIR) database. Experimental results prove that incorporating the proposed blind technique into the standard MFCC feature extraction framework yields significant improvement in SID performance under reverberation mismatch."}
