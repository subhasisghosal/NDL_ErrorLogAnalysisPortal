{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13000","fieldValue":" Power reduction during test application is important from the viewpoint of chip reliability and for obtaining correct test results. One of the ways to reduce scan test power is to block transitions propagating from the outputs of scan cells through combinational logic. In order to accomplish this, some researchers have proposed setting primary inputs to appropriate values or adding extra gates at the outputs of scan cells. In this article, we point out the limitations of such full gating techniques in terms of area overhead and performance degradation. We propose an alternate solution where a partial set of scan cells is gated. A subset of scan cells is selected to give maximum reduction in test power within a given area constraint. An alternate formulation of the problem is to treat maximum permitted test power as a constraint and achieve a test power that is within this limit using the fewest number of gated scan cells, thereby leading to the least impact in area overhead. Our problem formulation also comprehends performance constraints and prevents the inclusion of gating points on critical paths. The area overhead is predictable and closely corresponds to the average power reduction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13001","fieldValue":" We describe a procedure for forming n-detection test sets for n>1 without applying a test generation procedure to target faults. The proposed procedure accepts a one-detection test set. It extracts test cubes for target faults from the one-detection test set, and merges the test cubes to obtain new test vectors. By extracting and merging different test cubes in different iterations of this process, an n-detection test set is obtained. Merging of test cubes does not require test generation or fault simulation. Fault simulation is required for extracting test cubes for target faults. We demonstrate that the resulting test set is as effective in detecting untargeted faults as an n-detection test set generated by a deterministic test generation procedure. We also discuss the application of the proposed procedure starting from a random test set (instead of a one-detection test set)."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/13001","fieldValue":"<i>n<\/i>-detection test sets"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13001","fieldValue":"<i>n<\/i>-detection test sets"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13002","fieldValue":"Wu, Yu-Liang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13002","fieldValue":"Cheung, Chak-Chung"}
