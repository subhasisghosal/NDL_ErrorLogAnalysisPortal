The data-gathering process must be carefully designed to conserve energy and extend network lifetime. For applications where each sensor continuously monitors the environment and periodically reports to a base station, a tree-based topology is often used to collect data from sensor nodes. In this work, we first study the construction of a data-gathering tree when there is a single base station in the network. The objective is to maximize the network lifetime, which is defined as the time until the first node depletes its energy. The problem is shown to be NP-complete. We design an algorithm that starts from an arbitrary tree and iteratively reduces the load on bottleneck nodes (nodes likely to soon deplete their energy due to high degree or low remaining energy). We then extend our work to the case when there are multiple base stations and study the construction of a maximum-lifetime data-gathering forest. We show that both the tree and forest construction algorithms terminate in polynomial time and are provably near optimal. We then verify the efficacy of our algorithms via numerical comparisons."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10079","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10079","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10079","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10080","fieldValue":" It has been conjectured that MWS-α scheduling policies with α going to zero are heavy-traffic optimal for scheduling in a generalized switch when the objective is to minimize the number of backlogged packets in the system. We examine this conjecture by first deriving optimal or heavy-traffic optimal policies for small switches and then comparing them to MWS-α policies by simulation. Our conclusion is that the conjecture is not true in general, i.e., there are simple topologies for which there exist policies that outperform MWS-α in heavy traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10080","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10080","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10080","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10081","fieldValue":"McKeown, Nick"}
