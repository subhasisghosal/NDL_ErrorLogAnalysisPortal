We present a simple image operator called seam carving that supports content-aware image resizing for both reduction and expansion. A seam is an optimal 8-connected path of pixels on a single image from top to bottom, or left to right, where optimality is defined by an image energy function. By repeatedly carving out or inserting seams in one direction we can change the aspect ratio of an image. By applying these operators in both directions we can retarget the image to a new size. The selection and order of seams protect the content of the image, as defined by the energy function. Seam carving can also be used for image content enhancement and object removal. We support various visual saliency measures for defining the energy of an image, and can also include user input to guide the process. By storing the order of seams in an image we create multi-size images, that are able to continuously change in real time to fit a given size."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15767","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15767","fieldValue":" Recently, gradient meshes have been introduced as a powerful vector graphics representation to draw multicolored mesh objects with smooth transitions. Using tools from Abode Illustrator and Corel CorelDraw, a user can manually create gradient meshes even for photo-realistic vector arts, which can be further edited, stylized and animated. In this paper, we present an easy-to-use interactive tool, called optimized gradient mesh, to semi-automatically and quickly create gradient meshes from a raster image. We obtain the optimized gradient mesh by formulating an energy minimization problem. The user can also interactively specify a few vector lines to guide the mesh generation. The resulting optimized gradient mesh is an editable and scalable mesh that otherwise would have taken many hours for a user to manually create."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15767","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15767","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15768","fieldValue":" Shape deformation is a common practice in digital image editing, but can unrealistically stretch or compress texture detail. We propose an image editing system that decouples feature position from pixel color generation, by resynthesizing texture from the source image to preserve its detail and orientation around a new feature curve location. We introduce a new distortion to patch-based texture synthesis that aligns texture features with image features. A dense correspondence field between source and target images generated by the control curves then guides texture synthesis."}
