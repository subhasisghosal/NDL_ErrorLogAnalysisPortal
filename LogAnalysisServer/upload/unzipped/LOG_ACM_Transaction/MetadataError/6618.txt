However, it suffers from data sparsity and scalability problems. Although many clustering techniques have been incorporated to alleviate these two problems, most of them fail to achieve further significant improvement in recommendation accuracy. First of all, most of them assume each user or item belongs to a single cluster. Since usually users can hold multiple interests and items may belong to multiple categories, it is more reasonable to assume that users and items can join multiple clusters (groups), where each cluster is a subset of like-minded users and items they prefer. Furthermore, most of the clustering-based CF models only utilize historical rating information in the clustering procedure but ignore other data resources in recommender systems such as the social connections of users and the correlations between items. In this article, we propose HMCoC, a Hybrid Multigroup CoClustering recommendation framework, which can cluster users and items into multiple groups simultaneously with different information resources. In our framework, we first integrate information of user--item rating records, user social networks, and item features extracted from the DBpedia knowledge base. We then use an optimization method to mine meaningful user--item groups with all the information. Finally, we apply the conventional CF method in each cluster to make predictions. By merging the predictions from each cluster, we generate the top-n recommendations to the target users for return. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in top-n recommendation in terms of MAP, NDCG, and F1 compared with other clustering-based CF models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7625","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7625","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7626","fieldValue":" Online genealogy datasets contain extensive information about millions of people and their past and present family connections. This vast amount of data can help identify various patterns in the human population. In this study, we present methods and algorithms that can assist in identifying variations in lifespan distributions of the human population in the past centuries, in detecting social and genetic features that correlate with the human lifespan, and in constructing predictive models of human lifespan based on various features that can easily be extracted from genealogy datasets. We have evaluated the presented methods and algorithms on a large online genealogy dataset with over a million profiles and over 9 million connections, all of which were collected from the WikiTree website. Our findings indicate that significant but small positive correlations exist between the parentsâ\u20AC™ lifespan and their childrenâ\u20AC™s lifespan. Additionally, we found slightly higher and significant correlations between the lifespans of spouses. We also discovered a very small positive and significant correlation between longevity and reproductive success in males, and a small and significant negative correlation between longevity and reproductive success in females. Moreover, our predictive models presented results with a Mean Absolute Error as low as 13.18 in predicting the lifespans of individuals who outlived the age of 10, and our classification models presented better than random classification results in predicting which people who outlive the age of 50 will also outlive the age of 80. We believe that this study will be the first of many studies to utilize the wealth of data on human populations, existing in online genealogy datasets, to better understand factors that influence the human lifespan. Understanding these factors can assist scientists in providing solutions for successful aging."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7300","fieldValue":"Issue 3(Survey Paper, Regular Papers and Special Section on Participatory Sensing and Crowd Intelligence), May 2015"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7627","fieldValue":" The advances in location-acquisition and mobile computing techniques have generated massive spatial trajectory data, which represent the mobility of a diversity of moving objects, such as people, vehicles, and animals. Many techniques have been proposed for processing, managing, and mining trajectory data in the past decade, fostering a broad range of applications. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey on the major research into trajectory data mining, providing a panorama of the field as well as the scope of its research topics. Following a road map from the derivation of trajectory data, to trajectory data preprocessing, to trajectory data management, and to a variety of mining tasks (such as trajectory pattern mining, outlier detection, and trajectory classification), the survey explores the connections, correlations, and differences among these existing techniques. This survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied. Finally, some public trajectory datasets are presented. This survey can help shape the field of trajectory data mining, providing a quick understanding of this field to the community."}
