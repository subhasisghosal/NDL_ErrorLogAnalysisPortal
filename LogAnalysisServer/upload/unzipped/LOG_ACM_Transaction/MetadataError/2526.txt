Various forms of generalized bisection were proposed some time ago for this task. This paper systematically compares such generalized bisection algorithms to themselves, to continuation methods, and to hybrid steepest descent\/quasi-Newton methods. A specific algorithm containing novel â\u20ACœexpansionâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœexclusionâ\u20AC? steps is fully described, and the effectiveness of these steps is evaluated. A test problem consisting of a small, high-degree polynomial system that is appropriate for generalized bisection, but very difficult for continuation methods, is presented. This problem forms part of a set of 17 test problems from published literature on the methods being compared; this test set is fully described here."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18539","fieldValue":" We present fourth-order-accurate compact discretizations of the Helmholtz equation on rectangular domains in two and three dimensions with any combination of Dirichlet, Neumann, or periodic boundary conditions. The resulting systems of linear algebraic equations have the same block-tridiagonal structure as traditional central differences and hence may be solved efficiently using the Fourier method. The performance of the method for a variety of test cases, including problems with nonsmooth solutions, is presented. The method is seen to be roughly twice as fast as deferred corrections and, in many cases, results in a smaller discretization error."}
