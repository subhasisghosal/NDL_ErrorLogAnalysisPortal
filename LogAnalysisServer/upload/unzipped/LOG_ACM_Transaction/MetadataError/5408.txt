We present a matching algorithm between two TOPS diagrams where the likelihood of a match is measured according to previously known matches between complete 3D structures. This totally new 3D training is recorded on transition matrices that count the likelihood that a given TOPS feature, or combination thereof, is replaced by another feature on homologs. The new algorithm outperforms existing ones on a benchmark database. Some biologically significant examples are discussed as well. The method can be used whenever frequencies of edge relationship matches are known, as it is the case for several biopolymer structures."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4588","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4588","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4588","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4589","fieldValue":" Several gene regulatory network models containing concepts of directionality at the edges have been proposed. However, only a few reports have an interpretable definition of directionality. Here, differently from the standard causality concept defined by Pearl, we introduce the concept of contagion in order to infer directionality at the edges, i.e., asymmetries in gene expression dependences of regulatory networks. Moreover, we present a bootstrap algorithm in order to test the contagion concept. This technique was applied in simulated data and, also, in an actual large sample of biological data. Literature review has confirmed some genes identified by contagion as actually belonging to the TP53 pathway."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4589","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4589","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4589","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4131","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
