{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15608","fieldValue":" We propose a technique, called TextureMontage, to seamlessly map a patchwork of texture images onto an arbitrary 3D model. A texture atlas can be created through the specification of a set of correspondences between the model and any number of texture images. First, our technique automatically partitions the mesh and the images, driven solely by the choice of feature correspondences. Most charts will then be parameterized over their corresponding image planes through the minimization of a distortion metric based on both geometric distortion and texture mismatch across patch boundaries and images. Lastly, a surface texture inpainting technique is used to fill in the remaining charts of the surface with no corresponding texture patches. The resulting texture mapping satisfies the (sparse or dense) user-specified constraints while minimizing the distortion of the texture images and ensuring a smooth transition across the boundaries of different mesh patches.

Our method replaces the hundreds of shadow rays commonly used in stochastic ray tracers with a single shadow ray and a local reconstruction of the visibility function. Compared to tracing the shadow rays. our algorithm produces exactly the same image while executing one to two orders of magnitude faster in the test scenes used. Our first contribution is a two-stage method for quickly determining the silhouette edges that overlap an area light source, as seen from the point to be shaded. Secondly, we show that these partial silhouettes of occluders, along with a single shadow ray, are sufficient for reconstructing the visibility function between the point and the light source."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15609","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15609","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15610","fieldValue":"Akenine-Mller, Tomas"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15610","fieldValue":" We present a new technique for importance sampling products of complex functions using wavelets. First, we generalize previous work on wavelet products to higher dimensional spaces and show how this product can be sampled on-the-fly without the need of evaluating the full product. This makes it possible to sample products of high-dimensional functions even if the product of the two functions in itself is too memory consuming. Then, we present a novel hierarchical sample warping algorithm that generates high-quality point distributions, which match the wavelet representation exactly. One application of the new sampling technique is rendering of objects with measured BRDFs illuminated by complex distant lighting --- our results demonstrate how the new sampling technique is more than an order of magnitude more efficient than the best previous techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15610","fieldValue":"ACM"}
