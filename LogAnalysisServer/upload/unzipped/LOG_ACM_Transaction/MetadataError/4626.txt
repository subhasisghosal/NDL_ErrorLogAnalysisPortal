Drawing on data related to information technology security violations and on a case study created to explain the dynamics observed in that data, the authors constructed a system dynamics model of a theory of the development of insider-threat risks and conducted numerical simulations to explore the parameter and response spaces of the model. By examining several scenarios in which attention to events, increased judging capabilities, better information, and training activities are simulated, the authors theorize about why information technology security effectiveness changes over time. The simulation results argue against the common presumption that increased security comes at the cost of reduced production."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24959","fieldValue":" This article discusses modeling and detection properties associated with the stochastic behavior of Random Constant Scanning (RCS) worms. Although these worms propagate by randomly scanning network addresses to find hosts that are susceptible to infection, traditional RCS worm models are fundamentally deterministic. A density-dependent Markov jump process model for RCS worms is presented and analyzed herein. Conditions are shown for when some stochastic properties of RCS worm propagation can be ignored and when deterministic RCS worm models can be used. A computationally simple hybrid deterministic\/stochastic point-process model for locally observed scanning behavior due to the global propagation of an RCS scanning worm epidemic is presented. An optimal hypothesis-testing approach is presented to detect epidemics of these under idealized conditions based on the cumulative sums of log-likelihood ratios using the hybrid RCS worm model. This article presents in a mathematically rigorous fashion why detection techniques that are only based on passively monitoring local IP addresses cannot quickly detect the global propagation of an RCS worm epidemic with a low false alarm rate, even under idealized conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24959","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24959","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24960","fieldValue":" This article describes a framework for generation and simulation of surrounding vehicles in a driving simulator. The proposed framework generates a traffic stream, corresponding to a given target flow and simulates realistic interactions between vehicles. The framework is based on an approach in which only a limited area around the driving simulator vehicle is simulated. This closest neighborhood is divided into one inner area and two outer areas. Vehicles in the inner area are simulated according to a microscopic simulation model including advanced submodels for driving behavior while vehicles in the outer areas are updated according to a less time-consuming mesoscopic simulation model. The presented work includes a new framework for generating and simulating vehicles within a moving area. It also includes the development of an enhanced model for overtakings and a simple mesoscopic traffic model. The framework has been validated on the number of vehicles that catch up with the driving simulator vehicle and vice versa. The agreement is good for active and passive catch-ups on rural roads and for passive catch-ups on freeways, but less good for active catch-ups on freeways. The reason for this seems to be deficiencies in the utilized lane-changing model. It has been verified that the framework is able to achieve the target flow and that there is a gain in computational time of using the outer areas. The framework has also been tested within the VTI Driving simulator III."}
