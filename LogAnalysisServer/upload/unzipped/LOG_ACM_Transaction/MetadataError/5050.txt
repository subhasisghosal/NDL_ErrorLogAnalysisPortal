We derive an objective evaluation metric to compare the relative energy efficiencies of candidate functional models using empirical HRTF database measurements and robust estimation techniques. Among four sets of closed-form orthonormal functions the complex exponentials are identified as the most efficient to represent the frequency-portion in the spherical harmonics-based HRTF functional model. The proposed model is evaluated across three HRTF data sets: 1) CIPIC database, 2) the MIT KEMAR (Knowles Electronics Mannequin for Acoustics Research) database, and 3) the ANU KEMAR database."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3790","fieldValue":"Empirical determination of frequency representation in spherical harmonics-based HRTF functional modeling"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3790","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3790","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3791","fieldValue":"Feng, Zu-Ren"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3791","fieldValue":"Yang, Xue-Wen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3791","fieldValue":" This paper deals with acoustic event detection (AED), such as screams, gunshots, and explosions, in noisy environments. The main aim is to improve the detection performance under adverse conditions with a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A novel filtering method combined with an energy detector is presented. The wavelet packet transform (WPT) is first used for time-frequency representation of the acoustic signals. The proposed filter in the wavelet packet domain then uses a priori knowledge of the target event and an estimate of noise features to selectively suppress the background noise. It is in fact a content-aware band-pass filter which can automatically pass the frequency bands that are more significant in the target than in the noise. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed filtering method is capable of enhancing the target content while suppressing the background noise for signals with a low SNR. A condition to increase the probability of correct detection is also obtained. Experiments have been carried out on a large dataset of acoustic events that are contaminated by different types of environmental noise and white noise with varying SNRs. Results show that the proposed method is more robust and better adapted to noise than ordinary energy detectors, and it can work even with an SNR as low as 15 dB. A practical system for real time processing and multi-target detection is also proposed in this work."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3791","fieldValue":"A target guided subband filter for acoustic event detection in noisy environments using wavelet packets"}
