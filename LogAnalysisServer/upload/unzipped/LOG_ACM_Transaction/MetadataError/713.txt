Partially RunTime-Reconfigurable (PRTR) FPGAs, such as Virtex-2 Pro and Virtex-4 from Xilinx, allow part of the FPGA area to be reconfigured while the remainder continues to operate without interruption, so that HW tasks can be placed and removed dynamically at runtime. We address two problems related to HW task scheduling on PRTR FPGAs: (1) HW\/SW partitioning. Given an application in the form of a task graph with known execution times on the HW (FPGA) and SW (CPU), and known area sizes on the FPGA, find an valid allocation of tasks to either HW or SW and a static schedule with the optimization objective of minimizing the total schedule length (makespan). (2) Pipelined scheduling. Given an input task graph, construct a pipelined schedule on a PRTR FPGA with the goal of maximizing system throughput while meeting a given end-to-end deadline. Both problems are NP-hard. Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is an extension to SAT by adding the ability to handle arithmetic and other decidable theories. We use the SMT solver Yices with Linear Integer Arithmetic (LIA) theory as the optimization engine for solving the two scheduling problems. In addition, we present an efficient heuristic algorithm based on kernel recognition for the pipelined scheduling problem, a technique borrowed from SW pipelining, to overcome the scalability problem of the SMT-based optimal solution technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13173","fieldValue":"Cheung, Peter Y K"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13173","fieldValue":" We present the GroundHog 2009 benchmarking suite that evaluates the power consumption of reconfigurable technology for applications targeting the mobile computing domain. This benchmark suite includes seven designs; one design targets fine-grained FPGA fabrics allowing for quick state-of-the-art evaluation, and six designs are specified at a high level allowing them to target a range of existing and future reconfigurable technologies. Each of the six designs can be stimulated with the help of synthetically generated input stimuli created by an open-source tool included in the downloadable suite. Another tool is included to help verify the correctness of each implemented design. To demonstrate the potential of this benchmark suite, we evaluate the power consumption of two modern industrial FPGAs targeting the mobile domain. Also, we show how an academic FPGA framework, VPR 5.0, that has been updated for power estimates can be used to estimates the power consumption of different FPGA architectures and an open-source CAD flow mapping to these architectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13174","fieldValue":" Overheating of computer chips leads to degradation of performance and reliability. Therefore, preventing chips from overheating in spite of increased performance requirements has emerged as a major challenge. Since the cost of cooling has been rising steadily, various architecture and application design techniques are used to prevent chip overheating. Temperature-aware task scheduling has emerged as an important application design methodology for addressing this problem in multiprocessor SoC systems. In this work we present the formulation and implementation of a method for analyzing the thermal (chip heating) behavior of a MPSoC task schedule, during the early stages of the design. We highlight the challenges in developing such a framework and propose solutions for tackling them. Due to nondeterminism in task execution times and decision branches, multiprocessor applications cannot be evaluated accurately by the current state-of-the-art thermal simulation and steady-state analysis methods. Hence an analysis covering nondeterministic execution behaviors is required for thermal analysis of MPSoC task schedules. To address this issue we propose a model checking-based approach for solving the thermal analysis problem and formulate it as a hybrid automata reachability verification problem. We present an algorithm for constructing this hybrid automata given the task schedule, a set of power profiles of tasks, and the Compact Thermal Model (CTM) of the chip. Information about task power consumption is inferred from Markov chains which are learned from power profiles of tasks, obtained from simulation or emulation runs. A numerical analysis-based algorithm which uses CounterExample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) is developed for reachability analysis of this hybrid automata. We propose a directed simulation methodology which uses results of a time-bounded analysis of the hybrid automata modeling thermal behavior of the application, to simulate the expected worst-case execution runs of the same. The algorithms presented in this work have been implemented in a prototype tool called HeatCheck. We present experimental results and analysis of thermal behavior of a set of task schedules executing on a MPSoC system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13174","fieldValue":"ACM"}
