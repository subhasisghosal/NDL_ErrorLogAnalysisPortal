This research introduces two-directional communication of an interactive graphical user interface on a universal remote control (URC). It is different from current URCs where users must often spend huge amounts of time setting the command codes and encoding each device. With the increase in the number of appliances that the controller needs to manage and the complicated and numerous control buttons, using such controllers often causes difficulties for users. This research employs a cross-platform with integration theories, so when a user wants to connect an appliance, both the appliance end and the controller end will build a two-directional connection through pairing over Radio Frequency for Consumer Electronics (RF4CE). After connection, the system will automatically set the communication protocol between the controller and the device. The appliance will automatically transmit its current state and service in the form of bundles to the controller, then the controller will project it onto an LCD screen. The controller can also show the number of appliances connected to the current position of the user, allowing the user to use one controller to control all home appliances with ease, achieving a simplified and instinctive control interface to build the integrated control environment for commercial appliances."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6626","fieldValue":"A RF4CE-based remote controller with interactive graphical user interface applied to home automation system"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6627","fieldValue":" A participatory mobile sensing system is designed to enable clients to voluntarily collect environmental data using embedded sensors and a mobile device while going about their daily activities. Due to the spatio-temporal nature of the data, and the significant benefits of the data to the general public, it is necessary to employ an efficient and effective query processing model for the mobile clients to access the data that can be visualized via an interactive multimedia interface. This article introduces a unified on-demand and data broadcast model to serve queries in the context of a mobile sensing system. The contributions of this article include the following: (i) it presents a novel data structure and indexing method to support the system; (ii) it provides flexibility for the client to issue query using on-demand or broadcast channel according to the server load and broadcast schedule; (iii) it enables new data access and processing for the mobile client; and (iv) it is designed for a multiple channels\/receivers environment in a 4G wireless network. The proposed model uses a holistic query processing approach for the mobile sensing system that offers substantial efficiency and autonomy for mobile clients when retrieving data. The results of the experiments undertaken affirm the effectiveness of its performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6627","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6627","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6147","fieldValue":"Issue 1s(Special section on ESTIMedia'12, LCTES'11, rigorous embedded systems design, and multiprocessor system-on-chip for cyber-physical systems), March 2013"}
