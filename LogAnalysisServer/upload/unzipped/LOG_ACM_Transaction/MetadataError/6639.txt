{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7676","fieldValue":" A vector autoregressive model in discrete time domain (DVAR) is often used to analyze continuous time, multivariate, linear Markov systems through their observed time series data sampled at discrete timesteps. Based on previous studies, the DVAR model is supposed to be a noncanonical representation of the system, that is, it does not correspond to a unique system bijectively. However, in this article, we characterize the relations of the DVAR model with its corresponding Structural Vector AR (SVAR) and Continuous Time Vector AR (CTVAR) models through a finite difference method across continuous and discrete time domain. We further clarify that the DVAR model of a continuous time, multivariate, linear Markov system is canonical under a highly generic condition. Our analysis shows that we can uniquely reproduce its SVAR and CTVAR models from the DVAR model. Based on these results, we propose a novel Continuous and Structural Vector Autoregressive (CSVAR) modeling approach to derive the SVAR and the CTVAR models from their DVAR model empirically derived from the observed time series of continuous time linear Markov systems. We demonstrate its superior performance through some numerical experiments on both artificial and real-world data."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7676","fieldValue":"A Novel Continuous and Structural VAR Modeling Approach and Its Application to Reactor Noise Analysis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7677","fieldValue":" Communication networks are complex systems whose operation relies on a large number of components that work together to provide services to end users. As the quality of these services depends on different parameters, understanding how each of them impacts the final performance of a service is a challenging but important problem. However, intervening on individual factors to evaluate the impact of the different parameters is often impractical due to the high cost of intervention in a network. It is, therefore, desirable to adopt a formal approach to understand the role of the different parameters and to predict how a change in any of these parameters will impact performance. The approach of causality pioneered by J. Pearl provides a powerful framework to investigate these questions. Most of the existing theory is non-parametric and does not make any assumption on the nature of the system under study. However, most of the implementations of causal model inference algorithms and most of the examples of usage of a causal model to predict intervention rely on assumptions such linearity, normality, or discrete data. In this article, we present a methodology to overcome the challenges of working with real-world data and extend the application of causality to complex systems in the area of telecommunication networks, for which assumptions of normality, linearity and discrete data do no hold. Specifically, we study the performance of TCP, which is the prevalent protocol for reliable end-to-end transfer in the Internet. Analytical models of the performance of TCP exist, but they take into account the state of network only and disregard the impact of the application at the sender and the receiver, which often influences TCP performance. To address this point, we take as application the file transfer protocol (FTP), which uses TCP for reliable transfer. Studying a well-understood protocol such as TCP allows us to validate our approach and compare its results to previous studies. We first present and evaluate our methodology using TCP traffic obtained via network emulation, which allows us to experimentally validate the prediction of an intervention. We then apply the methodology to real-world TCP traffic sent over the Internet. Throughout the article, we compare the causal approach for studying TCP performance to other approaches such as analytical modeling or simulation and and show how they can complement each other."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7677","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7677","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7677","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7678","fieldValue":" Compared to constraint-based causal discovery, causal discovery based on functional causal models is able to identify the whole causal model under appropriate assumptions [Shimizu et al. 2006; Hoyer et al. 2009; Zhang and Hyv√§rinen 2009b]. Functional causal models represent the effect as a function of the direct causes together with an independent noise term. Examples include the linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM), nonlinear additive noise model, and post-nonlinear (PNL) model. Currently, there are two ways to estimate the parameters in the models: dependence minimization and maximum likelihood. In this article, we show that for any acyclic functional causal model, minimizing the mutual information between the hypothetical cause and the noise term is equivalent to maximizing the data likelihood with a flexible model for the distribution of the noise term. We then focus on estimation of the PNL causal model and propose to estimate it with the warped Gaussian process with the noise modeled by the mixture of Gaussians. As a Bayesian nonparametric approach, it outperforms the previous one based on mutual information minimization with nonlinear functions represented by multilayer perceptrons; we also show that unlike the ordinary regression, estimation results of the PNL causal model are sensitive to the assumption on the noise distribution. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical claims."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7678","fieldValue":"On Estimation of Functional Causal Models: General Results and Application to the Post-Nonlinear Causal Model"}
