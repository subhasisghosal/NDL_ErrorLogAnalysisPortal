These processes include hybridization, lateral gene transfer, and recombination. Despite the existence of reticulation, such events are relatively rare and so a fundamental problem for biologists is the following: given a collection of rooted binary phylogenetic trees on sets of species that correctly represent the tree-like evolution of different parts of their genomes, what is the smallest number of \"reticulation\" vertices in any network that explains the evolution of the species under consideration. It has been previously shown that this problem is NP-hard even when the collection consists of only two rooted binary phylogenetic trees. However, in this paper, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable in the two-tree instance, when parameterized by this smallest number of reticulation vertices."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4309","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4309","fieldValue":"Rooted phylogenetic tree, reticulate evolution, hybridization network, agreement forest, subtree prune and regraft"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4310","fieldValue":" Microarray gene expression data usually consist of a large amount of genes. Among these genes, only a small fraction is informative for performing cancer diagnostic test. This paper focuses on effective identification of informative genes. We analyze gene selection models from the perspective of optimization theory. As a result, a new strategy is designed to modify conventional search engines. Also, as overfitting is likely to occur in microarray data because of their small sample set, a point injection technique is developed to address the problem of overfitting. The proposed strategies have been evaluated on three kinds of cancer diagnosis. Our results show that the proposed strategies can improve the performance of gene selection substantially. The experimental results also indicate that the proposed methods are very robust under all the investigated cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4310","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
