Software-only error detection approaches that exploit program invariants for silent error detection incur large execution overheads and are unreliable as state can be corrupted after invariant checkpoints. In this article, we explore the use of configurable hardware structures for the continuous evaluation of high-level program invariants at the assembly level. We evaluate the resource requirements and performance of the proposed predicate-evaluation hardware structures when integrated with a 32-bit MIPS soft core on a contemporary reconfigurable hardware device. The results, for a small set of kernel codes, reveal that these hardware structures require a very small number of hardware resources with negligible impact on the processor core that they are integrated in. Moreover, the amount of resources is fairly insensitive to the complexity of the invariants, thus making the proposed structures an attractive alternative to software-only predicate checking."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21919","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21920","fieldValue":"Bouganis, Christos-Savvas"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21920","fieldValue":" Clustering large numbers of data points is a very computationally demanding task that often needs to be accelerated in order to be useful in practical applications. This work focuses on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, which is one of the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, and targets its acceleration using an FPGA device. The article presents an optimized, scalable, and parameterizable architecture that takes advantage of the internal memory structure of modern FPGAs in order to deliver a high-performance clustering system. Post-synthesis simulation results show that the developed system can obtain mean speedups of 31Ã\u2014 in real-world tests and 202Ã\u2014 in synthetic tests when compared to state-of-the-art software counterparts running on a quad-core 3.4GHz Intel i7-2600k. Additionally, this implementation is also capable of clustering data with any number of dimensions without impacting the performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21920","fieldValue":"DBSCAN"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21920","fieldValue":"FPGA"}
