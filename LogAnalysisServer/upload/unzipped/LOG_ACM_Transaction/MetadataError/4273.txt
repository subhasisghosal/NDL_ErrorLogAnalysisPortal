Our infrastructure is based on two physical primitives, namely collaborative jamming and spatial signature enforcement, and a zero knowledge alternative for bootstrapping trust. Notably, it eschews the use of shared secrets, while providing a cryptosystem that is no less secure than conventional cryptosystems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3317","fieldValue":" We examined graphical representations of aircraft altitude in simulated air traffic control (ATC) displays. In two experiments, size and contrast cues correlated with altitude improved participants' ability to detect future aircraft collisions (conflicts). Experiment 1 demonstrated that, across several set sizes, contrast and size cues to altitude improved accuracy at identifying conflicts. Experiment 2 demonstrated that graphical cues for representing altitude both improved accuracy and reduced search time for finding conflicts in large set size displays. The addition of size and contrast cues to ATC displays may offer specific benefits in aircraft conflict detection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3317","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3317","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23857","fieldValue":" The contents of many valuable Web-accessible databases are only available through search interfaces and are hence invisible to traditional Web \"crawlers.\" Recently, commercial Web sites have started to manually organize Web-accessible databases into Yahoo!-like hierarchical classification schemes. Here we introduce QProber, a modular system that automates this classification process by using a small number of query probes, generated by document classifiers. QProber can use a variety of types of classifiers to generate the probes. To classify a database, QProber does not retrieve or inspect any documents or pages from the database, but rather just exploits the number of matches that each query probe generates at the database in question. We have conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of QProber over collections of real documents, experimenting with different types of document classifiers and retrieval models. We have also tested our system with over one hundred Web-accessible databases. Our experiments show that our system has low overhead and achieves high classification accuracy across a variety of databases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23857","fieldValue":"ACM"}
