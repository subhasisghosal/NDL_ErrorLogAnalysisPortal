In this article, we present a similar unified framework for interpolatory subdivision schemes. We first decompose the 2n-point interpolatory curve subdivision scheme into repeated local operations. By extending the repeated local operations to quadrilateral meshes, an efficient algorithm can be further derived for interpolatory surface subdivision. Depending on the number n of repeated local operations, the continuity of the limit curve or surface can be of an arbitrary order $C^L, except in the surface case at a limited number of extraordinary vertices where C1$ continuity with bounded curvature is obtained. Boundary rules built upon repeated local operations are also presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16931","fieldValue":" Cage-based deformation has been one of the main approaches for mesh deformation in recent years, with a lot of interesting and active research. The main advantages of cage-based deformation techniques are their simplicity, relative flexibility, and speed. However, to date there has been no widely accepted solution that provides both user control at different levels of detail and high-quality deformations. We present &ast;Cages (star-cages), a significant step forward with respect to traditional single-cage coordinate systems, and which allows the usage of multiple cages enclosing the model for easier manipulation while still preserving the smoothness of the mesh in the transitions between them. The proposed deformation scheme is extremely flexible and versatile, allowing the usage of heterogeneous sets of coordinates and different levels of deformation, ranging from a whole-model deformation to a very localized one. This locality allows faster evaluation and a reduced memory footprint, and as a result outperforms single-cage approaches in flexibility, speed, and memory requirements for complex editing operations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16931","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16931","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16932","fieldValue":" In this article we revisit the problem of blue noise sampling with a strong focus on the spectral properties of the sampling patterns. Starting from the observation that oscillations in the power spectrum of a sampling pattern can cause aliasing artifacts in the resulting images, we synthesize two new types of blue noise patterns: step blue noise with a power spectrum in the form of a step function and single-peak blue noise with a wide zero-region and no oscillations except for a single peak. We study the mathematical relationship of the radial power spectrum to a spatial statistic known as the radial distribution function to determine which power spectra can actually be realized and to construct the corresponding point sets. Finally, we show that both proposed sampling patterns effectively prevent structured aliasing at low sampling rates and perform well at high sampling rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16932","fieldValue":"ACM"}
