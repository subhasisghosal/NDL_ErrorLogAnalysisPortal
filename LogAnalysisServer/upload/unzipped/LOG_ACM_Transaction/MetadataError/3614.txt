{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21735","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a new technique for optimizing loops that contain kernels mapped on a reconfigurable fabric. We assume the Molen machine organization as our framework. We propose combining loop unrolling with loop shifting, which is used to relocate the function calls contained in the loop body such that in every iteration of the transformed loop, software functions (running on GPP) execute in parallel with multiple instances of the kernel (running on FPGA). The algorithm computes the optimal unroll factor and determines the most appropriate transformation (which can be the combination of unrolling plus shifting or either of the two). This method is based on profiling information about the kernelâ\u20AC™s execution times on GPP and FPGA, memory transfers and area utilization. In the experimental part, we apply this method to several kernels from loop nests extracted from real-life applications (DCT and SAD from MPEG2 encoder, Quantizer from JPEG, and Sobelâ\u20AC™s Convolution) and perform an analysis of the results, comparing them with the theoretical maximum speedup by Amdahlâ\u20AC™s Law and showing when and how our transformations are beneficial."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21735","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21735","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21736","fieldValue":"Underwood, Keith D"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21736","fieldValue":"Hemmert, K Scott"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21736","fieldValue":"Ulmer, Craig D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21736","fieldValue":" The field of high performance computing (HPC) currently abounds with excitement about the potential of a broad class of things called accelerators. And, yet, few accelerator based systems are being deployed in general purpose HPC environments. Why is that? This article explores the challenges that accelerators face in the HPC world, with a specific focus on FPGA based systems. We begin with an overview of the characteristics and challenges of typical HPC systems and applications and discuss why FPGAs have the potential to have a significant impact. The bulk of the article is focused on twelve specific areas where FPGA researchers can make contributions to hasten the adoption of FPGAs in HPC environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21736","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21736","fieldValue":"HPC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21736","fieldValue":"ACM"}
