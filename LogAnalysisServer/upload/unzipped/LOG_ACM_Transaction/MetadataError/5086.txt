In this paper, we propose a method for parametric modeling of the phase spectrum, and discuss its applications in speech signal processing. The phase spectrum is modeled as the response of an allpass (AP) filter, whose coefficients are estimated from the knowledge of speech production process, especially the impulse-like nature of excitation source. A signal retaining only the phase spectral component of speech signal is derived by suppressing the magnitude spectral component, and is modeled as the output of an AP filter excited with a sequence of impulses. Entropy of energy of the input signal is minimized to estimate the coefficients of the AP filter. The resulting objective function, being nonconvex in nature, is minimized using particle swarm optimization. The group delay response of estimated AP filters can be used for accurate analysis of resonances of the vocal-tract system (VTS). The error signal associated with AP modeling provides unambiguous evidence about the instants of significant excitation of the VTS. The applications of the proposed AP modeling include, but not limited to, formant tracking, extraction of glottal closure instants, speaker verification and speech synthesis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3876","fieldValue":" Besides noise reduction, an important objective of binaural speech enhancement algorithms is the preservation of the binaural cues of all sound sources. For the desired speech source and the interfering sources, e.g., competing speakers, this can be achieved by preserving their relative transfer functions (RTFs). It has been shown that the binaural multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF) preserves the RTF of the desired speech source, but typically distorts the RTF of the interfering sources. To this end, in this paper we propose two extensions of the binaural MWF, i.e., the binaural MWF with RTF preservation (MWF-RTF) aiming to preserve the RTF of the interfering source and the binaural MWF with interference rejection (MWF-IR) aiming to completely suppress the interfering source. Analytical expressions for the performance of the binaural MWF, MWF-RTF and MWF-IR in terms of noise reduction, speech distortion and binaural cue preservation are derived, showing that the proposed extensions yield a better performance in terms of the signal-to-interference ratio and preservation of the binaural cues of the directional interference, while the overall noise reduction performance is degraded compared to the binaural MWF. Simulation results using binaural behind-the-ear impulse responses measured in a reverberant environment validate the derived analytical expressions for the theoretically achievable performance of the binaural MWF, MWF-RTF, and MWF-IR, showing that the performance highly depends on the position of the interfering source and the number of microphones. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the MWF-RTF yields a very similar overall noise reduction performance as the binaural MWF, while preserving the binaural cues of both the speech and the interfering source."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3876","fieldValue":"Theoretical analysis of linearly constrained multi-channel wiener filtering algorithms for combined noise reduction and binaural cue preservation in binaural hearing aids"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3876","fieldValue":"ACM"}
