We develop distributed algorithms for in-network tracking and range queries for aggregated data (for example, returning the number of targets within any user given region). Our scheme stores the target detection information locally in the network and answers a query by examining the perimeter of the given range. The cost of updating data about mobile targets is proportional to the target displacement. The key insight is to maintain in the sensor network a function with respect to the target detection data on the graph edges that is a differential form such that the integral of this form along any closed curve C gives the integral within the region bounded by C. The differential form has great flexibility, making it appropriate for tracking mobile targets. The basic range query can be used to find a nearby target or any given identifiable target with cost O(d), where d is the distance to the target in question. Dynamic insertion, deletion, coverage holes, and mobility of sensor nodes can be handled with only local operations, making the scheme suitable for a highly dynamic network. It is extremely robust and capable of tolerating errors in sensing and target localization. Targets do not need to be identified for the tracking, thus user privacy can be preserved. In this paper, we only elaborate the advantages of differential forms in tracking of mobile targets. Similar routines can be applied for organizing many other types of information--for example, streaming scalar sensor data (such as temperature data field)--to support efficient range queries. We demonstrate through analysis and simulations that this scheme compares favorably to existing schemes that use location services for answering aggregate range queries of target detection data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10487","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10487","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10487","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10488","fieldValue":" Physical-layer cooperation allows leveraging the spatial diversity of wireless channels without requiring multiple antennas on a single device. However, most research in this field focuses on optimizing physical-layer metrics, with little consideration for network-wide and application-specific performance measures. This paper studies cross-layer design techniques for video streaming over cooperative networks. The problem of joint rate control, relay selection, and power allocation is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem, with the objective of maximizing the sum peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of a set of concurrent video sessions. A global optimization algorithm based on the branch and bound framework and on convex relaxation of nonconvex constraints is then proposed to solve the problem. The proposed algorithm can provide a theoretical upper bound on the achievable video quality and is shown to provably converge to the optimal solution. In addition, it is shown that cooperative relaying allows nodes to save energy without leading to a perceivable decrease in video quality. Based on this observation, an uncoordinated, distributed, and localized low-complexity algorithm is designed, for which we derive conditions for convergence to a Nash equlibrium (NE) of relay selection. The distributed algorithm is also shown to achieve performance comparable in practice to the optimal solution."}
