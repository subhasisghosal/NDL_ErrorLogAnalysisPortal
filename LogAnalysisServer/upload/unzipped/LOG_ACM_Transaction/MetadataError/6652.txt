They serve as input for recommendation algorithms, as simulation data, or for evaluation purposes. In the past, public accessible rating datasets were not abundantly available, leaving researchers no choice but to work with old and static datasets like MovieLens and Netflix. More recently, however, emerging trends as social media and smartphones are found to provide rich data sources which can be turned into valuable research datasets. While dataset availability is growing, a structured way for introducing and comparing new datasets is currently still lacking. In this work, we propose a five-step framework to introduce and benchmark new datasets in the recommender systems domain. We illustrate our framework on a new movie rating datasetâ\u20AC\u201Dcalled MovieTweetingsâ\u20AC\u201Dcollected from Twitter. Following our framework, we detail the origin of the dataset, provide basic descriptive statistics, investigate external validity, report the results of a number of reproducible benchmarks, and conclude by discussing some interesting advantages and appropriate research use cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7711","fieldValue":" The primary goal of a recommender system is to generate high quality user-centred recommendations. However, the traditional evaluation methods and metrics were developed before researchers understood all the factors that increase user satisfaction. This study is an introduction to a novel user and item classification framework. It is proposed that this framework should be used during user-centred evaluation of recommender systems and the need for this framework is justified through experiments. User profiles are constructed and matched against other usersâ\u20AC™ profiles to formulate neighbourhoods and generate top-N recommendations. The recommendations are evaluated to measure the success of the process. In conjunction with the framework, a new diversity metric is presented and explained. The accuracy, coverage, and diversity of top-N recommendations is illustrated and discussed for groups of users. It is found that in contradiction to common assumptions, not all users suffer as expected from the data sparsity problem. In fact, the group of users that receive the most accurate recommendations do not belong to the least sparse area of the dataset."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7711","fieldValue":"A Novel Classification Framework for Evaluating Individual and Aggregate Diversity in Top-N Recommendations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7711","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7711","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1700","fieldValue":"OBoyle, Michael F P"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1700","fieldValue":" Register pressure in modern superscalar processors can be reduced by releasing registers early and by copying their contents to cheap back-up storage. This article quantifies the potential benefits of register occupancy reduction and shows that existing hardware-based schemes typically achieve only a small fraction of this potential. This is because they are unable to accurately determine the last use of a register and must wait until the redefining instruction enters the pipeline. On the other hand, compilers have a global view of the program and, using simple dataflow analysis, can determine the last use. This article evaluates the extent to which compiler analysis can aid early releasing, explores the design space, and introduces commit and issue-based early releasing schemes, quantifying their benefits. Using simple compiler analysis and microarchitecture changes, we achieve 70&percnt; of the potential register file occupancy reduction. By adding more hardware support, we can increase this to 94&percnt;. Our schemes are compared to state-of-the-art approaches for varying register file sizes and are shown to outperform these existing techniques."}
