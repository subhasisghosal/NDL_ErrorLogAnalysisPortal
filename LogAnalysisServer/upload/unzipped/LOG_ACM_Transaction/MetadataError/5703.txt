In this context, important genes refer to the marker genes which change their expression level in correlation with the risk or progression of a disease, or with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment. Gene expression profiling by microarray technology has been successfully applied to classification and diagnostic prediction of cancers. However, extracting these marker genes from a huge set of genes contained by the microarray data set is a major problem. Most of the existing methods for identifying marker genes find a set of genes which may be redundant in nature. Motivated by this, a multiobjective optimization method has been proposed which can find a small set of non-redundant disease related genes providing high sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. In this article, the optimization problem has been modeled as a multiobjective one which is based on the framework of variable length particle swarm optimization. Using some real-life data sets, the performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with that of other state-of-the-art techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5122","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5122","fieldValue":"Identifying non-redundant gene markers from microarray data: a multiobjective variable length PSO-based approach"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5122","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5122","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5123","fieldValue":" Gene translation is the process in which intracellular macro-molecules, called ribosomes, decode genetic information in the mRNA chain into the corresponding proteins. Gene translation includes several steps. During the elongation step, ribosomes move along the mRNA in a sequential manner and link amino-acids together in the corresponding order to produce the proteins. The homogeneous ribosome flow model (HRFM) is a deterministic computational model for translation-elongation under the assumption of constant elongation rates along the mRNA chain. The HRFM is described by a set of n first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations, where n represents the number of sites along the mRNA chain. The HRFM also includes two positive parameters: ribosomal initiation rate and the (constant) elongation rate. In this paper, we show that the steady-state translation rate in the HRFM is a concave function of its parameters. This means that the problem of determining the parameter values that maximize the translation rate is relatively simple. Our results may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms and evolution of translation-elongation. We demonstrate this by using the theoretical results to estimate the initiation rate in M. musculus embryonic stem cell. The underlying assumption is that evolution optimized the translation mechanism. For the infinite-dimensional HRFM, we derive a closed-form solution to the problem of determining the initiation and transition rates that maximize the protein translation rate. We show that these expressions provide good approximations for the optimal values in the n-dimensional HRFM already for relatively small values of n. These results may have applications for synthetic biology where an important problem is to re-engineer genomic systems in order to maximize the protein production rate."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5123","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5123","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5123","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5124","fieldValue":" During previous years, many studies on synthesis, as well as on anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activities of the pyrazole derivatives have been described. Certain pyrazole derivatives exhibit important pharmacological activities and have proved to be useful template in drug research. Considering importance of pyrazole template, in current work the series of novel inhibitors were designed by replacing central ring of acridine with pyrazole ring. These heterocyclic compounds were proposed as a new potential base for telomerase inhibitors. Obtained dibenzopyrrole structure was used as a novel scaffold structure and extension of inhibitors was done by different functional groups. Docking of newly designed compounds in the telomerase active site (telomerase catalytic subunit TERT) was carried out. All dibenzopyrrole derivatives were evaluated by three docking programs: CDOCKER, Ligandfit docking (Scoring Functions) and AutoDock. Compound C_9g, C_9k and C_9l performed best in comparison to all designed inhibitors during the docking in all methods and in interaction analysis. Introduction of pyrazole and extension of dibenzopyrrole in compounds confirm that such compound may act as potential telomerase inhibitors."}
