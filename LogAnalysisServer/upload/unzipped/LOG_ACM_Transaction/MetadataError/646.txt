We propose a temporal logic called Ana CTL (computational tree logic for analog circuit verification) which is suitable for specifying properties specific to analog circuits. The application of Ana CTL for validation of transient behavior of arbitrarily nonlinear analog circuits is presented. The transient response of a circuit under all possible input waveforms is represented as a finite state machine (FSM), by bounding and discretizing the continuous state space of an analog circuit. We have developed algorithms to run Ana CTL queries on this discretized model using search-based methods which reduce the runtime considerably by avoiding creation of the whole FSM. The application of these methods on several real-life analog circuits is presented and we show that this system is a useful aid for detecting and debugging early design errors. We also present methods for checking the equivalence of transient response of two analog circuits. The behavior of two different analog circuits can rarely be exactly similar. Hence, we introduce a notion of approximate equivalence. A query language for checking different notions of user-definable approximate equivalence is presented which extends the syntax of the Ana CTL model checking language. In its extended form, Ana CTL can be used combining model checking with equivalence checking."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13015","fieldValue":"Chang, Kai-Hui"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13015","fieldValue":" We propose two new algorithms for rewiring: a postplacement optimization that reconnects pins of a given netlist without changing the logic function and gate locations. In the first algorithm, we extract small subcircuits consisting of several gates from the design and reconnect pins according to the symmetries of the subcircuits. To enhance the power of symmetry detection, we also propose a graph-based symmetry detector that can identify permutational and phase-shift symmetries on multiple input and output wires, as well as hybrid symmetries, creating abundant opportunities for rewiring. Our second algorithm, called long-range rewiring, is based on reconnecting equivalent pins and can augment the first approach for further optimization. We apply our techniques for wirelength optimization and observe that they provide wirelength reduction comparable to that achieved by detailed placement."}
