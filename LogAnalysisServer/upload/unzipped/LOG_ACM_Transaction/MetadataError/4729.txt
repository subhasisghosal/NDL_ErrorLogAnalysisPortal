Based on multidimensional model, OLAP commercial environments such as they are currently designed in traditional applications are used to provide means for the analysis of facts that are depicted by numeric data (e.g., sales depicted by amount or quantity sold). However, in numerous fields, like in medical or bioinformatics, multimedia data are used as valuable information in the decisional process. One of the problems when integrating multimedia data as facts in a multidimensional model is to deal with dimensions built on descriptors that can be obtained by various computation modes on raw multimedia data. Taking into account these computation modes makes possible the characterization of the data by various points of view depending on the user's profile, his best-practices, his level of expertise, and so on. We propose a new multidimensional model that integrates functional dimension versions allowing the descriptors of the multidimensional data to be computed by different functions. With this approach, the user is able to obtain and choose multiple points of view on the data he analyses. This model is used to develop an OLAP application for navigation into a hypercube integrating various functional dimension versions for the calculus of descriptors in a medical use case."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25261","fieldValue":"OLAP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25261","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25261","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25262","fieldValue":" Haptic perception refers to the ability of human beings to perceive spatial properties through touch-based sensations. In haptics, contextual clues about material,shape, size, texture, and weight configurations of an object are perceived by individuals leading to recognition of the object and its spatial features. In this paper, we present strategies and algorithms to model context in haptic applications that allow users to haptically explore objects in virtual reality\/augmented reality environments. Initial results show significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency of haptic perception in augmented reality environments when compared to conventional approaches that do not model context in haptic rendering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25262","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25262","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25263","fieldValue":" This article presents the results of a study that explored the human side of the multimedia experience. We propose a model that assesses quality variation from three distinct levels: the network, the media and the content levels; and from two views: the technical and the user perspective. By facilitating parameter variation at each of the quality levels and from each of the perspectives, we were able to examine their impact on user quality perception. Results show that a significant reduction in frame rate does not proportionally reduce the user's understanding of the presentation independent of technical parameters, that multimedia content type significantly impacts user information assimilation, user level of enjoyment, and user perception of quality, and that the device display type impacts user information assimilation and user perception of quality. Finally, to ensure the transfer of information, low-level abstraction (network-level) parameters, such as delay and jitter, should be adapted; to maintain the user's level of enjoyment, high-level abstraction quality parameters (content-level), such as the appropriate use of display screens, should be adapted."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25263","fieldValue":"ACM"}
