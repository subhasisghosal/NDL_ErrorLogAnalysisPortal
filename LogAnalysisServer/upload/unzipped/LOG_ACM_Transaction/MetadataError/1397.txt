Unlike a homogeneous texture, a progressively-variant texture can model local texture variations, including the scale, orientation, color, and shape variations of texture elements. We describe techniques for modeling progressively-variant textures in 2D as well as for synthesizing them over surfaces. For 2D texture modeling, our feature-based warping technique allows the user to control the shape variations of texture elements, making it possible to capture complex texture variations such as those seen in animal coat patterns. In addition, our feature-based blending technique can create a smooth transition between two given homogeneous textures, with progressive changes of both shapes and colors of texture elements. For synthesizing textures over surfaces, the biggest challenge is that the synthesized texture elements tend to break apart as they progressively vary. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm based on texton masks, which mark most prominent texture elements in the 2D texture sample. By leveraging the power of texton masks, our algorithm can maintain the integrity of the synthesized texture elements on the target surface."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15302","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15302","fieldValue":" We present a new method for completing missing parts caused by the removal of foreground or background elements from an image. Our goal is to synthesize a complete, visually plausible and coherent image. The visible parts of the image serve as a training set to infer the unknown parts. Our method iteratively approximates the unknown regions and composites adaptive image fragments into the image. Values of an inverse matte are used to compute a confidence map and a level set that direct an incremental traversal within the unknown area from high to low confidence. In each step, guided by a fast smooth approximation, an image fragment is selected from the most similar and frequent examples. As the selected fragments are composited, their likelihood increases along with the mean confidence of the image, until reaching a complete image. We demonstrate our method by completion of photographs and paintings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15303","fieldValue":" Using generic interpolation machinery based on solving Poisson equations, a variety of novel tools are introduced for seamless editing of image regions. The first set of tools permits the seamless importation of both opaque and transparent source image regions into a destination region. The second set is based on similar mathematical ideas and allows the user to modify the appearance of the image seamlessly, within a selected region. These changes can be arranged to affect the texture, the illumination, and the color of objects lying in the region, or to make tileable a rectangular selection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15303","fieldValue":"ACM"}
