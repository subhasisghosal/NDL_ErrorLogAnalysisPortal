In this work, we present an intuitive and easy-to-implement method based on ranked neighborhood comparisons that detects structure in unsupervised data. The method is based on ordering objects in terms of similarity and on the mutual overlap of nearest neighbors. This basic framework was originally introduced in the field of social network analysis to detect actor communities. We demonstrate that the same ideas can successfully be applied to biomedical data sets in order to reveal complex underlying structure. The algorithm is very efficient and works on distance data directly without requiring a vectorial embedding of data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the validity of this approach. Comparisons with state-of-the-art clustering methods show that the presented method outperforms hierarchical methods as well as density based clustering methods and model-based clustering. A further advantage of the method is that it simultaneously provides a visualization of the data. Especially in biomedical applications, the visualization of data can be used as a first pre-processing step when analyzing real world data sets to get an intuition of the underlying data structure. We apply this model to synthetic data as well as to various biomedical data sets which demonstrate the high quality and usefulness of the inferred structure."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5202","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5203","fieldValue":" The International Conference on Genome Informatics, known as \"GIW\", is one of the longest running annual conferences in bioinformatics or computational biology. GIW has played an important role in the development of the bioinformatics community in the Asia-Pacific region since its establishment in 1990. The first GIW was held as a Japanese workshop (called the Genome Informatics Workshop) in Tokyo, Japan, in 1990. It has been held annually since then, switching from a domestic conference to an international one in 1993 and updating its official name to the current \"International Conference on Genome Informatics\" in 2001. GIW was held in Japan (Tokyo or Yokohama) until 2006, but since then GIW has been held in various locations in the Asia-Pacific region. The 18th GIW was held in Singapore in 2007. In the following years, GIW was held in Gold Coast, Australia (2008); Yokohama, Japan (2009); Hangzhou, China (2010); Busan, Korea (2011); Tainan, Taiwan (2012); and again in Singapore in 2013. With its long history and track record in attracting state-of-the art bioinformatics research in general, and especially algorithmic work, GIW is arguably not only the top bioinformatics conference in the Asia-Pacific region, but also one of the most important worldwide. Now solidly established as an international conference, GIW will be revisiting its birthplace, Tokyo, for 2014 and 2015."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5203","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5203","fieldValue":"ACM"}
