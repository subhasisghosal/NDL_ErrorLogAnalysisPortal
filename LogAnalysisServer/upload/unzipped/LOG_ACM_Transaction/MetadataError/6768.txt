To decide which products to produce, manufacturers need to analyze the consumersâ\u20AC™ requirements and how consumers make their purchase decisions so that the new products will be competitive in the market. In this paper, we first present a general distance-based product adoption model to capture consumersâ\u20AC™ purchase behavior. Using this model, various distance metrics can be used to describe different real life purchase behavior. We then provide a learning algorithm to decide which set of distance metrics one should use when we are given some accessible historical purchase data. Based on the product adoption model, we formalize the k most marketable products (or k-MMP) selection problem and formally prove that the problem is NP-hard. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient greedy-based approximation algorithm with a provable solution guarantee. Using submodularity analysis, we prove that our approximation algorithm can achieve at least 63&percnt; of the optimal solution. We apply our algorithm on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets (TripAdvisor.com), and show that our algorithm can easily achieve five or more orders of speedup over the exhaustive search and achieve about 96&percnt; of the optimal solution on average. Our experiments also demonstrate the robustness of our distance metric learning method, and illustrate how one can adopt it to improve the accuracy of product selection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8052","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8052","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8053","fieldValue":" Given a directed graph of millions of nodes, how can we automatically spot anomalous, suspicious nodes judging only from their connectivity patterns? Suspicious graph patterns show up in many applications, from Twitter users who buy fake followers, manipulating the social network, to botnet members performing distributed denial of service attacks, disturbing the network traffic graph. We propose a fast and effective method, CatchSync, which exploits two of the tell-tale signs left in graphs by fraudsters: (a) synchronized behavior: suspicious nodes have extremely similar behavior patterns because they are often required to perform some task together (such as follow the same user); and (b) rare behavior: their connectivity patterns are very different from the majority. We introduce novel measures to quantify both concepts (â\u20ACœsynchronicityâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœnormalityâ\u20AC?) and we propose a parameter-free algorithm that works on the resulting synchronicity-normality plots. Thanks to careful design, CatchSync has the following desirable properties: (a) it is scalable to large datasets, being linear in the graph size; (b) it is parameter free; and (c) it is side-information-oblivious: it can operate using only the topology, without needing labeled data, nor timing information, and the like., while still capable of using side information if available. We applied CatchSync on three large, real datasets, 1-billion-edge Twitter social graph, 3-billion-edge, and 12-billion-edge Tencent Weibo social graphs, and several synthetic ones; CatchSync consistently outperforms existing competitors, both in detection accuracy by 36&percnt; on Twitter and 20&percnt; on Tencent Weibo, as well as in speed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8053","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8053","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8054","fieldValue":" Multi-modal similarity search has attracted considerable attention to meet the need of information retrieval across different types of media. To enable efficient multi-modal similarity search in large-scale databases recently, researchers start to study multi-modal hashing. Most of the existing methods are applied to search across multi-views among which explicit correspondence is provided. Given a multi-modal similarity search task, we observe that abundant multi-view data can be found on the Web which can serve as an auxiliary bridge. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Translated Hashing (HTH) method with such auxiliary bridge incorporated not only to improve current multi-view search but also to enable similarity search across heterogeneous media which have no direct correspondence. HTH provides more flexible and discriminative ability by embedding heterogeneous media into different Hamming spaces, compared to almost all existing methods that map heterogeneous data in a common Hamming space. We formulate a joint optimization model to learn hash functions embedding heterogeneous media into different Hamming spaces, and a translator aligning different Hamming spaces. The extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, one publicly available dataset of Flickr, and the other MIRFLICKR-Yahoo Answers dataset, highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8054","fieldValue":"ACM"}
