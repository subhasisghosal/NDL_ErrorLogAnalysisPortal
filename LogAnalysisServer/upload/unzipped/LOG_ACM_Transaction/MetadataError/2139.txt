We assume that the foreground subject has already been extracted, and focus on the challenging task of generating a video with a new background, such that the new background motion appears compatible with the original one. Failure to match the motion results in disturbing slippage or moonwalk artifacts, where the subject's feet appear to slide or slip over the ground. While matching the motion across the entire frame is impossible for scenes with differing geometry, we aim to match the local motion of the ground in the vicinity of the subject. This is achieved by reordering and warping the available target background frames in a manner that optimizes a suitably designed objective function."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17203","fieldValue":" We present the first real-time method for refinement of depth data using shape-from-shading in general uncontrolled scenes. Per frame, our real-time algorithm takes raw noisy depth data and an aligned RGB image as input, and approximates the time-varying incident lighting, which is then used for geometry refinement. This leads to dramatically enhanced depth maps at 30Hz. Our algorithm makes few scene assumptions, handling arbitrary scene objects even under motion. To enable this type of real-time depth map enhancement, we contribute a new highly parallel algorithm that reformulates the inverse rendering optimization problem in prior work, allowing us to estimate lighting and shape in a temporally coherent way at video frame-rates. Our optimization problem is minimized using a new regular grid Gauss-Newton solver implemented fully on the GPU. We demonstrate results showing enhanced depth maps, which are comparable to offline methods but are computed orders of magnitude faster, as well as baseline comparisons with online filtering-based methods. We conclude with applications of our higher quality depth maps for improved real-time surface reconstruction and performance capture."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17203","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17203","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17204","fieldValue":" Surface reconstruction from point cloud is of great practical importance in computer graphics. Existing methods often realize reconstruction via a few phases with respective goals, whose integration may not give an optimal solution. In this paper, to avoid the inherent limitations of multi-phase processing in the prior art, we propose a unified framework that treats geometry and connectivity construction as one joint optimization problem. The framework is based on dictionary learning in which the dictionary consists of the vertices of the reconstructed triangular mesh and the sparse coding matrix encodes the connectivity of the mesh. The dictionary learning is formulated as a constrained $&ell;_2,q$-optimization (0 < q < 1), aiming to find the vertex position and triangulation that minimize an energy function composed of point-to-mesh metric and regularization. Our formulation takes many factors into account within the same framework, including distance metric, noise\/outlier resilience, sharp feature preservation, no need to estimate normal, etc., thus providing a global and robust algorithm that is able to efficiently recover a piecewise smooth surface from dense data points with imperfections. Extensive experiments using synthetic models, real world models, and publicly available benchmark show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise and outliers, geometric feature and detail preservation, and mesh connectivity."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17204","fieldValue":"<i>l<\/i><sub>2,q<\/sub>-optimization"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17204","fieldValue":"ACM"}
