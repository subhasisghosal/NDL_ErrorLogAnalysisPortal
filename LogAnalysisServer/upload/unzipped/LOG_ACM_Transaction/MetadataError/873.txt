In contrast to conventional cells in battery packs, where all cells are monitored and controlled centrally, each smart cell is equipped with its own electronics in the form of a Cell Management Unit (CMU). The CMU maintains the cell in a safe and healthy operating state, while system-level battery management functions are performed by cooperation of the smart cells via communication. Here, the smart cells collaborate in a self-organizing fashion without a central controller instance. This enables maximum scalability and modularity, significantly simplifying integration of battery packs. However, for this emerging architecture, system-level design methodologies and tools have not been investigated yet. By contrast, components are developed individually and then manually tested in a hardware development platform. Consequently, the systematic design of the hardware\/software architecture of smart cells requires a cyber-physical multi-level co-simulation of the network of smart cells that has to include all the components from the software, electronic, electric, and electrochemical domains. This comprises distributed BMS algorithms running on the CMUs, the communication network, control circuitry, cell balancing hardware, and battery cell behavior. For this purpose, we introduce a CPCSF that enables rapid design and analysis of smart cell hardware\/software architectures. Our framework is then applied to investigate request-driven active cell balancing strategies that make use of the decentralized system architecture. In an exhaustive analysis on a realistic 21.6kW h Electric Vehicle (EV) battery pack containing 96 smart cells in series, the CPCSF is able to simulate hundreds of balancing runs together with all system characteristics, using the proposed request-driven balancing strategies at highest accuracy within an overall time frame of several hours. Consequently, the presented CPCSF for the first time allows us to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the behavior of smart cell architectures for real-world applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13526","fieldValue":" With the advent of globalization in the semiconductor industry, it is necessary to prevent unauthorized usage of third-party IPs (3PIPs), cloning and unwanted modification of 3PIPs, and unauthorized production of ICs. Due to the increasing complexity of ICs, system-on-chip (SoC) designers use various 3PIPs in their design to reduce time-to-market and development costs, which creates a trust issue between the SoC designer and the IP owners. In addition, as the ICs are fabricated around the globe, the SoC designers give fabrication contracts to offshore foundries to manufacture ICs and have little control over the fabrication process, including the total number of chips fabricated. Similarly, the 3PIP owners lack control over the number of fabricated chips and\/or the usage of their IPs in an SoC. Existing research only partially addresses the problems of IP piracy and IC overproduction, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no work that considers IP overuse. In this article, we present a comprehensive solution for preventing IP piracy and IC overproduction by assuring forward trust between all entities involved in the SoC design and fabrication process. We propose a novel design flow to prevent IC overproduction and IP overuse. We use an existing logic encryption technique to obfuscate the netlist of an SoC or a 3PIP and propose a modification to enable manufacturing tests before the activation of chips which is absolutely necessary to prevent overproduction. We have used asymmetric and symmetric key encryption, in a fashion similar to Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), to transfer keys from the SoC designer or 3PIP owners to the chips. In addition, we also propose to attach an IP digest (a cryptographic hash of the entire IP) to the header of an IP to prevent modification of the IP by the SoC designers. We have shown that our approach is resistant to various attacks with the cost of minimal area overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13527","fieldValue":" Power and performance optimization of integrated circuits is performed by timing-driven algorithms that operate on directed acyclic graphs. Sequential circuits and circuits with topological feedback contain cycles. Cyclic circuits must be represented as directed acyclic graphs to be optimized and evaluated using static timing analysis. Algorithms in commercial electronic design automation tools generate the required acyclic graphs by cutting cycles without considering timing paths. This work reports on a method for generating directed acyclic circuit graphs that do not cut the specified timing paths. The algorithm is applied to over 125 benchmark designs and asynchronous handshake controllers. The runtime is less than 1 second, even for even the largest published controllers. Circuit timing graphs generated using this method retain the necessary timing paths, which enables circuit validation and optimization employing the commercial tools. Additional benefits show these designs are on an average a third in size, operate 33.3&percnt; faster, and consume one-fourth the energy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13527","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13527","fieldValue":"ACM"}
