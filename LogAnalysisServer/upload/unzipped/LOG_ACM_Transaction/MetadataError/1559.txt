By looking at the local structure of the coefficient matrix and performing a recursive set of variable eliminations, combined with a simplification of the resulting coarse level problems, we obtain bases better suited for problems with inhomogeneous (spatially varying) data, smoothness, and boundary constraints. Our approach removes the need to heuristically adjust the optimal number of preconditioning levels, significantly outperforms previously proposed approaches, and also maps cleanly onto data-parallel architectures such as modern GPUs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15723","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15723","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15724","fieldValue":" We present novel algorithms to perform collision and distance queries among multiple deformable models in dynamic environments. These include inter-object queries between different objects as well as intra-object queries. We describe a unified approach to compute these queries based on N-body distance computation and use properties of the $2^nd$ order discrete Voronoi diagram to perform N-body culling. Our algorithms involve no preprocessing and also work well on models with changing topologies. We can perform all proximity queries among complex deformable models consisting of thousands of triangles in a fraction of a second on a high-end PC. Moreover, our Voronoi-based culling algorithm can improve the performance of separation distance and penetration queries by an order of magnitude."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15724","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15724","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15725","fieldValue":"Magnenat-Thalmann, Nadia"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15725","fieldValue":" Robust handling of collisions on non-oriented deformable surfaces requires advanced methods for recovering intersecting surfaces. We present a novel method that resolves intersections between two intersecting surface regions by inducing relative displacements which minimize the length of the intersection contour between them. This method, which does not rely on intersection regions, has a broader application field than existing methods, and its implementation is also much simpler, allowing integration into most existing collision response schemes. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method through examples in the context of cloth simulation."}
