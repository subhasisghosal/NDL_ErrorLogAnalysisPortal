Existing methods, however, are insensitive to statistical properties, such as correlations between motions. In addition, they lack the capability to quantitatively evaluate the reliability of synthesized motions. This paper proposes a method that treats motion interpolations as statistical predictions of missing data in an arbitrarily definable parametric space. A practical technique of geostatistics, called universal kriging, is then introduced for statistically estimating the correlations between the dissimilarity of motions and the distance in the parametric space. Our method statistically optimizes interpolation kernels for given parameters at each frame, using a pose distance metric to efficiently analyze the correlation. Motions are accurately predicted for the spatial constraints represented in the parametric space, and they therefore have few undesirable artifacts, if any. This property alleviates the problem of spatial inconsistencies, such as foot-sliding, that are associated with many existing methods. Moreover, numerical estimates for the reliability of predictions enable motions to be adaptively sampled. Since the interpolation kernels are computed with a linear system in real-time, motions can be interactively edited using various spatial controls."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15598","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15598","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15599","fieldValue":" This paper presents a novel physics-based representation of realistic character motion. The dynamical model incorporates several factors of locomotion derived from the biomechanical literature, including relative preferences for using some muscles more than others. elastic mechanisms at joints due to the mechanical properties of tendons, ligaments, and muscles, and variable stiffness at joints depending on the task. When used in a spacetime optimization framework, the parameters of this model define a wide range of styles of natural human movement.Due to the complexity of biological motion, these style parameters are too difficult to design by hand. To address this, we introduce Nonlinear Inverse Optimization, a novel algorithm for estimating optimization parameters from motion capture data. Our method can extract the physical parameters from a single short motion sequence. Once captured, this representation of style is extremely flexible: motions can be generated in the same style but performing different tasks, and styles may be edited to change the physical properties of the body."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15599","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15599","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15600","fieldValue":" Style translation is the process of transforming an input motion into a new style while preserving its original content. This problem is motivated by the needs of interactive applications, which require rapid processing of captured performances. Our solution learns to translate by analyzing differences between performances of the same content in input and output styles. It relies on a novel correspondence algorithm to align motions, and a linear time-invariant model to represent stylistic differences. Once the model is estimated with system identification, our system is capable of translating streaming input with simple linear operations at each frame."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15600","fieldValue":"ACM"}
