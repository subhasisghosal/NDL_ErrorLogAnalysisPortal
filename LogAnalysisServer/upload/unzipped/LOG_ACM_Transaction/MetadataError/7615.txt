The available bandwidth of a link or complete path is expressed in terms of a service curve, which is a function that appears in the network calculus to express the service available to a traffic flow. The service curve is estimated based on measurements of a sequence of probing packets or passive measurements of a sample path of arrivals. It is shown that existing bandwidth estimation methods can be derived in the min-plus algebra of the network calculus, thus providing further mathematical justification for these methods. Principal difficulties of estimating available bandwidth from measurements of network probes are related to potential nonlinearities of the underlying network. When networks are viewed as systems that operate either in a linear or in a nonlinear regime, it is argued that probing schemes extract the most information at a point when the network crosses from a linear to a nonlinear regime. Experiments on the Emulab testbed at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, evaluate the robustness of the system-theoretic interpretation of networks in practice. Multinode experiments evaluate how well the convolution operation of the min-plus algebra provides estimates for the available bandwidth of a path from estimates of individual links."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10039","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10039","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10039","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10040","fieldValue":" The maximum differential backlog (MDB), or \"backpressure\" control policy of Tassiulas and Ephremides has been shown to adaptively maximize the stable throughput of multihop wireless networks with random traffic arrivals and queueing. The practical implementation of the MDB policy in wireless networks with mutually interfering links, however, requires the development of distributed optimization algorithms. Within the context of code-division multiple-access (CDMA)-based multihop wireless networks, we develop a set of node-based scaled gradient projection power control algorithms which solves the MDB optimization problem based on the high-signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) approximation of link capacities using low communication overhead. We investigate the impact of the high-SINR approximation and the nonnegligible convergence time required by the power control algorithms on the throughput region achievable by the iterative MDB policy. We show that the policy can achieve at least the stability region induced by the high-SINR capacity region."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10040","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10040","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10040","fieldValue":"ACM"}
