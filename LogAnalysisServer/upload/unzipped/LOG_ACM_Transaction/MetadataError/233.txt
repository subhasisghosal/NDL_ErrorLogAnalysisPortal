{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11664","fieldValue":" There has been extensive work in many different fields on how phenomena of interest (e.g., diseases, innovation, product adoption) â\u20ACœdiffuseâ\u20AC? through a social network. As social networks increasingly become a fabric of society, there is a need to make â\u20ACœoptimalâ\u20AC? decisions with respect to an observed model of diffusion. For example, in epidemiology, officials want to find a set of k individuals in a social network which, if treated, would minimize spread of a disease. In marketing, campaign managers try to identify a set of k customers that, if given a free sample, would generate maximal â\u20ACœbuzzâ\u20AC? about the product. In this article, we first show that the well-known Generalized Annotated Program (GAP) paradigm can be used to express many existing diffusion models. We then define a class of problems called Social Network Diffusion Optimization Problems (SNDOPs). SNDOPs have four parts: (i) a diffusion model expressed as a GAP, (ii) an objective function we want to optimize with respect to a given diffusion model, (iii) an integer kâ\u20AC\u2030>â\u20AC\u20300 describing resources (e.g., medication) that can be placed at nodes, (iv) a logical condition VC that governs which nodes can have a resource (e.g., only children above the age of 5 can be treated with a given medication). We study the computational complexity of SNDOPs and show both NP-completeness results as well as results on complexity of approximation. We then develop an exact and a heuristic algorithm to solve a large class of SNDOPproblems and show that our GREEDY-SNDOPs algorithm achieves the best possible approximation ratio that a polynomial algorithm can achieve (unless Pâ\u20AC\u2030=â\u20AC\u2030NP). We conclude with a prototype experimental implementation to solve SNDOPs that looks at a real-world Wikipedia dataset consisting of over 103,000 edges."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11664","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11664","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2067","fieldValue":" Hardware Performance Counter-based (HPC) runtime checking is an effective way to identify malicious behaviors of malware and detect malicious modifications to a legitimate programâ\u20AC™s control flow. To reduce the overhead in the monitored system which has limited storage and computing resources, we present a â\u20ACœsample-locally-analyze-remotelyâ\u20AC? technique. The sampled HPC data are sent to a remote server for further analysis. To minimize the I\/O bandwidth required for transmission, the fine-grained HPC profiles are compressed into much smaller vectors with Compressive Sensing. The experimental results demonstrate an 80&percnt; I\/O bandwidth reduction after applying Compressive Sensing, without compromising the detection and identification capabilities."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2067","fieldValue":"Hardware Performance Counter-Based Malware Identification and Detection with Adaptive Compressive Sensing"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11665","fieldValue":" This article investigates under which conditions instantiation-based proof procedures can be combined in a nested way, in order to mechanically construct new instantiation procedures for richer theories.
