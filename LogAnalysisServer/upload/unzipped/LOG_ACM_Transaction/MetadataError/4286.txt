{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23890","fieldValue":" To discover translation knowledge in diverse data resources on the Web, this article proposes an effective approach to finding translation equivalents of query terms and constructing multilingual lexicons through the mining of Web anchor texts and link structures. Although Web anchor texts are wide-scoped hypertext resources, not every particular pair of languages contains sufficient anchor texts for effective extraction of translations for Web queries. For more generalized applications, the approach is designed based on a transitive translation model. The translation equivalents of a query term can be extracted via its translation in an intermediate language. To reduce interference from translation errors, the approach further integrates a competitive linking algorithm into the process of determining the most probable translation. A series of experiments has been conducted, including performance tests on term translation extraction, cross-language information retrieval, and translation suggestions for practical Web search services, respectively. The obtained experimental results have shown that the proposed approach is effective in extracting translations of unknown queries, is easy to combine with the probabilistic retrieval model to improve the cross-language retrieval performance, and is very useful when the considered language pairs lack a sufficient number of anchor texts. Based on the approach, an experimental system called LiveTrans has been developed for English--Chinese cross-language Web search."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23890","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23890","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23891","fieldValue":" Digital libraries (DLs) are complex information systems and therefore demand formal foundations lest development efforts diverge and interoperability suffers. In this article, we propose the fundamental abstractions of Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, and Societies (5S), which allow us to define digital libraries rigorously and usefully. Streams are sequences of arbitrary items used to describe both static and dynamic (e.g., video) content. Structures can be viewed as labeled directed graphs, which impose organization. Spaces are sets with operations on those sets that obey certain constraints. Scenarios consist of sequences of events or actions that modify states of a computation in order to accomplish a functional requirement. Societies are sets of entities and activities and the relationships among them. Together these abstractions provide a formal foundation to define, relate, and unify concepts---among others, of digital objects, metadata, collections, and services---required to formalize and elucidate \"digital libraries\". The applicability, versatility, and unifying power of the 5S model are demonstrated through its use in three distinct applications: building and interpretation of a DL taxonomy, informal and formal analysis of case studies of digital libraries (NDLTD and OAI), and utilization as a formal basis for a DL description language."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23891","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23891","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23892","fieldValue":" XIRQL (\"circle\") is an XML query language that incorporates imprecision and vagueness for both structural and content-oriented query conditions. The corresponding uncertainty is handled by a consistent probabilistic model. The core features of XIRQL are (1) document ranking based on index term weighting, (2) specificity-oriented search for retrieving the most relevant parts of documents, (3) datatypes with vague predicates for dealing with specific types of content and (4) structural vagueness for vague interpretation of structural query conditions. A XIRQL database may contain several classes of documents, where all documents in a class conform to the same DTD; links between documents also are supported. XIRQL queries are translated into a path algebra, which can be processed by our HyREX retrieval engine."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23892","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23892","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23892","fieldValue":"ACM"}
