Once a node's cryptographic key is compromised, an attacker may completely impersonate it and introduce arbitrary false information into the network. Basic cryptographic mechanisms are often not effective in this situation. Most techniques to address this problem focus on detecting and tolerating false information introduced by compromised nodes. They cannot pinpoint exactly where the false information is introduced and who is responsible for it. In this article, we propose an application-independent framework for accurately identifying compromised sensor nodes. The framework provides an appropriate abstraction of application-specific detection mechanisms and models the unique properties of sensor networks. Based on the framework, we develop alert reasoning algorithms to identify compromised nodes. The algorithm assumes that compromised nodes may collude at will. We show that our algorithm is optimal in the sense that it identifies the largest number of compromised nodes without introducing false positives. We evaluate the effectiveness of the designed algorithm through comprehensive experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22244","fieldValue":"Di Pietro, Roberto"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22244","fieldValue":"Mancini, Luigi V"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22244","fieldValue":" We give, for the first time, a precise mathematical analysis of the connectivity and security properties of sensor networks that make use of the random predistribution of keys. We also show how to set the parameters---pool and key ring size---in such a way that the network is not only connected with high probability via secure links but also provably resilient, in the following sense: We formally show that any adversary that captures sensors at random with the aim of compromising a constant fraction of the secure links must capture at least a constant fraction of the nodes of the network. In the context of wireless sensor networks where random predistribution of keys is employed, we are the first to provide a mathematically precise proof, with a clear indication of parameter choice, that two crucial properties---connectivity via secure links and resilience against malicious attacks---can be obtained simultaneously. We also show in a mathematically rigorous way that the network enjoys another strong security property. The adversary cannot partition the network into two linear size components, compromising all the links between them, unless it captures linearly many nodes. This implies that the network is also fault tolerant with respect to node failures. Our theoretical results are complemented by extensive simulations that reinforce our main conclusions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22244","fieldValue":"ACM"}
