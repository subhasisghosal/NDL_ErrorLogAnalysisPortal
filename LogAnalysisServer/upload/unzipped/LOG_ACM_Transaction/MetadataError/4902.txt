As scene composition and camera parameters play a vital role in aesthetics of a captured image, the proposed method addresses the problem of learning photographic composition and camera parameters. Further, we observe that context is an important factor from a photography perspective, we therefore augment the learning with associated contextual information. The proposed method utilizes publicly available photographs along with social media cues and associated metainformation in photography learning. We define context features based on factors such as time, geolocation, environmental conditions and type of image, which have an impact on photography. We also propose the idea of computing the photographic composition basis, eigenrules and baserules, to support our composition learning. The proposed system can be used to provide feedback to the user regarding scene composition and camera parameters while the scene is being captured. It can also recommend position in the frame where people should stand for better composition. Moreover, it also provides camera motion guidance for pan, tilt and zoom to the user for improving scene composition."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25717","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25717","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25718","fieldValue":" The aim of this article is to present and discuss an innovative methodology aimed at accessing digitized copies of historical tape music audio documents; the methodology leverages on the multimedia and multisensory capabilities of mobile devices to provide an unprecedented level of fruition. In addition to the methodology, and stemming from it, we present an actual software application for Android tablet devices. This novel piece of software was designed and developed in a multidisciplinary team involving engineers as well as musicians, composers, and archivists. The strongest element in our work is the fact that it follows a rigorous process and it is based on the principles of philological awareness; thus, it also takes into consideration the critical points in the musicologist's domain such as (i) the definition of preservation (i.e., master) copy, (ii) the importance of secondary information, (iii) the history of production and transmission of audio documents."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25718","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25718","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25719","fieldValue":"Ngai, Edith C-H"}
