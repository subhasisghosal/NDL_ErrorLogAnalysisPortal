Hence it is important to assert their correctness with respect to extra-functional properties, like power consumption, temperature, etc. In turn the physical quantities may be exploited for assessing system implementations. This article develops a methodology for utilizing measurements of physical quantities for testing the conformance of a running CPS with respect to a formal description of its required behavior allowing to uncover defects. We present foundations and implementations of this approach and demonstrate its usefulness by conformance testing power measurements of a wireless sensor node with a formal model of its power consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6591","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6591","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6592","fieldValue":"Natale, Marco DI"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6592","fieldValue":"Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Alberto"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6592","fieldValue":" The complexity and physical distribution of modern active safety, chassis, and powertrain automotive applications requires the use of distributed architectures. Complex functions designed as networks of function blocks exchanging signal information are deployed onto the physical HW and implemented in a SW architecture consisting of a set of tasks and messages. The typical configuration features priority-based scheduling of tasks and messages and imposes end-to-end deadlines. In this work, we present and compare formulations and procedures for the optimization of the task allocation, the signal to message mapping, and the assignment of priorities to tasks and messages in order to meet end-to-end deadline constraints and minimize latencies. Our formulations leverage worst-case response time analysis within a mixed integer linear optimization framework and are compared for performance against a simulated annealing implementation. The methods are applied for evaluation to an automotive case study of complexity comparable to industrial design problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6592","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6592","fieldValue":"ACM"}
