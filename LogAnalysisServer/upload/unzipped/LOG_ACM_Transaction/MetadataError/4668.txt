This asks for advanced data assimilation methods that can work with the complex structures and nonlinear behaviors associated with the simulation models. This article presents a data assimilation framework using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods for wildfire spread simulations. The models and algorithms of the framework are described, and experimental results are provided. This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying SMC methods to data assimilation of wildfire spread simulations. The developed framework can potentially be generalized to other application areas where sophisticated simulation models are used."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25061","fieldValue":"DEVS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25062","fieldValue":"Robert, Christian P"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25063","fieldValue":"Le Corff, Sylvain"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25063","fieldValue":" Online variants of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm have recently been proposed to perform parameter inference with large data sets or data streams, in independent latent models and in hidden Markov models. Nevertheless, the convergence properties of these algorithms remain an open problem at least in the hidden Markov case. This contribution deals with a new online EM algorithm that updates the parameter at some deterministic times. Some convergence results have been derived even in general latent models such as hidden Markov models. These properties rely on the assumption that some intermediate quantities are available in closed form or can be approximated by Monte Carlo methods when the Monte Carlo error vanishes rapidly enough. In this article, we propose an algorithm that approximates these quantities using Sequential Monte Carlo methods. The convergence of this algorithm and of an averaged version is established and their performance is illustrated through Monte Carlo experiments."}
