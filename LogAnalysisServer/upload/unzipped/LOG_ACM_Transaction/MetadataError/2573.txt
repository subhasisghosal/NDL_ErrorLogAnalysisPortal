It concentrates on two problems that arise in the implementation of the active set method. One problem is the choice of a good starting point. The second problem is how to move out of a â\u20ACœdead point.â\u20AC? The paper investigates the use of simple iterative methods to solve these problems. The results of our experiments indicate that the use of Gauss-Seidel iterations to obtain a starting point is likely to provide large gains in efficiency. Another interesting conclusion is that dropping one constraint at a time is advantageous to dropping several constraints at a time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18671","fieldValue":"ACM"}
