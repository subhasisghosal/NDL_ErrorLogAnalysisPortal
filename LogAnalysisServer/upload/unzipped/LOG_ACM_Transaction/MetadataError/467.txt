Like the data stream model, the most important parameter for this model is the amount of internal memory used by such an algorithm. The other key parameters are the number of streams the algorithm uses and the number of passes it makes on these streams. We consider how the addition of multiple streams impacts the ability of algorithms to approximate the frequency moments of the input stream. We show that any randomized read\/write stream algorithm with a fixed number of streams and a sublogarithmic number of passes that produces a constant factor approximation of the k-th frequency moment $F_k of an input sequence of length of at most N from {1,..., N} requires space Î©(N$ ^1âˆ\u20194\/kâˆ\u2019Î\u201D) for any Î\u201Dâ\u20AC\u2030>â\u20AC\u20300. For comparison, it is known that with a single read-only one-pass data stream there is a randomized constant-factor approximation for Fk using Ã\u2022(N1âˆ\u20192\/k$) space, and that by sorting, which can be done deterministically in O(log N) passes using 3 read\/write streams, Fk$ can be computed exactly. Therefore, although the ability to manipulate multiple read\/write streams can add substantial power to the data stream model, with a sublogarithmic number of passes this does not significantly improve the ability to approximate higher frequency moments efficiently. We obtain our results by showing a new connection between the read\/write streams model and the multiparty number-in-hand communication model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2193","fieldValue":" Several cryptosystems rely on fast calculations of linear combinations in groups. One way to achieve this is to use joint signed binary digit expansions of small â\u20ACœweight.â\u20AC? We study two algorithms, one based on nonadjacent forms of the coefficients of the linear combination, the other based on a certain joint sparse form specifically adapted to this problem. Both methods are sped up using the sliding windows approach combined with precomputed lookup tables. We give explicit and asymptotic results for the number of group operations needed, assuming uniform distribution of the coefficients. Expected values, variances and a central limit theorem are proved using generating functions.Furthermore, we provide a new algorithm that calculates the digits of an optimal expansion of pairs of integers from left to right. This avoids storing the whole expansion, which is needed with the previously known right-to-left methods, and allows an online computation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12479","fieldValue":" This article gives a separation between quantum and classical models in pure (i.e., noncryptographic) computing abilities with no restriction on the amount of available computing resources, by considering the exact solvability of the leader election problem in anonymous networks, a celebrated unsolvable problem in classical distributed computing. The goal of the leader election problem is to elect a unique leader from among distributed parties. In an anonymous network, all parties with the same number of communication links are identical. It is well-known that no classical algorithm can exactly solve (i.e., in bounded time without error) the leader election problem in anonymous networks, even if the number of parties is given. This article devises a quantum algorithm that, if the number of parties is given, exactly solves the problem for any network topology in polynomial rounds with polynomial communication\/time complexity with respect to the number of parties, when the parties are connected with quantum communication links and they have the ability of quantum computing. Our algorithm works even when only an upper bound of the number of parties is given. In such a case, no classical algorithm can solve the problem even under the zero-error setting, the setting in which error is not allowed but running time may be unbounded."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12479","fieldValue":"ACM"}
