Recently, this assumption was questioned in a number of papers, and the rule was shown to be conservative for certain traffic models. In particular, by appealing to statistical multiplexing, it was shown that on a router with N long-lived connections, buffers of size O(C Ã\u2014 RTT\/âˆšN) or even O(1) are sufficient. In this paper, we reexamine the buffer-size requirements of core routers when flows arrive and depart. Our conclusion is as follows: If the core-to-access-speed ratio is large, then O(1) buffers are sufficient at the core routers; otherwise, larger buffer sizes do improve the flow-level performance of the users. From a modeling point of view, our analysis offers two new insights. First, it may not be appropriate to derive buffer-sizing rules by studying a network with a fixed number of users. In fact, depending upon the core-to-access-speed ratio, the buffer size itself may affect the number of flows in the system, so these two parameters (buffer size and number of flows in the system) should not be treated as independent quantities. Second, in the regime where the core-to-access-speed ratio is large, we note that the O(1) buffer sizes are sufficient for good performance and that no loss of utilization results, as previously believed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10139","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10139","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10139","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10140","fieldValue":"Lin, Che-Jen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10140","fieldValue":" Delay\/disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) technology offers a new solution to highly stressed communications in space environments, especially those with long link delay and frequent link disruptions in deep-space missions. To date, little work has been done in evaluating the performance of the available \"convergence layer\" protocols of DTN, especially the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), when they are applied to an interplanetary Internet (IPN). In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of the Bundle Protocol (BP) running over various \"convergence layer\" protocols in a simulated cislunar communications environment characterized by varying degrees of signal propagation delay and data loss. We focus on the LTP convergence layer (LTPCL) adapter running on top of UDP\/IP (i.e., BP\/LTPCL\/UDP\/IP). The performance of BP\/LTPCL\/UDP\/IP in realistic file transfers over a PC-based network test bed is compared to that of two other DTN protocol stack options, BP\/TCPCL\/TCP\/IP and BP\/UDPCL\/UDP\/IP. A statistical method of t-test is also used for analysis of the experimental results. The experiment results showthat LTPCL has a significant performance advantage over Transmission Control Protocol convergence layer (TCPCL) for link delays longer than 4000 ms regardless of the bit error rate (BER). For a very lossy channel with a BER of around $10^-5$, LTPCL has a significant goodput advantage over TCPCL at all the link delay levels studied, with an advantage of around 3000 B\/s for delays longer than 1500 ms. LTPCL has a consistently significant goodput advantage over UDPCL, around 2500-3000 B\/s, at all levels of link delays and BERs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10140","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10140","fieldValue":"ACM"}
