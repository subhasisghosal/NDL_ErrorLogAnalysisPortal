Most of the existing protein subcellular localization methods are only used to deal with the single-location proteins. In the past few years, only a few methods have been proposed to tackle proteins with multiple locations. However, they only adopt a simple strategy, that is, transforming the multilocation proteins to multiple proteins with single location, which does not take correlations among different subcellular locations into account. In this paper, a novel method named random label selection (RALS) (multilabel learning via RALS), which extends the simple binary relevance (BR) method, is proposed to learn from multilocation proteins in an effective and efficient way. RALS does not explicitly find the correlations among labels, but rather implicitly attempts to learn the label correlations from data by augmenting original feature space with randomly selected labels as its additional input features. Through the fivefold cross-validation test on a benchmark data set, we demonstrate our proposed method with consideration of label correlations obviously outperforms the baseline BR method without consideration of label correlations, indicating correlations among different subcellular locations really exist and contribute to improvement of prediction performance. Experimental results on two benchmark data sets also show that our proposed methods achieve significantly higher performance than some other state-of-the-art methods in predicting subcellular multilocations of proteins.

However, the high dimensionality and low sample size of such data result in many computational problems such as reduced prediction accuracy and slow classification speed. In this paper, we propose a novel family of nonnegative least-squares classifiers for high-dimensional microarray gene expression and comparative genomic hybridization data. Our approaches are based on combining the advantages of using local learning, transductive learning, and ensemble learning, for better prediction performance. To study the performances of our methods, we performed computational experiments on 17 well-known data sets with diverse characteristics. We have also performed statistical comparisons with many classification techniques including the well-performing SVM approach and two related but recent methods proposed in literature. Experimental results show that our approaches are faster and achieve generally a better prediction performance over compared methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4914","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
