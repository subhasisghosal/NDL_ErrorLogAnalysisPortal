The traditional approach to transporting images uses TCP, which provides a generic reliable in-order bytestream abstraction, but which is overly restrictive for image data. We analyze the progression of image quality at the receiver with time, and show that the in-order delivery abstraction provided by a TCP-based approach prevents the receiver application from processing and rendering portions of an image when they actually arrive. The end result is that an image is rendered in bursts interspersed with long idle times rather than smoothly.This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of the image transport protocol (ITP) for image transmission over loss-prone congested or wireless networks. ITP improves user-perceived latency using application-level framing (ALF) and out-of-order application data unit (ADU) delivery, achieving significantly better interactive performance as measured by the evolution of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) with time at the receiver. ITP runs over UDP, incorporates receiver-driven selective reliability, uses the congestion manager (CM) to adapt to network congestion, and is customizable for specific image formats (e.g., JPEG and JPEG2000). ITP enables a variety of new receiver post-processing algorithms such as error concealment that further improve the interactivity and responsiveness of reconstructed images. Performance experiments using our implementation across a variety of loss conditions demonstrate the benefits of ITP in improving the interactivity of image downloads at the receiver."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9094","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1817","fieldValue":"Gregorio, Jose-Angel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1817","fieldValue":" Although abstraction is the best approach to deal with computing system complexity, sometimes implementation details should be considered. Considering on-chip interconnection networks in particular, underestimating the underlying system specificity could have nonnegligible impact on performance, cost, or correctness. This article presents a very efficient router that has been devised to deal with cache-coherent chip multiprocessor particularities in a balanced way. Employing the same principles of packet rotation structures as in the rotary router, we present a router configuration with the following novel features: (1) reduced buffering requirements, (2) optimized pipeline under contentionless conditions, (3) more efficient deadlock avoidance mechanism, and (4) optimized in-order delivery guarantee. Putting it all together, our proposal provides a set of features that no other router, to the best of our knowledge, has achieved previously. These are: (1') low implementation cost, (2') low pass-through latency under low load, (3') improved resource utilization through adaptive routing and a buffering scheme free of head-of-line blocking, (4') guarantee of coherence protocol correctness via end-to-end deadlock avoidance and in-order delivery, and (5') improvement of coherence protocol responsiveness through adaptive in-network multicast support. We conduct a thorough evaluation that includes hardware cost estimation and performance evaluation under a wide spectrum of realistic workloads and coherence protocols. Comparing our proposal with VCTM, an optimized state-of-the-art wormhole router, it requires 50&percnt; less area, reduces on-chip cache hierarchy energy delay product on average by 20&percnt;, and improves the cache-coherency chip multiprocessor performance under realistic working conditions by up to 20&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1817","fieldValue":"ACM"}
