One strategy to perform such an estimation consists of resorting to polynomial fitting, either interpolation or approximation, but this route is difficult for several reasons: choice of the coordinate system, numerical handling of the fitting problem, and extraction of the differential properties. This article presents a generic C++ software package solving these problems. On the theoretical side and as established in a companion paper, the interpolation and approximation methods provided achieve the best asymptotic error bounds known to date. On the implementation side and following state-of-the-art coding rules in computational geometry, genericity of the package is achieved thanks to four template classes accounting for, (a) the type of the input points, (b) the internal geometric computations, (c) a conversion mechanism between these two geometries, and (d) the linear algebra operations. An instantiation within the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL, version 3.3) and using LAPACK is also provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19229","fieldValue":"Algorithm 889: Jet_fitting_3:---A Generic C++ Package for Estimating the Differential Properties on Sampled Surfaces via Polynomial Fitting"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2861","fieldValue":" Sentence reduction is the removal of redundant words or phrases from an input sentence by creating a new sentence in which the gist of the original meaning of the sentence remains unchanged. All previous methods required a syntax parser before sentences could be reduced; hence it was difficult to apply them to a language with no reliable parser. In this article we propose two new sentence-reduction algorithms that do not use syntactic parsing for the input sentence. The first algorithm, based on the template-translation learning algorithm, one of example-based machine-translation methods, works quite well in reducing sentences, but its computational complexity can be exponential in certain cases. The second algorithm, an extension of the template--translation algorithm via innovative employment of the Hidden Markov model, which uses the set of template rules learned from examples, can overcome this computation problem. Experiments show that the proposed algorithms achieve acceptable results in comparison to sentence reduction done by humans."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19230","fieldValue":" We propose a standard for generating, manipulating, and storing metadata describing numerical problems, in particular properties of matrices and linear systems.

The API is open-ended, allowing for other parties to define additional metadata categories to be generated and stored within this framework. Furthermore, we present two software libraries, NMD and AnaMod, that implement this standard, and that contain a number of computational modules for numerical metadata. The libraries, more than simply illustrating the use of the standard, provide considerable utility to numerical researchers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19230","fieldValue":"ACM"}
