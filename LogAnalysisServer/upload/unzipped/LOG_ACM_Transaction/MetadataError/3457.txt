We study it in its most basic form, assuming a binary sensing model in which each sensor returns only 1-bit information regarding target's presence or absence within its sensing range. A novel, real-time and distributed target tracking algorithm is introduced. The algorithm is energy efficient and fault tolerant. It estimates the target location, velocity, and trajectory in a distributed and asynchronous manner. The accuracy of the algorithm is analytically derived under an ideal binary sensing model and extensive simulations of ideal, imperfect, and faulty sensing models show that the algorithm achieves good performance. It outperforms other published algorithms by yielding highly accurate estimates of the target's location, velocity, and trajectory."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21321","fieldValue":" The problem of time-varying channel estimation in multihop sensor networks is examined. Two relay processing methods are explored: amplify-and-forward and encode-and-forward. Bounds on the end-to-end distortion for all internode channel estimates are computed for these two relay processing schemes. Performance is analyzed via the asymptotic limit of the decay rate of the end-to-end distortion with respect to SNR at high SNR. It is also established that asymptotically in SNR, amplify-and-forward can outperform encode-and-forward and in fact can achieve the maximum possible distortion exponent (distortion decay rate) order of unity. Linear and many-to-one topologies are then examined and it is shown that orthogonal access in the many-to-one network is optimal."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21321","fieldValue":"Asymptotic distortion exponents for the estimation of time-varying channels in multihop sensor networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21322","fieldValue":"Jang, Ki-Young"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21322","fieldValue":" Most sensor network research and software design has been guided by an architectural principle that permits multinode data fusion on small-form-factor, resource-poor nodes, or motes. While we were among the earliest promoters of this approach, through experience we found that this principle leads to fragile and unmanageable systems and explore an alternative. The Tenet architecture is motivated by the observation that future large-scale sensor network deployments will be tiered, consisting of motes in the lower tier and masters, relatively unconstrained 32-bit platform nodes, in the upper tier. Tenet constrains multinode fusion to the master tier while allowing motes to process locally-generated sensor data. This simplifies application development and allows mote-tier software to be reused. Applications running on masters task motes by composing task descriptions from a novel tasklet library. Our Tenet implementation also contains a robust and scalable networking subsystem for disseminating tasks and reliably delivering responses. We show that a Tenet pursuit-evasion application exhibits performance comparable to a mote-native implementation while being considerably more compact. We also present two real-world deployments of Tenet system: a structural vibration monitoring application at Vincent Thomas Bridge and an imaging-based habitat monitoring application at James Reserve, and show that tiered architecture scales network capacity and allows reliable delivery of high rate $data.^1$"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21322","fieldValue":"ACM"}
