{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4873","fieldValue":" We present a mathematical model and exact algorithm for optimally aligning protein structures using the dali scoring model. This scoring model is based on comparing the interresidue distance matrices of proteins and is used in the popular dali software tool, a heuristic method for protein structure alignment. Our model and algorithm extend an integer linear programming approach that has been previously applied for the related, but simpler, contact map overlap problem. To this end, we introduce a novel type of constraint that handles negative score values and relax it in a Lagrangian fashion. The new algorithm, which we call dalix, is applicable to any distance matrix-based scoring scheme. We also review options that allow to consider fewer pairs of interresidue distances explicitly because their large number hinders the optimization process. Using four known data sets of varying structural similarity, we compute many provably score-optimal dali alignments. This allowed, for the first time, to evaluate the dali heuristic in sound mathematical terms. The results indicate that dali usually computes optimal or close to optimal alignments. However, we detect a subset of small proteins for which dali fails to generate any significant alignment, although such alignments do exist."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4873","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4873","fieldValue":"Proteins,Mathematical model,Dynamic programming,Linear programming,Computational biology,Bioinformatics,Amino acids,DALI,Structure alignment,interresidue distance matrix,exact algorithm,integer linear program,Lagrangian relaxation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4873","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4873","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4874","fieldValue":"Higa, Carlos H A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4874","fieldValue":" Models of gene regulatory networks (GRN) have been proposed along with algorithms for inferring their structure. By structure, we mean the relationships among the genes of the biological system under study. Despite the large number of genes found in the genome of an organism, it is believed that a small set of genes is responsible for maintaining a specific core regulatory mechanism (small subnetworks). We propose an algorithm for inference of subnetworks of genes from a small initial set of genes called seed and time series gene expression data. The algorithm has two main steps: First, it grows the seed of genes by adding genes to it, and second, it searches for subnetworks that can be biologically meaningful. The seed growing step is treated as a feature selection problem and we used a thresholded Boolean network with a perturbation model to design the criterion function that is used to select the features (genes). Given that the reverse engineering of GRN is a problem that does not necessarily have one unique solution, the proposed algorithm has as output a set of networks instead of one single network. The algorithm also analyzes the dynamics of the networks which can be time-consuming. Nevertheless, the algorithm is suitable when the number of genes is small. The results showed that the algorithm is capable of recovering an acceptable rate of gene interactions and to generate regulatory hypotheses that can be explored in the wet lab."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4874","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4874","fieldValue":"Biological system modeling,Inference algorithms,Computational modeling,Bioinformatics,Gene expression,Boolean functions,Time series analysis,reverse engineering,Gene regulatory networks,Boolean networks,inference"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4874","fieldValue":"ACM"}
