However, as different loci may support different trees due to processes such as gene duplication and lineage sorting, it is important to better understand how commonly used phylogenetic inference methods behave on such \"phylogenetic mixtures\". Here we shall focus on how parsimony, one of the most popular methods for reconstructing phylogenetic trees, behaves for mixtures of two trees. In particular, we show that (i) the parsimony problem is NP-complete for mixtures of two trees, (ii) there are mixtures of two trees that have exponentially many (in the number of leaves) most parsimonious trees, and (iii) give an explicit description of the most parsimonious tree(s) and scores corresponding to the mixture of a pair of trees related by a single TBR operation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4403","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4403","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4403","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4404","fieldValue":" The evolutionary history of a collection of species is usually represented by a phylogenetic tree. Sometimes, phylogenetic networks are used as a means of representing reticulate evolution or of showing uncertainty and incompatibilities in evolutionary datasets. This is often done using unrooted phylogenetic networks such as split networks, due in part, to the availability of software (SplitsTree) for their computation and visualization. In this paper we discuss the problem of drawing rooted phylogenetic networks as cladograms or phylograms in a number of different views that are commonly used for rooted trees. Implementations of the algorithms are available in new releases of the Dendroscope and SplitsTree programs."}
