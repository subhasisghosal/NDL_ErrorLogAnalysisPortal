Three-base periodicity is commonly detected using short time Fourier transform (STFT) that uses a window function of fixed length. As the length of the protein coding and noncoding regions varies widely, the identification accuracy of STFT-based algorithms is poor. In this paper, a novel signal processing-based algorithm is developed by enabling the window length adaptation in STFT of DNA sequences for improving the identification of three-base periodicity. The length of the window function has been made adaptive in coding regions to maximize the magnitude of period-3 measure, whereas in the noncoding regions, the window length is tailored to minimize this measure. Simulation results on bench mark data sets demonstrate the advantage of this algorithm when compared with other non-data-driven methods for CDS prediction."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4964","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4964","fieldValue":"Bioinformatics, signal processing, window function, short time Fourier transform (STFT), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4964","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4964","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4965","fieldValue":" A coalescent history is an assignment of branches of a gene tree to branches of a species tree on which coalescences in the gene tree occur. The number of coalescent histories for a pair consisting of a labeled gene tree topology and a labeled species tree topology is important in gene tree probability computations, and more generally, in studying evolutionary possibilities for gene trees on species trees. Defining the $(T_r)$-caterpillar-like family as a sequence of $(n)$-taxon trees constructed by replacing the $(r)$-taxon subtree of $(n)$-taxon caterpillars by a specific $(r)$-taxon labeled topology $(T_r)$, we examine the number of coalescent histories for caterpillar-like families with matching gene tree and species tree labeled topologies. For each $(T_r)$ with size $(r\\le 8)$, we compute the number of coalescent histories for $(n)$-taxon trees in the $(T_r)$-caterpillar-like family. Next, as $(n\\rightarrow \\infty)$, we find that the limiting ratio of the numbers of coalescent histories for the $(T_r)$ family and caterpillars themselves is correlated with the number of labeled histories for $(T_r)$. The results support a view that large numbers of coalescent histories occur when a tree has both a relatively balanced subtree and a high tree depth, contributing to deeper understanding of the combinatorics of gene trees and species trees."}
