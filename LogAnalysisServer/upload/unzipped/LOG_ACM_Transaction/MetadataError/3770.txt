Research on most of the noncursive scripts (Latin) has matured, whereas research on the cursive (connected) scripts is still moving toward perfection. Many researchers are currently working on the cursive scripts (Arabic and other scripts adopting it) around the world so that the difficulties and challenges in document understanding and handling of these scripts can be overcome. Sindhi script has the largest extension of the original Arabic alphabet among languages adopting the Arabic script; it contains 52 characters, compared to 28 characters in the original Arabic alphabet, in order to accommodate more sounds for the language. There are 24 differentiating characters with some possessing four dots. For Sindhi OCR research and development, a database is needed for training and testing of Sindhi text images. We have developed a large database containing over 4 billion words and 15 billion characters in 150 various fonts in four font weights and four styles. The database contents were collected from various sources including websites, books, and theses. A custom-built application was also developed to create a text image from a text document that supports various fonts and sizes. The database considers words, characters, characters with spaces, and lines. The database is freely available as a partial or full database by sending an email to one of the authors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3114","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3114","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22174","fieldValue":" Secure and reliable group communication is an active area of research. Its popularity is fueled by the growing importance of group-oriented and collaborative applications. The central research challenge is secure and efficient group key management. While centralized methods are often appropriate for key distribution in large multicast-style groups, many collaborative group settings require distributed key agreement techniques. This work investigates a novel group key agreement approach which blends key trees with Diffie--Hellman key exchange. It yields a secure protocol suite called Tree-based Group Diffie--Hellman (TGDH) that is both simple and fault-tolerant. Moreover, the efficiency of TGDH appreciably surpasses that of prior art."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22174","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22174","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22175","fieldValue":" This paper addresses the identifier ownership problem. It does so by using characteristics of Statistical Uniqueness and Cryptographic Verifiability (SUCV) of certain entities which this document calls SUCV Identifiers and Addresses, or, alternatively, Crypto-based Identifiers. Their characteristics allow them to severely limit certain classes of denial-of-service attacks and hijacking attacks. SUCV addresses are particularly applicable to solve the address ownership problem that hinders mechanisms like Binding Updates in Mobile IPv6."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22175","fieldValue":"ACM"}
