Recent work on a 2-state symmetric model of character change showed that for 4 taxa, such a mixture model has nonidentifiable parameters, and thus, it is theoretically impossible to determine the two tree topologies from any amount of data under such circumstances. Here, the question of identifiability is investigated for two-tree mixtures of the 4-state group-based models, which are more relevant to DNA sequence data. Using algebraic techniques, we show that the tree parameters are identifiable for the JC and K2P models. We also prove that generic substitution parameters for the JC mixture models are identifiable, and for the K2P and K3P models obtain generic identifiability results for mixtures on the same tree. This indicates that the full phylogenetic signal remains in such mixtures, and the 2-state symmetric result is thus a misleading guide to the behavior of other models."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4625","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4625","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4625","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4626","fieldValue":" Microarray gene expression data often contain missing values. Accurate estimation of the missing values is important for downstream data analyses that require complete data. Nonlinear relationships between gene expression levels have not been well-utilized in missing value imputation. We propose an imputation scheme based on nonlinear dependencies between genes. By simulations based on real microarray data, we show that incorporating nonlinear relationships could improve the accuracy of missing value imputation, both in terms of normalized root-mean-squared error and in terms of the preservation of the list of significant genes in statistical testing. In addition, we studied the impact of artificial dependencies introduced by data normalization on the simulation results. Our results suggest that methods relying on global correlation structures may yield overly optimistic simulation results when the data have been subjected to row (gene)-wise mean removal."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4626","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4627","fieldValue":" Metabolic pathways show the complex interactions among enzymes that transform chemical compounds. The state of a metabolic pathway can be expressed as a vector, which denotes the yield of the compounds or the flux in that pathway at a given time. The steady state is a state that remains unchanged over time. Altering the state of the metabolism is very important for many applications such as biomedicine, biofuels, food industry, and cosmetics. The goal of the enzymatic target identification problem is to identify the set of enzymes whose knockouts lead the metabolism to a state that is close to a given goal state. Given that the size of the search space is exponential in the number of enzymes, the target identification problem is very computationally intensive. We develop efficient algorithms to solve the enzymatic target identification problem in this paper. Unlike existing algorithms, our method works for a broad set of metabolic network models. We measure the effect of the knockouts of a set of enzymes as a function of the deviation of the steady state of the pathway after their knockouts from the goal state. We develop two algorithms to find the enzyme set with minimal deviation from the goal state. The first one is a traversal approach that explores possible solutions in a systematic way using a branch and bound method. The second one uses genetic algorithms to derive good solutions from a set of alternative solutions iteratively. Unlike the former one, this one can run for very large pathways. Our experiments show that our algorithms' results follow those obtained in vitro in the literature from a number of applications. They also show that the traversal method is a good approximation of the exhaustive search algorithm and it is up to 11 times faster than the exhaustive one. This algorithm runs efficiently for pathways with up to 30 enzymes. For large pathways, our genetic algorithm can find good solutions in less than 10 minutes."}
