{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16357","fieldValue":" We present an error estimation framework for progressive photon mapping. Although estimating rendering error has been established for unbiased rendering algorithms, error estimation for biased rendering algorithms has not been investigated well in comparison. We characterize the error by the sum of a bias estimate and a stochastic noise bound, which is motivated by stochastic error bounds formulation in biased methods. As a part of our error computation, we extend progressive photon mapping to operate with smooth kernels. This enables the calculation of illumination gradients with arbitrary accuracy, which we use to progressively compute the local bias in the radiance estimate. We also show how variance can be computed in progressive photon mapping, which is used to estimate the error due to noise. As an example application, we show how our error estimation can be used to compute images with a given error threshold. For this example application, our framework only requires the error threshold and a confidence level to automatically terminate rendering. Our results demonstrate how our error estimation framework works well in realistic synthetic scenes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16357","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16357","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16358","fieldValue":" Edge-aware operations, such as edge-preserving smoothing and edge-aware interpolation, require assessing the degree of similarity between pairs of pixels, typically defined as a simple monotonic function of the Euclidean distance between pixel values in some feature space. In this work we introduce the idea of replacing these Euclidean distances with diffusion distances, which better account for the global distribution of pixels in their feature space. These distances are approximated using diffusion maps: a set of the dominant eigenvectors of a large affinity matrix, which may be computed efficiently by sampling a small number of matrix columns (the Nyström method). We demonstrate the benefits of using diffusion distances in a variety of image editing contexts, and explore the use of diffusion maps as a tool for facilitating the creation of complex selection masks. Finally, we present a new analysis that establishes a connection between the spatial interaction range between two pixels, and the number of samples necessary for accurate Nyström approximations."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/16358","fieldValue":"Nystr&ouml;m method"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16359","fieldValue":"Wong, Tien-Tsin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16359","fieldValue":"Xu, Ying-Qing"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16359","fieldValue":" It is often important for designers and photographers to convey or enhance desired color themes in their work. A color theme is typically defined as a template of colors and an associated verbal description. This paper presents a data-driven method for enhancing a desired color theme in an image. We formulate our goal as a unified optimization that simultaneously considers a desired color theme, texture-color relationships as well as automatic or user-specified color constraints. Quantifying the difference between an image and a color theme is made possible by color mood spaces and a generalization of an additivity relationship for two-color combinations. We incorporate prior knowledge, such as texture-color relationships, extracted from a database of photographs to maintain a natural look of the edited images. Experiments and a user study have confirmed the effectiveness of our method."}
