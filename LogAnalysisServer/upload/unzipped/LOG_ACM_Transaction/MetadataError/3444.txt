The problem of data forwarding is complicated by the severe energy constraints of sensors in WSNs. In this work, we propose and analyze a data forwarding scheme, termed Multihop\/Direct Forwarding (MDF), for WSNs where sensor nodes forward data traffic toward a common data sink. In the MDF scheme, a node splits outgoing traffic into at most two branches: one is sent to a node that is h units away; the other is sent directly to the data sink. The value of h is chosen to minimize the overall energy consumption of the network. The direct transmission is employed to balance the energy consumption of nodes at different locations and to avoid the so-called hot spot problem in data forwarding. In order to calculate its traffic splitting ratio, a node only needs to know the distance toward the common data sink and that of the farthest node. Our analytical and simulation results show that the MDF scheme performs close to, in terms of energy efficiency and network lifetime, the optimum data forwarding rules, which are more complex and computation intensive."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21288","fieldValue":" Most work in sensor networks tries to maximize network lifetime. However, for many applications the required lifetime is known in advance. Therefore, application quality should rather be maximized for that given time.Levels, the approach presented in this article, is a programming abstraction for energy-aware sensor network applications that helps to meet such a user-defined lifetime goal by deactivating optional functionality. With this programming abstraction, the application developer defines so-called energy levels. Functionality in energy levels is deactivated if the required lifetime cannot be met otherwise. The runtime system uses data about the energy consumption of different levels to compute an optimal level assignment that maximizes each node's quality for the time remaining. As described in this paper, Levels includes a completely distributed coordination algorithm that balances energy level assignments and keeps the application quality of the network roughly constant over time. In this approach, each node computes its schedule based on those of its neighbors. As the evaluation shows, applications using Levels can accurately meet given lifetime goals with only small fluctuations in application quality. In addition, the runtime overhead both for computation and for communication is negligible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21288","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21288","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3029","fieldValue":"Huang, Chung-Chi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3029","fieldValue":"Chen, Mei-Hua"}
