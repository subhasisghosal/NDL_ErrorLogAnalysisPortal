In this paper, we seek a closed-form skinning method that approximates nonlinear elastic deformations well while remaining very fast. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we optimize skinning weights for the standard linear and dual quaternion skinning techniques so that the resulting deformations minimize an elastic energy function. We observe that this is not sufficient to match the visual quality of the original elastic deformations and therefore, we develop (2) a new skinning method based on the concept of joint-based deformers. We propose a specific deformer which is visually similar to nonlinear variational deformation methods. Our final algorithm is fully automatic and requires little or no input from the user other than a rest-pose mesh and a skeleton. The runtime complexity requires minimal memory and computational overheads compared to linear blend skinning, while producing higher quality deformations than both linear and dual quaternion skinning."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16786","fieldValue":" Lattice deformers are a popular option for modeling the behavior of elastic bodies as they avoid the need for conforming mesh generation, and their regular structure offers significant opportunities for performance optimizations. Our work expands the scope of current lattice-based elastic deformers, adding support for a number of important simulation features. We accommodate complex nonlinear, optionally anisotropic materials while using an economical one-point quadrature scheme. Our formulation fully accommodates near-incompressibility by enforcing accurate nonlinear constraints, supports implicit integration for large time steps, and is not susceptible to locking or poor conditioning of the discrete equations. Additionally, we increase the accuracy of our solver by employing a novel high-order quadrature scheme on lattice cells overlapping with the model boundary, which are treated at sub-cell precision. Finally, we detail how this accurate boundary treatment can be implemented at a minimal computational premium over the cost of a voxel-accurate discretization. We demonstrate our method in the simulation of complex musculoskeletal human models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16787","fieldValue":"DeCarlo, Doug"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16787","fieldValue":" The creation of a 3D model is only the first stage of the 3D character animation pipeline. Once a model has been created, and before it can be animated, it must be rigged. Manual rigging is laborious, and automatic rigging approaches are far from real-time and do not allow for incremental updates. This is a hindrance in the real world, where the shape of a model is often revised after rigging has been performed. In this paper, we introduce algorithms and a user-interface for sketch-based 3D modeling that unify the modeling and rigging stages of the 3D character animation pipeline. Our algorithms create a rig for each sketched part in real-time, and update the rig as parts are merged or cut. As a result, users can freely pose and animate their shapes and characters while rapidly iterating on the base shape. The rigs are compatible with the state-of-the-art character animation pipeline; they consist of a low-dimensional skeleton along with skin weights identifying the surface with bones of the skeleton."}
