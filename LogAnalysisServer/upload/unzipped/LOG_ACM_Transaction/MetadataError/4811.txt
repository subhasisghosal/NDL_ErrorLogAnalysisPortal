Individuals were provided with footstep sounds simulating different surface materials. The sounds were interactively generated using shoes with pressure sensors. Results showed that subjects' walking speed changed as a function of the type of simulated ground material. This effect may arise due to the presence of conflicting information between the auditory and foot-haptic modality, or because of an adjustment of locomotion to the physical properties evoked by the sounds simulating the ground materials. The results reported in this study suggest that auditory feedback may be more important in the regulation of walking in natural environments than has been acknowledged. Furthermore, auditory feedback could be used to develop novel approaches to the design of therapeutic and rehabilitation procedures for locomotion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3460","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3460","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25469","fieldValue":" Three-dimensional video (3DV) is attracting many interests with its enhanced viewing experience and more user driven features. 3DV has several unique characteristics different from 2D video: (1) It has a much larger amount of data captured and compressed, and corresponding video compression techniques can be much more complicated in order to explore data redundancy. This will lead to more constraints on users' network access and computational capability, (2) Most users only need part of the 3DV data at any given time, while the users' requirements exhibit large diversity, (3) Only a limited number of views are captured and transmitted for 3DV. View rendering is thus necessary to generate virtual views based on the received 3DV data. However, many terminal devices do not have the functionality to generate virtual views. To enable 3DV experience for the majority of users with limited capabilities, adaptive 3DV transmission is necessary to extract\/generate the required data content and represent it with supported formats and bitrates for heterogeneous terminal devices. 3DV transcoding is an emerging and effective technique to achieve desired adaptive 3DV transmission. In this article, we propose the first efficient 3DV transcoding scheme that can obtain any desired view, either an encoded one or a virtual one, and compress it with more universal H.264\/AVC. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to appropriately utilize motion information contained in the bitstream to generate candidate motion information. Original information of both the desired view and reference views are used to obtain this candidate information and a proper motion refinement process is carried out for certain blocks. Simulation results show that, compared to the straightforward cascade algorithm, the proposed scheme is able to output compressed bitstream of the required view with significantly reduced complexity while incurring negligible performance loss. Such a 3DV transcoding can be applied to most gateways that usually have constraints on computational complexity and time delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25470","fieldValue":" With the growing demand for 3D video, efforts are underway to incorporate it in the next generation of broadcast and streaming applications and standards. 3D video is currently available in games, entertainment, education, security, and surveillance applications. A typical scenario for multiview 3D consists of several 3D video sequences captured simultaneously from the same scene with the help of multiple cameras from different positions and through different angles. Multiview video coding provides a compact representation of these multiple views by exploiting the large amount of inter-view statistical dependencies. One of the major challenges in this field is how to transmit the large amount of data of a multiview sequence over error prone channels to heterogeneous mobile devices with different bandwidth, resolution, and processing\/battery power, while maintaining a high visual quality. Scalable Multiview 3D Video Coding (SMVC) is one of the methods to address this challenge; however, the evaluation of the overall visual quality of the resulting scaled-down video requires a new objective perceptual quality measure specifically designed for scalable multiview 3D video. Although several subjective and objective quality assessment methods have been proposed for multiview 3D sequences, no comparable attempt has been made for quality assessment of scalable multiview 3D video. In this article, we propose a new methodology to build suitable objective quality assessment metrics for different scalable modalities in multiview 3D video. Our proposed methodology considers the importance of each layer and its content as a quality of experience factor in the overall quality. Furthermore, in addition to the quality of each layer, the concept of disparity between layers (inter-layer disparity) and disparity between the units of each layer (intra-layer disparity) is considered as an effective feature to evaluate overall perceived quality more accurately. Simulation results indicate that by using this methodology, more efficient objective quality assessment metrics can be introduced for each multiview 3D video scalable modalities."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25470","fieldValue":"A new methodology to derive objective quality assessment metrics for scalable multiview 3D video coding"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25470","fieldValue":"ACM"}
