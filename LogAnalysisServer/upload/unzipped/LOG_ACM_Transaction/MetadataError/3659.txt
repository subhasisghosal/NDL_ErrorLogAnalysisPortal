{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3087","fieldValue":" Handwritten Arabic character recognition systems face several challenges, including the unlimited variation in human handwriting and the unavailability of large public databases of handwritten characters and words. The use of synthetic data for training and testing handwritten character recognition systems is one of the possible solutions to provide several variations for these characters and to overcome the lack of large databases. While this can be using arbitrary distortions, such as image noise and randomized affine transformations, such distortions are not realistic. In this work, we model real distortions in handwriting using real handwritten Arabic character examples and then use these distortion models to synthesize handwritten examples that are more realistic. We show that the use of our proposed approach leads to significant improvements across different machine-learning classification algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3087","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3087","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21827","fieldValue":"Ostadzadeh, S Arash"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21827","fieldValue":" There has been a steady increase in the utilization of heterogeneous architectures to tackle the growing need for computing performance and low-power systems. The execution of computation-intensive functions on specialized hardware enables to achieve substantial speedups and power savings. However, with a large legacy code base and software engineering experts, it is not at all obvious how to easily utilize these new architectures. As a result, there is a need for comprehensive tool support to bridge the knowledge gap of many engineers as well as to retarget legacy code. In this article, we present the Quipu modeling approach, which consists of a set of tools and a modeling methodology that can generate hardware estimation models, which provide valuable information for developers. This information helps to focus their efforts, to partition their application, and to select the right heterogeneous components. We present Quipuâ\u20AC™s capability to generate domain-specific models, that are up to several times more accurate within their particular domain (error: 4.6&percnt;) as compared to domain-agnostic models (error: 23&percnt;). Finally, we show how Quipu can generate models for a new toolchain and platform within a few days."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21827","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21827","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21828","fieldValue":"de Dinechin, Florent"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21828","fieldValue":"Lpez-Vallejo, Marisa"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21828","fieldValue":" The high performance and capacity of current FPGAs makes them suitable as acceleration co-processors. This article studies the implementation, for such accelerators, of the floating-point power function $x^y$ as defined by the C99 and IEEE 754-2008 standards, generalized here to arbitrary exponent and mantissa sizes. Last-bit accuracy at the smallest possible cost is obtained thanks to a careful study of the various subcomponents: a floating-point logarithm, a modified floating-point exponential, and a truncated floating-point multiplier. A parameterized architecture generator in the open-source FloPoCo project is presented in details and evaluated."}
