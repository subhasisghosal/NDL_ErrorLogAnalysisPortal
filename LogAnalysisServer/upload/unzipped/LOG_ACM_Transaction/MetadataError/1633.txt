Notably, our method uses the standard Cartesian fluid discretization and does not require (moving) conforming tetrahedral meshes or ALE frameworks. Furthermore, we use a standard Lagrangian framework for the solid, thus supporting arbitrary solid constitutive models, both implicit and explicit time integration, etc. The method is quite general, working for smoke, water, and multiphase fluids as well as both rigid and deformable solids, and both volumes and thin shells. Rigid shells and cloth are handled automatically without special treatment, and we support fully one-sided discretizations without leaking. Our equations are fully symmetric, allowing for the use of fast solvers, which is a natural result of properly conserving momentum. Finally, for simple explicit time integration of rigid bodies, we show that our equations reduce to form similar to previous work via a single block Gaussian elimination operation, but that this approach scales poorly, i.e. as though four spatial dimensions rather than three."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2509","fieldValue":" We describe a new sampling-based method to determine cuts in an undirected graph. For a graph (V, E), its cycle space is the family of all subsets of E that have even degree at each vertex. We prove that with high probability, sampling the cycle space identifies the cuts of a graph. This leads to simple new linear-time sequential algorithms for finding all cut edges and cut pairs (a set of 2 edges that form a cut) of a graph. In the model of distributed computing in a graph G &equals; (V, E) with O(log &vert;V&vert;)-bit messages, our approach yields faster algorithms for several problems. The diameter of G is denoted by D, and the maximum degree by Î\u201D. We obtain simple O(D)-time distributed algorithms to find all cut edges, 2-edge-connected components, and cut pairs, matching or improving upon previous time bounds. Under natural conditions these new algorithms are universally optimalâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, a Î©(D)-time lower bound holds on every graph. We obtain a O(D+Î\u201D\/log &vert;V&vert;)-time distributed algorithm for finding cut vertices; this is faster than the best previous algorithm when Î\u201D, D &equals; O(&sqrt;&vert;V&vert;). A simple extension of our work yields the first distributed algorithm with sub-linear time for 3-edge-connected components. The basic distributed algorithms are Monte Carlo, but they can be made Las Vegas without increasing the asymptotic complexity. In the model of parallel computing on the EREW PRAM, our approach yields a simple algorithm with optimal time complexity O(log V) for finding cut pairs and 3-edge-connected components."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15919","fieldValue":" We introduce a method for efficiently animating a wide range of deformable materials. We combine a high resolution surface mesh with a tetrahedral finite element simulator that makes use of frequent re-meshing. This combination allows for fast and detailed simulations of complex elastic and plastic behavior. We significantly expand the range of physical parameters that can be simulated with a single technique, and the results are free from common artifacts such as volume-loss, smoothing, popping, and the absence of thin features like strands and sheets. Our decision to couple a high resolution surface with low-resolution physics leads to efficient simulation and detailed surface features, and our approach to creating the tetrahedral mesh leads to an order-of-magnitude speedup over previous techniques in the time spent re-meshing. We compute masses, collisions, and surface tension forces on the scale of the fine mesh, which helps avoid visual artifacts due to the differing mesh resolutions. The result is a method that can simulate a large array of different material behaviors with high resolution features in a short amount of time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15919","fieldValue":"ACM"}
