Cancer progresses as stages over time typically with increasing aggressiveness and worsening prognosis. Characterizing these stages and identifying the genes driving transitions between them is critical to understand cancer progression and to develop effective anti-cancer therapies. In this work, we propose a novel model for the 'cancer system' as a Boolean state space in which a Boolean network, built from protein-interaction and gene-expression data from different stages of cancer, transits between Boolean satisfiability states by \"editing\" interactions and \"flipping\" genes. Edits reflect rewiring of the PPI network while flipping of genes reflect activation or silencing of genes between stages. We formulate a minimization problem MIN FLIP to identify these genes driving the transitions. The application of our model (called BoolSpace) on three case studies--pancreatic and breast tumours in human and post spinal-cord injury (SCI) in rats--reveals valuable insights into the phenomenon of cancer progression: (i) interactions involved in core cell-cycle and DNA-damage repair pathways are significantly rewired in tumours, indicating significant impact to key genome-stabilizing mechanisms; (ii) several of the genes flipped are serine\/threonine kinases which act as biological switches, reflecting cellular switching mechanisms between stages; and (iii) different sets of genes are flipped during the initial and final stages indicating a pattern to tumour progression. Based on these results, we hypothesize that robustness of cancer partly stems from \"passing of the baton\" between genes at different stages--genes from different biological processes and\/or cellular components are involved in different stages of tumour progression thereby allowing tumour cells to evade targeted therapy, and therefore an effective therapy should target a \"cover set\" of these genes.

The motto of differential expression analysis is to identify the transcripts whose expressions change significantly across different types of samples or experimental conditions. A number of statistical testing methods are available for this purpose. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on different parametric and non-parametric testing methodologies for identifying differential expression from microarray data sets. The performances of the different testing methods have been compared based on some real-life miRNA and mRNA expression data sets. For validating the resulting differentially expressed miRNAs, the outcomes of each test are checked with the information available for miRNA in the standard miRNA database PhenomiR 2.0. Subsequently, we have prepared different simulated data sets of different sample sizes (from 10 to 100 per group\/population) and thereafter the power of each test have been calculated individually. The comparative simulated study might lead to formulate robust and comprehensive judgements about the performance of each test in the basis of assumption of data distribution. Finally, a list of advantages and limitations of the different statistical tests has been provided, along with indications of some areas where further studies are required."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5025","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5025","fieldValue":"A survey and comparative study of statistical tests for identifying differential expression from microarray data"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5025","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5025","fieldValue":"ACM"}
