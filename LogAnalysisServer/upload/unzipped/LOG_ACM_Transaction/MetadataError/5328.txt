Due to evolutionary pressures on proteins to maintain structure and function, the sequence record of a protein family contains valuable information regarding position-specific residue conservation and coupling (or covariation) constraints. Representing these constraints with a graphical model provides two key benefits for protein design: a probabilistic semantics enabling evaluation of possible sequences for consistency with the constraints, and an explicit factorization of residue dependence and independence supporting efficient exploration of the constrained sequence space. We leverage these benefits in developing two complementary MCMC algorithms for protein design: constrained shuffling mixes wild-type sequences positionwise and evaluates graphical model likelihood, while component sampling directly generates sequences by sampling clique values and propagating to other cliques. We apply our methods to design WW domains. We demonstrate that likelihood under a model of wild-type WWs is highly predictive of foldedness of new WWs. We then show both theoretical and rapid empirical convergence of our algorithms in generating high-likelihood, diverse new sequences. We further show that these sequences capture the original sequence constraints, yielding a model as predictive of foldedness as the original one."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4442","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4443","fieldValue":" The use of partial covariance models to search for RNA family members in genomic sequence databases is explored. The partial models are formed from contiguous subranges of the overall RNA family multiple alignment columns. A binary decision-tree framework is presented for choosing the order to apply the partial models and the score thresholds on which to make the decisions. The decision trees are chosen to minimize computation time subject to the constraint that all of the training sequences are passed to the full covariance model for final evaluation. Computational intelligence methods are suggested to select the decision tree since the tree can be quite complex and there is no obvious method to build the tree in these cases. Experimental results from seven RNA families shows execution times of 0.066-0.268 relative to using the full covariance model alone. Tests on the full sets of known sequences for each family show that at least 95 percent of these sequences are found for two families and 100 percent for five others. Since the full covariance model is run on all sequences accepted by the partial model decision tree, the false alarm rate is at least as low as that of the full model alone."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4443","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4443","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4443","fieldValue":"ACM"}
