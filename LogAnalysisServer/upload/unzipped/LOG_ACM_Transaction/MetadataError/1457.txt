{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15459","fieldValue":" Due to rapid technological progress in high dynamic range (HDR) video capture and display, the efficient storage and transmission of such data is crucial for the completeness of any HDR imaging pipeline. We propose a new approach for inter-frame encoding of HDR video, which is embedded in the well-established MPEG-4 video compression standard. The key component of our technique is luminance quantization that is optimized for the contrast threshold perception in the human visual system. The quantization scheme requires only 10--11 bits to encode 12 orders of magnitude of visible luminance range and does not lead to perceivable contouring artifacts. Besides video encoding, the proposed quantization provides perceptually-optimized luminance sampling for fast implementation of any global tone mapping operator using a lookup table. To improve the quality of synthetic video sequences, we introduce a coding scheme for discrete cosine transform (DCT) blocks with high contrast. We demonstrate the capabilities of HDR video in a player, which enables decoding, tone mapping, and applying post-processing effects in real-time. The tone mapping algorithm as well as its parameters can be changed interactively while the video is playing. We can simulate post-processing effects such as glare, night vision, and motion blur, which appear very realistic due to the usage of HDR data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15459","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15459","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15460","fieldValue":" In this paper we introduce a new perceptual metric for efficient, high quality, global illumination rendering. The metric is based on a rendering-by-components framework in which the direct, and indirect diffuse, glossy, and specular light transport paths are separately computed and then composited to produce an image. The metric predicts the perceptual importances of the computationally expensive indirect illumination components with respect to image quality. To develop the metric we conducted a series of psychophysical experiments in which we measured and modeled the perceptual importances of the components. An important property of this new metric is that it predicts component importances from inexpensive estimates of the reflectance properties of a scene, and therefore adds negligible overhead to the rendering process. This perceptual metric should enable the development of an important new class of efficient global-illumination rendering systems that can intelligently allocate limited computational resources, to provide high quality images at interactive rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15460","fieldValue":"Perceptual illumination components: a new approach to efficient, high quality global illumination rendering"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15460","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15460","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15461","fieldValue":" Level of detail (LOD) is widely used to control visual feedback in interactive applications. LOD control is typically based on perception at threshold -- the conditions in which a stimulus first becomes perceivable. Yet most LOD manipulations are quite perceivable and occur well above threshold. Moreover, research shows that supra-threshold perception differs drastically from perception at threshold. In that case, should supra-threshold LOD control also differ from LOD control at threshold?In two experiments, we examine supra-threshold LOD control in the visual periphery and find that indeed, it should differ drastically from LOD control at threshold. Specifically, we find that LOD must support a task-dependent level of reliable perceptibility. Above that level, perceptibility of LOD control manipulations should be minimized, and detail contrast is a better predictor of perceptibility than detail size. Below that level, perceptibility must be maximized, and LOD should be improved as eccentricity rises or contrast drops. This directly contradicts prevailing threshold-based LOD control schemes, and strongly suggests a reexamination of LOD control for foveal display."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15461","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15461","fieldValue":"ACM"}
