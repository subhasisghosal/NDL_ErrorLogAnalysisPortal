It involves building classifiers capable of detecting human emotions for a specific application, for example, analyzing reactions to product launches, monitoring emotions at sports events, or discerning opinions in political debates. Most successful approaches rely heavily on costly manual annotation. To alleviate this burden, we propose a distant supervision methodâ\u20AC\u201DDystemoâ\u20AC\u201Dfor automatically producing emotion classifiers from tweets labeled using existing or easy-to-produce emotion lexicons. The goal is to obtain emotion classifiers that work more accurately for specific applications than available emotion lexicons. The success of this method depends mainly on a novel classifierâ\u20AC\u201DBalanced Weighted Voting (BWV)â\u20AC\u201Ddesigned to overcome the imbalance in emotion distribution in the initial dataset, and on novel heuristics for detecting neutral tweets. We demonstrate how Dystemo works using Twitter data about sports events, a fine-grained 20-category emotion model, and three different initial emotion lexicons. Through a series of carefully designed experiments, we confirm that Dystemo is effective both in extending initial emotion lexicons of small coverage to find correctly more emotional tweets and in correcting emotion lexicons of low accuracy to perform more accurately."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7748","fieldValue":" Customer segmentation is one of the most traditional and valued tasks in customer relationship management (CRM). In this article, we explore the problem in the context of the car insurance industry, where the mobility behavior of customers plays a key role: Different mobility needs, driving habits, and skills imply also different requirements (level of coverage provided by the insurance) and risks (of accidents). In the present work, we describe a methodology to extract several indicators describing the driving profile of customers, and we provide a clustering-oriented instantiation of the segmentation problem based on such indicators. Then, we consider the availability of a continuous flow of fresh mobility data sent by the circulating vehicles, aiming at keeping our segments constantly up to date. We tackle a major scalability issue that emerges in this context when the number of customers is largeâ\u20AC\u201Dnamely, the communication bottleneckâ\u20AC\u201Dby proposing and implementing a sophisticated distributed monitoring solution that reduces communications between vehicles and company servers to the essential. We validate the framework on a large database of real mobility data coming from GPS devices on private cars. Finally, we analyze the privacy risks that the proposed approach might involve for the users, providing and evaluating a countermeasure based on data perturbation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7749","fieldValue":"Hoi, Steven C H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7749","fieldValue":" Online learning plays an important role in many big data mining problems because of its high efficiency and scalability. In the literature, many online learning algorithms using gradient information have been applied to solve online classification problems. Recently, more effective second-order algorithms have been proposed, where the correlation between the features is utilized to improve the learning efficiency. Among them, Confidence-Weighted (CW) learning algorithms are very effective, which assume that the classification model is drawn from a Gaussian distribution, which enables the model to be effectively updated with the second-order information of the data stream. Despite being studied actively, these CW algorithms cannot handle nonseparable datasets and noisy datasets very well. In this article, we propose a family of Soft Confidence-Weighted (SCW) learning algorithms for both binary classification and multiclass classification tasks, which is the first family of online classification algorithms that enjoys four salient properties simultaneously: (1) large margin training, (2) confidence weighting, (3) capability to handle nonseparable data, and (4) adaptive margin. Our experimental results show that the proposed SCW algorithms significantly outperform the original CW algorithm. When comparing with a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms (including AROW, NAROW, and NHERD), we found that SCW in general achieves better or at least comparable predictive performance, but enjoys considerably better efficiency advantage (i.e., using a smaller number of updates and lower time cost).
