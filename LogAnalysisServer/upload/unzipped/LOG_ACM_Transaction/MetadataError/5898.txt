Experiment 1 measures perceived cognitive workload and search times for short words with two banners on the screen. Four kinds of banners were examined: (1) animated commercial, (2) static commercial, (3) cyan with flashing text, and (4) blank. Using NASA's Task Load Index, participants report increased workload under flashing text banners. Experiment 2 investigates search through news headlines at two levels of difficulty: exact matches and matches requiring semantic interpretation. Results show both animated and static commercial banners decrease visual search speeds. Eye tracking data reveal people rarely look directly at banners. A post hoc memory test confirms low banner recall and, surprisingly, that animated banners are more difficult to remember than static look-alikes. Results have implications for cognitive modeling and Web design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5659","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5659","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5660","fieldValue":" Context-aware computing exposes a unique tension in how information about human context is modeled and used. On the one hand, approaches that use loosely structured information have been shown to be useful in situations where humans are the final consumers of contextual information; these approaches have found favor in many CSCW applications. On the other hand, more rigidly structured information supports machine interpretation and exchange; these approaches have been explored in the ubiquitous computing community. The system presented here, dë¯­ Intermezzo, represents an exploration of a space between these two extremes. Intermezzo combines a loose data structuring with a number of unique features designed to allow applications to embed specialized semantic interpretations of data into the infrastructure, allowing them to be reused by other applications. This approach can enable the construction of applications that can take advantage of rich, layered interpretations of context without requiring that they understand all aspects of that context. This approach is explored through the creation of two higher-level services that provide context-enhanced session management and context-enhanced access control."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5660","fieldValue":"Putting computing in context: An infrastructure to support extensible context-enhanced collaborative applications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5660","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5660","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5661","fieldValue":" Always-on video provides rich awareness for distance-separated coworkers. Yet video can threaten privacy, especially when it captures telecommuters working at home. We evaluated video blurring, an image masking method long touted to balance privacy and awareness. Results show that video blurring is unable to balance privacy with awareness for risky situations. Reactions by participants suggest that other popular image masking techniques will be problematic as well. The design implication is that image masking techniques will not suffice for privacy protection in video-based telecommuting situations. Other context-aware privacy-protecting strategies are required, as illustrated in our prototype context-aware home media space."}
