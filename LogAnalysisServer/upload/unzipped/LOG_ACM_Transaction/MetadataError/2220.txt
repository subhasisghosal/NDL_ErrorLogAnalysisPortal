We demonstrate that such irregularities and aberrations, when properly applied, can improve the quality and usability of light field cameras. Examples include spherical aberrations for the mainlens, and misaligned sampling patterns for the microlens and photosensor elements. These observations are a natural consequence of a key difference between conventional and light field cameras: optimizing for a single captured 2D image versus a range of reprojected 2D images from a captured 4D light field. We propose designs in mainlens aberrations and microlens\/photosensor sample patterns, and evaluate them through simulated measurements and captured results with our hardware prototype."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17401","fieldValue":"McDowall, Ian"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17401","fieldValue":" Fundamental display characteristics are constantly being improved, especially resolution, dynamic range, and color reproduction. However, whereas high resolution and high-dynamic range displays have matured as a technology, it remains largely unclear how to extend the color gamut of a display without either sacrificing light throughput or making other tradeoffs. In this paper, we advocate for adaptive color display; with hardware implementations that allow for color primaries to be dynamically chosen, an optimal gamut and corresponding pixel states can be computed in a content-adaptive and user-centric manner. We build a flexible gamut projector and develop a perceptually-driven optimization framework that robustly factors a wide color gamut target image into a set of time-multiplexed primaries and corresponding pixel values. We demonstrate that adaptive primary selection has many benefits over fixed gamut selection and show that our algorithm for joint primary selection and gamut mapping performs better than existing methods. Finally, we evaluate the proposed computational display system extensively in simulation and, via photographs and user experiments, with a prototype adaptive color projector."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17401","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17401","fieldValue":"ACM"}
