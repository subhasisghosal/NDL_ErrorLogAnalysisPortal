All past protocols for asynchronous Byzantine agreement had been exponential, and no protocol for asynchronous leader election had been known. Our protocols tolerate up to (1\/3 âˆ\u2019 &epsis;) á¹¡ n faulty processors, for any positive constant &epsis;. They are Monte Carlo, sì³®ding with probability 1 âˆ\u2019 o(1) for Byzantine agreement, and constant probability for leader election. A key technical contribution of our article is a new approach for emulating Feige's lightest bin protocol, even with adversarial message scheduling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2459","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2459","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15397","fieldValue":" A typical NURBS surface model has a large percentage of superfluous control points that significantly interfere with the design process. This paper presents an algorithm for eliminating such superfluous control points, producing a T-spline. The algorithm can remove substantially more control points than competing methods such as B-spline wavelet decomposition. The paper also presents a new T-spline local refinement algorithm and answers two fundamental open questions on T-spline theory."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15398","fieldValue":" Variational interpolation in curved geometries has many applications, so there has always been demand for geometrically meaningful and efficiently computable splines in manifolds. We extend the definition of the familiar cubic spline curves and splines in tension, and we show how to compute these on parametric surfaces, level sets, triangle meshes, and point samples of surfaces. This list is more comprehensive than it looks, because it includes variational motion design for animation, and allows the treatment of obstacles via barrier surfaces. All these instances of the general concept are handled by the same geometric optimization algorithm, which minimizes an energy of curves on surfaces of arbitrary dimension and codimension."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15398","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15398","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15399","fieldValue":" We describe an interactive, computer-assisted framework for combining parts of a set of photographs into a single composite picture, a process we call \"digital photomontage.\" Our framework makes use of two techniques primarily: graph-cut optimization, to choose good seams within the constituent images so that they can be combined as seamlessly as possible; and gradient-domain fusion, a process based on Poisson equations, to further reduce any remaining visible artifacts in the composite. Also central to the framework is a suite of interactive tools that allow the user to specify a variety of high-level image objectives, either globally across the image, or locally through a painting-style interface. Image objectives are applied independently at each pixel location and generally involve a function of the pixel values (such as \"maximum contrast\") drawn from that same location in the set of source images. Typically, a user applies a series of image objectives iteratively in order to create a finished composite. The power of this framework lies in its generality; we show how it can be used for a wide variety of applications, including \"selective composites\" (for instance, group photos in which everyone looks their best), relighting, extended depth of field, panoramic stitching, clean-plate production, stroboscopic visualization of movement, and time-lapse mosaics."}
