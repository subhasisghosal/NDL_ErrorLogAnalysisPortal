Social Networks and Online Communities enable interaction with complete strangers, and open up new commercial, political, and social possibilities. But those promises are rarely achieved because it is difficult to trust the online contacts. A common approach to remedy this problem is to compute trust values for the new contacts from the existing trust values in the network. There are two main methods: aggregation and transitivity. Yet, neither method provides satisfactory results because trust networks are sparse and transitivity may not hold. This article develops a Bayesian formulation of the problem, where trust is defined as a conditional probability, and a Bayesian Network analysis is employed to compute the unknown trust values in terms of the known trust values. The algorithms used to propagate conditional probabilities through the network are theoretically sound and based on a long-standing literature on probability propagation in Bayesian networks. Moreover, the context information that is typically ignored in trust literature is included here as a major factor in computing new trust values. These changes have led to significant improvements over existing approaches in the accuracy of computed trust, and with some modifications to the algorithm, in its reach. Real data acquired from Advogato network is used to do extensive testing, and the results confirm the practical value of a theoretically sound Bayesian approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8188","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8188","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8189","fieldValue":"Zeng, Daniel D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8189","fieldValue":" Social tagging, as a novel approach to information organization and discovery, has been widely adopted in many Web 2.0 applications. Tags contributed by users to annotate a variety of Web resources or items provide a new type of information that can be exploited by recommender systems. Nevertheless, the sparsity of the ternary interaction data among users, items, and tags limits the performance of tag-based recommendation algorithms. In this article, we propose to deal with the sparsity problem in social tagging by applying random walks on ternary interaction graphs to explore transitive associations between users and items. The transitive associations in this article refer to the path of the link between any two nodes whose length is greater than one. Taking advantage of these transitive associations can allow more accurate measurement of the relevance between two entities (e.g., user-item, user-user, and item-item). A PageRank-like algorithm has been developed to explore these transitive associations by spreading usersâ\u20AC™ preferences on an item similarity graph and spreading itemsâ\u20AC™ influences on a user similarity graph. Empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that our approach can effectively alleviate the sparsity problem and improve the quality of item recommendation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8189","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8189","fieldValue":"ACM"}
