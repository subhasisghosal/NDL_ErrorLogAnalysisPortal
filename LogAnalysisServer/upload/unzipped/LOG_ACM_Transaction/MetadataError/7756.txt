{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1939","fieldValue":" With continued process scaling, the rate of hardware failures in commodity systems is increasing. Because these commodity systems are highly sensitive to cost, traditional solutions that employ heavy redundancy to handle such failures are no longer acceptable owing to their high associated costs. Detecting such faults by identifying anomalous software execution and recovering through checkpoint-and-replay is emerging as a viable low-cost alternative for future commodity systems. An important but commonly ignored aspect of such solutions is ensuring that external outputs to the system are fault-free. The outputs must be delayed until the detectors guarantee this, influencing fault-free performance. The overheads for resiliency must thus be evaluated while taking these delays into consideration; prior work has largely ignored this relationship. This article concerns recovery for I\/O intensive applications from in-core faults. We present a strategy to buffer external outputs using dedicated hardware and show that checkpoint intervals previously considered as acceptable incur exorbitant overheads when hardware buffering is considered. We then present two techniques to reduce the checkpoint interval and demonstrate a practical solution that provides high resiliency while incurring low overheads."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1939","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1939","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10324","fieldValue":" Multicast benefits group communications in saving network traffic and improving application throughput, both of which are important for data center applications. However, the technical trend of data center design poses new challenges for efficient and scalable multicast routing. First, the densely connected networks make traditional receiver-driven multicast routing protocols inefficient in multicast tree formation. Second, it is quite difficult for the low-end switches widely used in data centers to hold the routing entries of massive multicast groups. In this paper, we propose ESM, an efficient and scalable multicast routing scheme for data center networks. ESM addresses the challenges above by exploiting the feature of modern data center networks. Based on the regular topology of data centers, ESM uses a source-to-receiver expansion approach to build efficient multicast trees, excluding many unnecessary intermediate switches used in receiver-driven multicast routing. For scalable multicast routing, ESM combines both in-packet Bloom Filters and in-switch entries to make the tradeoff between the number of multicast groups supported and the additional bandwidth overhead. Simulations show that ESM saves 40% - 50% network traffic and doubles the application throughputs compared to receiver-driven multicast routing, and the combination routing scheme significantly reduces the number of in-switch entries required. We implement ESM on a Linux platform. The experimental results further demonstrate that ESM can well support online tree building for large-scale groups with churns, and the overhead of the combination forwarding engine is light-weighted."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10324","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10325","fieldValue":" Vehicular Internet access via open WiFi access points (APs) has been demonstrated to be a feasible solution to provide opportunistic data service to moving vehicles. Using an in situ deployment, however, such a solution does not provide performance guarantees due to unpredictable intermittent connectivity. On the other hand, a solution that tries to cover every point in an entire road network with APs (a full coverage) is not very practical due to prohibitive deployment and operational costs. In this paper, we introduce a new notion of intermittent coverage for mobile users, called Alpha Coverage, which provides worst-case guarantees on the interconnection gap, i.e., the distance or expected delay between two consecutive mobile-AP contacts for a vehicle, while using significantly fewer APs than needed for full coverage. We propose efficient algorithms to verify whether a given deployment provides Alpha Coverage. The problem of finding an economic deployment that provides Î±-coverage turns out to be NP-hard. We hence provide both approximation algorithms that have provable guarantees on the performance as well as efficient heuristics that perform well in practice. The efficiency of our algorithms is demonstrated via simulations using data from real-world road networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10325","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10325","fieldValue":"ACM"}
