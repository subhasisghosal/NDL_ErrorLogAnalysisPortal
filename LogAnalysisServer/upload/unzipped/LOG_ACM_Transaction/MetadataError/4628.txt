{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24963","fieldValue":" Switched Processing Systems (SPS) serve as canonical models in a wide area of applications such as high performance computing, wireless networking, call centers, and flexible manufacturing. In this article, we model the SPS by considering both slotted and continuous time and analyze it under fairly mild stochastic assumptions. Two classes of scheduling policies are introduced and shown to maximize the throughput and maintain strong stability of the system. In addition, their performance with respect to the average job sojourn time is examined by simulating small SPS subject to different types of input traffic. By utilizing the simulation result of the proposed policies, a hybrid control policy is constructed to reduce the average job sojourn time when the system has unknown and changing input loads."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24963","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24963","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3415","fieldValue":"Jacobs, Richard H A H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3415","fieldValue":" Texture is extensively used in areas such as product design and architecture to convey specific aesthetic information. Using the results of a psychological experiment, we model the relationship between computational texture features and aesthetic properties of visual textures. Contrary to previous approaches, we build a layered model, which provides insights into hierarchical relationships involved in human aesthetic texture perception. This model uses a set of intermediate judgements to link computational texture features with aesthetic texture properties. We pursue two different approaches for modeling. (1) Supervised machine-learning methods are used to generate linear and nonlinear models from the experimental data automatically. The quality of these models is discussed, mainly focusing on interpretability and accuracy. (2) We apply a psychological-based approach that models the processing pathways in human perception of naturalness, introducing judgement dimensions (principal components) mediating the relationship between texture features and naturalness judgements. This multiple mediator model serves as a verification of the machine-learning approach. We conclude with a comparison of these two approaches, highlighting the similarities and discrepancies in terms of identified relationships between computational texture features and aesthetic properties of visual textures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24964","fieldValue":"Taylor, Simon J E"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24964","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24964","fieldValue":"ACM"}
