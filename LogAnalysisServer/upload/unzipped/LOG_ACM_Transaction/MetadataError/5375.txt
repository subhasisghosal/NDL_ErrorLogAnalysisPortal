Studies analyzing similar samples often report poorly overlapping results, and the p-value usually lacks biological context. We propose a nonparametric ReDiscovery Curve (RDCurve) method, to estimate the frequency of rediscovery of gene signature identified. Given a ranking procedure and a data set with replicated measurements, the RDCurve bootstraps the data set and repeatedly applies the ranking procedure, selects a subset of k important genes, and estimates the probability of rediscovery of the selected subset of genes. We also propose a permutation scheme to estimate the confidence band under the Null hypothesis for the significance of the RDCurve. The method is nonparametric and model-independent. With the RDCurve, we can assess the signal-to-noise ratio of the data, compare the performance of ranking procedures in term of their expected rediscovery rates, and choose the number of genes to be reported."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4530","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4531","fieldValue":" Ribonucleic acid (RNA), a single-stranded linear molecule, is essential to all biological systems. Different regions of the same RNA strand will fold together via base pair interactions to make intricate secondary and tertiary structures that guide crucial homeostatic processes in living organisms. Since the structure of RNA molecules is the key to their function, algorithms for the prediction of RNA structure are of great value. In this article, we demonstrate the usefulness of SARNA{\\hbox{-}}Predict, an RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm based on Simulated Annealing (SA). A performance evaluation of SARNA{\\hbox{-}}Predict in terms of prediction accuracy is made via comparison with eight state-of-the-art RNA prediction algorithms: mfold, Pseudoknot (pknotsRE), NUPACK, pknotsRG{\\hbox{-}}mfe, Sfold, HotKnots, ILM, and STAR. These algorithms are from three different classes: heuristic,dynamic programming, and statistical sampling techniques. An evaluation for the performance of SARNA{\\hbox{-}}Predict in terms of prediction accuracy was verified with native structures. Experiments on 33 individual known structures from eleven RNA classes (tRNA, viral RNA, antigenomic HDV, telomerase RNA, tmRNA, rRNA, RNaseP, 5S rRNA, Group I intron 23S rRNA, Group I intron 16S rRNA, and 16S rRNA) were performed. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that SARNA{\\hbox{-}}Predict can out-perform other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, there is substantial improvement of prediction accuracy by incorporating a more sophisticated thermodynamic model (efn2)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4531","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4531","fieldValue":"SARNA-Predict: Accuracy Improvement of RNA Secondary Structure Prediction Using Permutation-Based Simulated Annealing"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4531","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4531","fieldValue":"ACM"}
