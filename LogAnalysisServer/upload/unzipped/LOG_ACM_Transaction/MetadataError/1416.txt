The display acts as a physical window into 3D virtual environments, through which a one-to-one mapping between real and virtual space is preserved. The Boom Chameleon is further augmented with a touch-screen and a microphone\/speaker combination. We created a 3D annotation application that exploits this unique configuration in order to simultaneously capture viewpoint, voice and gesture information. Results of an informal user study show that the Boom Chameleon annotation facilities have the potential to be an effective, and intuitive system for reviewing 3D designs."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15351","fieldValue":"Boom chameleon: simultaneous capture of 3D viewpoint, voice and gesture annotations on a spatially-aware display"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15352","fieldValue":" The Actuated Workbench is a device that uses magnetic forces to move objects on a table in two dimensions.
