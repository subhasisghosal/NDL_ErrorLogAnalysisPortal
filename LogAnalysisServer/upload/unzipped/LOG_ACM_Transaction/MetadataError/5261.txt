However, elucidating the mechanism that confers power to spaced seeds and characterizing optimal spaced seeds still remain unsolved. This paper investigates these two important open questions by formally analyzing the average number of non-overlapping hits and the hit probability of a spaced seed in the Bernoulli sequence model. We prove that when the length of a non-uniformly spaced seed is bounded above by an exponential function of the seed weight, the seed outperforms strictly the traditional consecutive seed of the same weight in both (i) the average number of non-overlapping hits and (ii) the asymptotic hit probability. This clearly answers the first problem mentioned above in the Bernoulli sequence model. The theoretical study in this paper also gives a new solution to finding long optimal seeds."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4313","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4313","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4313","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4314","fieldValue":" Tree shape statistics quantify some aspect of the shape of a phylogenetic tree. They are commonly used to compare reconstructed trees to evolutionary models and to find evidence of tree reconstruction bias. Historically, to find a useful tree shape statistic, formulas have been invented by hand and then evaluated for utility. This article presents the first method which is capable of optimizing over a class of tree shape statistics, called Binary Recursive Tree Shape Statistics (BRTSS). After defining the BRTSS class, a set of algebraic expressions is defined which can be used in the recursions. The tree shape statistics definable using these expressions in the BRTSS is very general, and includes many of the statistics with which phylogenetic researchers are already familiar. We then present a practical genetic algorithm which is capable of performing optimization over BRTSS given any objective function. The chapter concludes with a successful application of the methods to find a new statistic which indicates a significant difference between two distributions on trees which were previously postulated to have similar properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4314","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
