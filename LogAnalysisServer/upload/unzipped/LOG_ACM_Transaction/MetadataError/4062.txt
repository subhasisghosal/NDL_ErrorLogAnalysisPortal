When documents are dynamically updated in a distributed fashion, information content among different language editions may gradually diverge. We propose a framework for assisting human editors to manage this information disparity, using tools from machine translation and machine learning. Given source and target documents in two different languages, our system automatically identifies information nuggets that are new with respect to the target and suggests positions to place their translations. We perform both real-world experiments and large-scale simulations on Wikipedia documents and conclude our system is effective in a variety of scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/23080","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442076.2442077\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23080","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23080","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23081","fieldValue":" The TAC 2010 summarization track initiated a new taskâ\u20AC\u201Daspect-guided summarizationâ\u20AC\u201Dthat centers on textual aspects embodied as particular kinds of information of a text. We observe that aspect-guided summaries not only address highly specific user need, but also facilitate content-level coherence by using aspect information. In this article, we present a full-fledged approach to aspect-guided summarization with a focus on summary coherence. Our summarization approach depends on two prerequisite subtasks: recognizing aspect-bearing sentences in order to do sentence extraction, and modeling aspect-based coherence with an HMM model in order to predict a coherent sentence ordering. Using the manually annotated TAC 2010 and 2010 datasets, we validated the effectiveness of our proposed methods for those subtasks. Drawing on the empirical results, we proceed to develop an aspect-guided summarizer based on a simple but robust base summarizer. With sentence selection guided by aspect information, our system is one of the best on TAC 2011. With sentence ordering predicted by the aspect-based HMM model, the summaries achieve good coherence."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/23081","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442076.2442078\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23081","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23081","fieldValue":"ACM"}
