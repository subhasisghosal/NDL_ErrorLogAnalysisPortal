As a form of User Generated Content (UGC), gamecasts play an important role in user entertainment and gamer education. They deserve the attention of both industrial partners and the academic communities, corresponding to the large amount of revenue involved and the interesting research problems associated with UGC sites and social networks. Although previous work has put much effort into analyzing general UGC sites such as YouTube, relatively little is known about the gamecast sharing sites. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive study of gamecast sharing sites, including commercial streaming-based sites such as Amazonâ\u20AC™s Twitch.tv and community-maintained replay-based sites such as WoTreplays. We collect and share a novel dataset on WoTreplays that includes more than 380,000 game replays, shared by more than 60,000 creators with more than 1.9 million gamers. Together with an earlier published dataset on Twitch.tv, we investigate basic characteristics of gamecast sharing sites, and we analyze the activities of their creators and spectators. Among our results, we find that (i) WoTreplays and Twitch.tv are both fast-consumed repositories, with millions of gamecasts being uploaded, viewed, and soon forgotten; (ii) both the gamecasts and the creators exhibit highly skewed popularity, with a significant heavy tail phenomenon; and (iii) the upload and download preferences of creators and spectators are different: while the creators emphasize their individual skills, the spectators appreciate team-wise tactics. Our findings provide important knowledge for infrastructure and service improvement, for example, in the design of proper resource allocation mechanisms that consider future gamecasting and in the tuning of incentive policies that further help player retention."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25746","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25746","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25747","fieldValue":" With the huge advance in Internet technology as well as the availability of low-cost 3D display devices, 3D image transmission has become popular in recent times. Since watermarking has become regarded as a potential Digital Rights Management (DRM) tools in the past decade, 3D image watermarking is an emerging research topic. With the introduction of the Depth Image-Based Rendering (DIBR) technique, 3D image watermarking is a more challenging task, especially for synthetic view generation. In this article, synthetic view generation is regarded as a potential attack, and a blind watermarking scheme is proposed that can resist it. In the proposed scheme, the watermark is embedded into the low-pass filtered dependent view region of 3D images. Block Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) is used for spatial-filtration of the dependent view region to find the DC coefficient with horizontally shifted coherent regions from the left and right view to make the scheme robust against synthesis view attack. A comprehensive set of experiments have been carried out to justify the robustness of the proposed scheme over related existing schemes with respect to Stereo JPEG compression and different noise addition attacks."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25747","fieldValue":"3D"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25747","fieldValue":"DIBR"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25748","fieldValue":"Silva, Bruno M C"}
