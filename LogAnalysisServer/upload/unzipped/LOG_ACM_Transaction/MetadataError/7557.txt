{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9921","fieldValue":" The scheduling problem in multi-hop wireless networks has been extensively investigated. Although throughput optimal scheduling solutions have been developed in the literature, they are unsuitable for multi-hop wireless systems because they are usually centralized and have very high complexity. In this paper, we develop a random-access based scheduling scheme that utilizes local information. The important features of this scheme include constant-time complexity, distributed operations, and a provable performance guarantee. Analytical results show that it guarantees a larger fraction of the optimal throughput performance than the state-of-the-art. Through simulations with both single-hop and multi-hop traffics, we observe that the scheme provides high throughput, close to that of a well-known highly efficient centralized greedy solution called the Greedy Maximal Scheduler."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9921","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9922","fieldValue":" The scenario of distributed data aggregation in wireless sensor networks is considered, where sensors can obtain and estimate the information of the whole sensing field through local data exchange and aggregation. An intrinsic tradeoff between energy and aggregation delay is identified, where nodes must decide optimal instants for forwarding samples. The samples could be from a node's own sensor readings or an aggregation with samples forwarded from neighboring nodes. By considering the randomness of the sample arrival instants and the uncertainty of the availability of the multiaccess communication channel, a sequential decision process model is proposed to analyze this problem and determine optimal decision policies with local information. It is shown that, once the statistics of the sample arrival and the availability of the channel satisfy certain conditions, there exist optimal control-limit-type policies that are easy to implement in practice. In the case that the required conditions are not satisfied, the performance loss of using the proposed control-limit-type policies is characterized. In general cases, a finite-state approximation is proposed and two on-line algorithms are provided to solve it. Practical distributed data aggregation simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed policies, which also achieve a desired energy-delay tradeoff."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9922","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9922","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9922","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9923","fieldValue":" We study sleep\/wake scheduling for low-duty cycle sensor networks. Our work explicitly considers the effect of synchronization error. We focus on a widely used synchronization scheme and show that its synchronization error is nonnegligible and using a conservative guard time is energy wasteful. We formulate an optimization problem that aims to set the capture probability threshold for messages from each individual node such that the expected energy consumption is minimized, and the collective quality of service (QoS) over the nodes is guaranteed. The problem is nonconvex. Nonetheless, we are able to obtain a solution with energy consumption that is provably at most 37% larger than the optimal solution.
