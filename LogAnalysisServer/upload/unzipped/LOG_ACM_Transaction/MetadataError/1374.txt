To enable the use of surface light fields in real-time rendering we develop a compact representation suitable for an accelerated graphics pipeline. We propose to approximate the light field data by partitioning it over elementary surface primitives and factorizing each part into a small set of lower-dimensional functions. We show that our representation can be further compressed using standard image compression techniques leading to extremely compact data sets that are up to four orders of magnitude smaller than the input data. Finally, we develop an image-based rendering method, light field mapping, that can visualize surface light fields directly from this compact representation at interactive frame rates on a personal computer. We also implement a new method of approximating the light field data that produces positive only factors allowing for faster rendering using simpler graphics hardware than earlier methods. We demonstrate the results for a variety of non-trivial synthetic scenes and physical objects scanned through 3D photography."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15238","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15238","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15239","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15239","fieldValue":" We present a feature-based technique for morphing 3D objects represented by light fields. Our technique enables morphing of image-based objects whose geometry and surface properties are too difficult to model with traditional vision and graphics techniques. Light field morphing is not based on 3D reconstruction; instead it relies on ray correspondence, i.e., the correspondence between rays of the source and target light fields. We address two main issues in light field morphing: feature specification and visibility changes. For feature specification, we develop an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface (UI). The key to this UI is feature polygons, which are intuitively specified as 3D polygons and are used as a control mechanism for ray correspondence in the abstract 4D ray space. For handling visibility changes due to object shape changes, we introduce ray-space warping. Ray-space warping can fill arbitrarily large holes caused by object shape changes; these holes are usually too large to be properly handled by traditional image warping. Our method can deal with non-Lambertian surfaces, including specular surfaces (with dense light fields). We demonstrate that light field morphing is an effective and easy-to-use technqiue that can generate convincing 3D morphing effects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15239","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15239","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15240","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15240","fieldValue":" In this paper, we describe a novel technique, called motion texture, for synthesizing complex human-figure motion (e.g., dancing) that is statistically similar to the original motion captured data. We define motion texture as a set of motion textons and their distribution, which characterize the stochastic and dynamic nature of the captured motion. Specifically, a motion texton is modeled by a linear dynamic system (LDS) while the texton distribution is represented by a transition matrix indicating how likely each texton is switched to another. We have designed a maximum likelihood algorithm to learn the motion textons and their relationship from the captured dance motion. The learnt motion texture can then be used to generate new animations automatically and\/or edit animation sequences interactively. Most interestingly, motion texture can be manipulated at different levels, either by changing the fine details of a specific motion at the texton level or by designing a new choreography at the distribution level. Our approach is demonstrated by many synthesized sequences of visually compelling dance motion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15240","fieldValue":"ACM"}
