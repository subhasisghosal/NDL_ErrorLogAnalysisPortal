Towards this challenge, we propose a control-theoretic design methodology that permits a system designer to specify a set of hard real-time performance modes under which the system may operate. The system automatically adjusts the real-time performance mode based on the external thermal stress. We show (via analysis, simulations, and a hardware testbed implementation) that our control design framework is stable and control performance is equivalent to previous real-time thermal approaches, even under dynamic temperature changes. A crucial and novel advantage of our framework over previous real-time control is the ability to guarantee hard deadlines even under transitions between modes. Furthermore, our system design permits the calculation of a new metric called thermal resiliency that characterizes the maximum external thermal stress that any hard real-time performance mode can withstand. Thus, our design framework and analysis may be classified as a thermal stress analysis for real-time systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6861","fieldValue":"EDF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6862","fieldValue":" With the rapid growth of complex hardware features, timing analysis has become an increasingly difficult problem. The key to solving this problem lies in the precise and scalable modeling of performance-enhancing processor features (e.g., cache). Moreover, real-time systems are often multitasking and use preemptive scheduling, with fixed or dynamic priority assignment. For such systems, cache related preemption delay (CRPD) may increase the execution time of a task. Therefore, CRPD may affect the overall schedulability analysis. Existing works propose to bound the value of CRPD in a single-level cache. In this article, we propose a CRPD analysis framework that can be used for a two-level, noninclusive cache hierarchy. In addition, our proposed framework is also applicable in the presence of shared caches. We first show that CRPD analysis faces several new challenges in the presence of a multilevel, noninclusive cache hierarchy. Our proposed framework overcomes all such challenges and we can formally prove the correctness of our framework. We have performed experiments with several subject programs, including an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) controller and an in-situ space debris monitoring instrument. Our experimental results suggest that we can provide sound and precise CRPD estimates using our framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6862","fieldValue":"WCET"}
