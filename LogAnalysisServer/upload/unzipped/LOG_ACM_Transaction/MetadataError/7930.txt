A distinguishing feature of wireless sensors is the need to perform both source coding tasks, such as measurement and compression, and transmission tasks. It is known that the overall energy consumption for source coding is generally comparable to that of transmission, and that a joint design of the two classes of tasks can lead to relevant performance gains. Moreover, the efficiency of source coding in a sensor network can be potentially improved via distributed techniques by leveraging the fact that signals measured by different nodes are correlated. In this paper, a data-gathering protocol for multihop wireless sensor networks with energy-harvesting capabilities is studied whereby the sources measured by the sensors are correlated. Both the energy consumptions of source coding and transmission are modeled, and distributed source coding is assumed. The problem of dynamically and jointly optimizing the source coding and transmission strategies is formulated for time-varying channels and sources. The problem consists in the minimization of a cost function of the distortions in the source reconstructions at the sink under queue stability constraints. By adopting perturbation-based Lyapunov techniques, a close-to-optimal online scheme is proposed that has an explicit and controllable tradeoff between optimality gap and queue sizes. The role of side information available at the sink is also discussed under the assumption that acquiring the side information entails an energy cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10675","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10675","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10675","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10676","fieldValue":" Though the widely used Tor anonymity network is designed to enable low-latency anonymous communication, interactive communications on Tor incur latencies over 5 greater than on the direct Internet path, and in many cases, autonomous systems (ASs) can compromise anonymity via correlations of network traffic. In this paper, we develop LASTor, a new Tor client that addresses these shortcomings in Tor with only client-side modifications. First, LASTor improves communication latencies by accounting for the inferred locations of Tor relays while choosing paths. Since the preference for shorter paths reduces the entropy of path selection, we design LASTor so that a user can choose an appropriate tradeoff between latency and anonymity. Second, we develop an efficient and accurate algorithm to identify paths on which an AS can compromise anonymity by traffic correlation. LASTor avoids such paths to improve a user's anonymity, and the low run-time of the algorithm ensures that the impact on end-to-end communication latencies is low. Our results show that, in comparison to the default Tor client, LASTor reduces median latencies by 25% while also reducing the false negative rate of not detecting a potential snooping AS from 57% to 11%."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10676","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10677","fieldValue":" This paper addresses fundamental issues in a shared channel where the users have different priority levels. In particular, we study a two-user cognitive shared channel consisting of a primary (higher-priority) and a secondary user, operating in the cognitive underlay fashion, but in a novel way where interference suffered by the primary user is compensated by requiring the secondary user to cooperatively relay some of the primary's packets. We start by analyzing the case of no node cooperation, where nodes transmit their own packets to their respective destinations. We then extend the analysis to a system in which the secondary node acts as a relay for the primary user, in addition to serving its own packets. Specifically, in the cognitive cooperation case, the secondary node forwards those packets to the primary destination that it receives successfully from the primary source. In such cognitive shared channels, a tradeoff arises in terms of activating the secondary along with the primary so that both transmissions may be successful, but with a lower probability, compared to the case of the secondary node staying idle when the primary user transmits. Results show the benefits of relaying for both the primary as well as the secondary nodes in terms of the stable-throughput region."}
