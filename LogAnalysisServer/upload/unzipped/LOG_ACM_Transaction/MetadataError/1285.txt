An associated set of geometric algorithms operates successfully on degenerate and nearly degenerate geometry, and when necessary produces degenerate geometric results. Computation errors are interpreted geometrically in order to establish preconditions for reliable results and requirements on the resolution of computer arithmetic. The algorithms thus provide a basis for the wide range of geometric constructions required by computer-aided drafting and design systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15003","fieldValue":" A parallel fitting algorithm using uniform bicubic B-spline surfaces is presented. This algorithm is based on the observation that a tensor product spline surface fitting problem can be split into two spline curve fitting problems, and each of these problems can be carried out in parallel by cyclic reduction. Using this approach, the control points of a uniform bicubic B-spline surface that interpolates a grid of m x n points can be found in O(log m + log n) time on mn processors. Furthermore, since smaller systems of equations are solved in the algorithm, the accumulated error resulting from this approach is smaller than that of the traditional algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15004","fieldValue":" Solids defined by Boolean combinations of solid primitives may be represented in constructive solid geometry (CSG) as binary trees. Most CSG-based algorithms (e.g., for boundary evaluation, graphic shading, interference detection) do various forms of set-membership classification by traversing the tree associated with the solid. These algorithms usually generate intermediate results that do not contribute to the final result, and hence may be regarded as redundant and a source of inefficiency. To reduce such inefficiencies, we associate with each primitive A in a tree S an active zone Z that represents the region of space where changes to A affect the solid represented by S, and we use a representation of Z instead of S for set-membership classification. In the paper we develop a mathematical theory of active zones, prove that they correspond to the intersection of certain nodes of the original trees, and show how they lead to efficient new algorithms for boundary evaluation, for detecting and eliminating redundant nodes in CSG trees, for interference (null-set) detection, and for graphic shading."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15004","fieldValue":"Active zones in CSG for accelerating boundary evaluation, redundancy elimination, interference detection, and shading algorithms"}
