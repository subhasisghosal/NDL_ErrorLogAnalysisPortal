Previous emphasis in time management (TM) services has been based on time stamp ordering, which is both computation and bandwidth intensive. This article discusses an alternative approach to time management based on causal ordering. Traditional causal ordering protocols incur a large amount of communication overhead, which is generally of the order of $N^2$ for a distributed system of N processes. A new causal ordering protocol proposed by the authors, the Modified Schiper-Eggli-Sandoz (MSES) protocol, is presented in this article. This new protocol minimizes the control information overhead of causal ordering by using the direct dependency tracking technique. The MSES protocol works well in both unicast and multicast environments, without relying on information about the underlying network topology and communication pattern among the processes of the distributed system. The MSES protocol has been successfully implemented as a middleware on top of DMSO RTI. Experiments have been conducted to benchmark the performance of the new time management mechanism with respect to the existing TM mechanisms available in DMSO RTI. The simulation scenarios of the experiments vary with different degrees of inter-federate dependency and federate event granularities. The ordering limitations of the causality based TM mechanism are addressed in this article and the trade-off of the degree of event ordering and execution speed of simulations is discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24905","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24905","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24906","fieldValue":" Simulating continuous-time Markov reward processes containing rarely visited, but economically important states requires long simulation times unless special measures are taken. In this article, we consider Markov reward processes in equilibrium, and we use the equilibrium equations to reallocate rewards. The effect of this reallocation is determined analytically for a number of small examples. In these examples, significant savings in run lengths were possible, especially in the case where the expected rewards are strongly influenced by low-probability boundary states. The emphasis of the article is on exploration; no large simulation problems have been considered."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24906","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24906","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3409","fieldValue":" Motion blur is a frequent requirement for the rendering of high-quality animated images. However, the computational resources involved are usually higher than those for images that have not been temporally antialiased. In this article we study the influence of high-level properties such as object material and speed, shutter time, and antialiasing level. Based on scenes containing variations of these parameters, we design different psychophysical experiments to determine how influential they are in the perception of image quality. This work gives insights on the effects these parameters have and exposes certain situations where motion blurred stimuli may be indistinguishable from a gold standard. As an immediate practical application, images of similar quality can be produced while the computing requirements are reduced. Algorithmic efforts have traditionally been focused on finding new improved methods to alleviate sampling artifacts by steering computation to the most important dimensions of the rendering equation. Concurrently, rendering algorithms can take advantage of certain perceptual limits to simplify and optimize computations. To our knowledge, none of them has identified nor used these limits in the rendering of motion blur. This work can be considered a first step in that direction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3409","fieldValue":"ACM"}
