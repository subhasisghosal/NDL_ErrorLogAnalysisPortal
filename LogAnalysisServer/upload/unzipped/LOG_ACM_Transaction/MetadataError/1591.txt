We present a process called tracking, which takes as input a rough animation or simulation and enhances it with physically simulated detail. Building on the foundation of constrained Lagrangian mechanics, we propose weak-form constraints for tracking the input motion. This method allows the artist to choose where to add details such as characteristic wrinkles and folds of various thin shell materials and dynamical effects of physical forces. We demonstrate multiple applications ranging from enhancing an artist's animated character to guiding a simulated inanimate object."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15807","fieldValue":" We present a new image-based technique for enhancing the shape and surface details of an object. The input to our system is a small set of photographs taken from a fixed viewpoint, but under varying lighting conditions. For each image we compute a multiscale decomposition based on the bilateral filter and then reconstruct an enhanced image that combines detail information at each scale across all the input images. Our approach does not require any information about light source positions, or camera calibration, and can produce good results with 3 to 5 input images. In addition our system provides a few high-level parameters for controlling the amount of enhancement and does not require pixel-level user input. We show that the bilateral filter is a good choice for our multiscale algorithm because it avoids the halo artifacts commonly associated with the traditional Laplacian image pyramid. We also develop a new scheme for computing our multiscale bilateral decomposition that is simple to implement, fast $O(N^2$ log N) and accurate."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15807","fieldValue":"NPR"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15807","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15807","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15808","fieldValue":" We propose a novel post-production facial performance relighting system for human actors. Our system uses just a dataset of view-dependent facial appearances with a neutral expression, captured for a static subject using a Light Stage apparatus. For the actual performance, however, a potentially different actor is captured under known, but static, illumination. During post-production, the reflectance field of the reference dataset actor is transferred onto the dynamic performance, enabling image-based relighting of the entire sequence. Our approach makes post-production relighting more practical and could easily be incorporated in a traditional production pipeline since it does not require additional hardware during principal photography. Additionally, we show that our system is suitable for real-time post-production illumination editing."}
