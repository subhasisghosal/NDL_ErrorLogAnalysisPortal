Our decomposition, called a protrusion decomposition, is the cornerstone in obtaining the following two main results. Our first result is that any parameterized graph problem (with parameter k) that has a finite integer index and such that Yes-instances have a treewidth-modulator of size O(k) admits a linear kernel on the class of H-topological-minor-free graphs, for any fixed graph H. This result partially extends previous meta-theorems on the existence of linear kernels on graphs of bounded genus and H-minor-free graphs. Let F be a fixed finite family of graphs containing at least one planar graph. Given an n-vertex graph G and a non-negative integer k, Planar-F-Deletion asks whether G has a set XâŠ\u2020V(G) such that &verbar;X&verbar; &les; k and G âˆ\u2019 X is H-minor-free for every H &epsi; F. As our second application, we present the first single-exponential algorithm to solve Planar-F-Deletion. Namely, our algorithm runs in time $2^O(k) Â· n2$, which is asymptotically optimal with respect to k. So far, single-exponential algorithms were only known for special cases of the family F."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/18091","fieldValue":"Tran-Thong"}
