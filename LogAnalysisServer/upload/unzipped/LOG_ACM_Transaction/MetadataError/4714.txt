{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25170","fieldValue":" The on-chip communication in current Chip-MultiProcessors (CMP) and MultiProcessor-SoC (MPSoC) is mainly based on the Network-on-Chip (NoC) design paradigm. Unfortunately, it is foreseen that conventional NoC architectures cannot sustain the performance, power, and reliability requirements demanded by the next generation of manycore architectures. Recently, emerging on-chip communication technologies, like wireless Networks-on-Chip (WiNoCs), have been proposed as candidate solutions for addressing the scalability limitations of conventional multi-hop NoC architectures. In a WiNoC, a subset of network nodes are equipped with a wireless interface which allows them long-range communication in a single hop. Assessing the performance and power figures of NoC and WiNoC architectures requires the availability of simulation tools that are often limited on modeling specific network configurations. This article presents Noxim, an open, configurable, extendible, cycle-accurate NoC simulator developed in SystemC, which allows to analyze the performance and power figures of both conventional wired NoC and emerging WiNoC architectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25170","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25170","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25171","fieldValue":" When we use simulations to estimate the performance of stochastic systems, the simulation is often driven by input models estimated from finite real-world data. A complete statistical characterization of system performance estimates requires quantifying both input model and simulation estimation errors. The components of input models in many complex systems could be dependent. In this paper, we represent the distribution of a random vector by its marginal distributions and a dependence measure: either product-moment or Spearman rank correlations. To quantify the impact from dependent input model and simulation estimation errors on system performance estimates, we propose a metamodel-assisted bootstrap framework that is applicable to cases when the parametric family of multivariate input distributions is known or unknown. In either case, we first characterize the input models by their moments that are estimated using real-world data. Then, we employ the bootstrap to quantify the input estimation error, and an equation-based stochastic kriging metamodel to propagate the input uncertainty to the output mean, which can also reduce the influence of simulation estimation error due to output variability. Asymptotic analysis provides theoretical support for our approach, while an empirical study demonstrates that it has good finite-sample performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25171","fieldValue":"NORTA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25172","fieldValue":" The minority game (MG) is an inductive binary-decision model that is able to study emergent behaviors in a population of agents who compete, through adaptation, for scarce resources. The original formulation of the game was inspired by the W.B. Arthurâ\u20AC™s El Farol Bar problem: a fixed number of people have to independently decide, each week, whether to go to a bar having a limited capacity. Peopleâ\u20AC™s choices are only affected by the information about the number of visitors who attended the bar in the past weeks. Basic MG assumes that the information about the past game outcomes is publicly available, and it does not contemplate any communication among players. This article proposes the Dynamic Sociality Minority Game (DSMG). DSMG is an original variant of the classic MG where (1) information about the outcome of the previously played game step is only known to agents that really attended the bar the previous week, and (2) a dynamically established acquaintance network is introduced to propagate such information to nonattendant players. Specific settings of the game are identified in which DSMG is able to show a better coordination level among players with respect to the standard MG. Emergent properties of the DSMG along with playersâ\u20AC™ wellness are thoroughly analyzed through agent-based simulation of a simple road-traffic model."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/25172","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: DIMES - Universit&#225; della Calabria, Rende (CS) - Italy (Cicirelli, Franco; Nigro, Libero)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25172","fieldValue":"ACM"}
