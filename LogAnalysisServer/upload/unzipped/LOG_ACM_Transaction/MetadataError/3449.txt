{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21298","fieldValue":" We present a computational geometry method for the problem of estimating the location of a source in the plane using measurements of distance-differences to it. Compared to existing solutions to this well-studied problem, this method is: (a) computationally more efficient and adaptive in that its precision can be controlled as a function of the number of computational operations, and (b) robust with respect to measurement and computational errors, and is not susceptible to numerical instabilities typical of existing linear algebraic or quadratic methods. This method employs a binary search on a distance-difference curve in the plane using a second distance-difference as the objective function. We show the correctness of this method by establishing the unimodality of directional derivative of the objective function within each of a small number of regions of the plane, wherein a suitable binary search is supported. The computational complexity of this method is O (log (1\/γ)), where the computed solution is guaranteed to be within a distance γ of the actual location of the source. We present simulation results to compare this method with existing DTOA localization methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21298","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21298","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21299","fieldValue":"Chiasserini, Carla-Fabiana"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21299","fieldValue":" A wireless sensor network with randomly deployed nodes can be used to provide an irregular sampling of a physical field of interest. We assume that a sink node collects the data gathered by the sensors and uses a linear filter for the reconstruction of a bandlimited scalar field defined over a d-dimensional domain. Sensors' locations are assumed to be known at the sink node, up to a certain position error. We then take the mean square error (MSE) of the reconstructed field as performance metric, and evaluate the effect of both uniform and quasi-equally spaced sensor layouts on the quality of the reconstructed field. We define a parameter that provides a measure of the regularity of the sensors deployment, and, through asymptotic analysis, we derive the MSE in the case of different sensor spatial distributions. For two of them, an approximate closed form expression is obtained. We validate our analysis through numerical results, and we show that an excellent match exists between analysis and simulation even for a small number of sensors."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/21299","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy (Nordio, Alessandro; Chiasserini, Carla-Fabiana); Universit&#224; della Calabria, Rende (CS) Italy (Viterbo, Emanuele)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21300","fieldValue":" Link asymmetry is one of the unique challenges that wireless sensor networks pose in the design of network protocols. We observe, based on testbed experiments, that a substantial percentage of links are asymmetric, many are even unidirectional. We also find that the reliability of synchronous acknowledgments is considerably higher than that of asynchronous messages. Thus the norm of estimating link quality bidirectionally via asynchronous beacons underestimates the link reliability of asymmetric links. This leads us to investigate how to exploit asymmetric links in order to improve network functions such as convergecast routing in sensor networks via one-way link estimation. We propose a new one-way link metric ETF (for the expected number of transmissions over forward links) and present a local procedure for its estimation. We use ETF to identify reliable forward links, and we use dynamic retransmission thresholding for error control. Via experiments on testbeds of CC1000 radios and CC2420 radios (an IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radio), we quantify the performance improvement in ETF as compared with ETX. We also study the performance improvement of ETF over ETX when no special mechanism is employed to discover asymmetric links or to control retransmissions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21300","fieldValue":"ACM"}
