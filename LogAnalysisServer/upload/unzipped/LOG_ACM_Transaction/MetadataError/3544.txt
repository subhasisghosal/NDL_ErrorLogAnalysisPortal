Lexicographic max-min (LM) rate allocation is a good solution but is nontrivial for multihop WSNs, as both fairness and sensing rates have to be optimized through the exploration of all possible forwarding routes in the network. All current optimal approaches to this problem are centralized and offline, suffering from low scalability and large computational complexityâ\u20AC\u201Dtypically solving $O(N^2$) linear programming problems for N-node WSNs. This article presents the first optimal distributed solution to this problem with much lower complexity. We apply it to solar-powered wireless sensor networks (SP-WSNs) to achieve both LM optimality and sustainable operation. Based on realistic models of both time-varying solar power and photovoltaic-battery hardware, we propose an optimization framework that integrates a local power management algorithm with a global distributed LM rate allocation scheme. The optimality, convergence, and efficiency of our approaches are formally proven. We also evaluate our algorithms via experiments on both solar-powered MICAz motes and extensive simulations using real solar energy data and practical power parameter settings. The results verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate how our approach outperforms both the state-of-the-art centralized optimal and distributed heuristic solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21527","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21527","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/3051","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"October 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3057\",\"title\":\"Issue 4(Special Issue on Chinese Spell Checking), October 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"June 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3056\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, June 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"March 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3055\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, March 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"January 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3054\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, January 2015\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21528","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor network applications, such as those for natural disaster warning, vehicular traffic monitoring, and surveillance, have stringent accuracy requirements for detecting or classifying events and demand long system lifetimes. Through quantitative study, we show that existing event detection approaches are challenged to explore the sensing capability of a deployed system and choose the right sensors to meet user-specified accuracy. Event detection systems are also challenged to provide a generic system that efficiently adapts to environmental dynamics and works easily with a range of applications, machine learning approaches, and sensor modalities. Consequently, we propose Watchdog, a modality-agnostic event detection framework that clusters the right sensors to meet user-specified detection accuracy during runtime while significantly reducing energy consumption. Watchdog can use different machine learning techniques to learn the sensing capability of a heterogeneous sensor deployment and meet accuracy requirements. To address environmental dynamics and ensure energy savings, Watchdog wakes up and puts to sleep sensors as needed to meet user-specified accuracy. Through evaluation with real vehicle detection trace data and a building traffic monitoring testbed of IRIS motes, we demonstrate the superior performance of Watchdog over existing solutions in terms of meeting user-specified detection accuracy, energy savings, and environmental adaptability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21529","fieldValue":" In wireless sensor networks, the spanning tree is usually used as a routing structure to collect data. In some situations, nodes do in-network aggregation to reduce transmissions, save energy, and maximize network lifetime. Because of the restricted energy of sensor nodes, how to build an aggregation tree of maximum lifetime is an important issue. It has been proved to be NP-complete in previous works. As shortest path spanning trees intuitively have short delay, it is imperative to find an energy-efficient shortest path tree for time-critical applications. In this article, we first study the problem of building maximum lifetime shortest path aggregation trees in wireless sensor networks. We show that when restricted to shortest path trees, building maximum lifetime aggregation trees can be solved in polynomial time. We present a centralized algorithm and design a distributed protocol for building such trees. Simulation results show that our approaches greatly improve the lifetime of the network and are very effective compared to other solutions. We extend our discussion to networks without aggregation and present interesting results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21529","fieldValue":"ACM"}
