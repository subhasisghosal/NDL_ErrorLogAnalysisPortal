However, for clothing images, fashion items have a large variety of layering and configuration, and it is hard to learn a certain statistical model of features that apply to general cases. In this article, we take fashion images as an example to show how Markov Random Fields (MRFs) can outperform Conditional Random Fields when the application does not follow a certain statistical model learned from the training data set. We propose a new method for automatically parsing fashion images in high processing efficiency with significantly less training time by applying a modification of MRFs, named reweighted MRF (RW-MRF), which resolves the problem of over smoothing infrequent labels. We further enhance RW-MRF with occlusion prior and background prior to resolve two other common problems in clothing parsing, occlusion, and background spill. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed clothing parsing method significantly improves processing time and training time over state-of-the-art methods, while ensuring comparable parsing accuracy and improving label recall rate."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25742","fieldValue":" Estimating missing entries in matrices has attracted much attention due to its wide range of applications like image inpainting and video denoising, which are usually considered as low-rank matrix completion problems theoretically. It is common to consider nuclear norm as a surrogate of the rank operator since it is the tightest convex lower bound of the rank operator under certain conditions. However, most approaches based on nuclear norm minimization involve a number of singular value decomposition (SVD) operations. Given a matrix X âˆˆ $R^mÃ\u2014n, the time complexity of the SVD operation is O(mn2$), which brings prohibitive computational burden on large-scale matrices, limiting the further usage of these methods in real applications. Motivated by this observation, a series of atom-decomposition-based matrix completion methods have been studied. The key to these methods is to reconstruct the target matrix by pursuit methods in a greedy way, which only involves the computation of the top SVD and has great advantages in efficiency compared with the SVD-based matrix completion methods. However, due to gradually serious accumulation errors, atom-decomposition-based methods usually result in unsatisfactory reconstruction accuracy. In this article, we propose a new efficient and scalable atom decomposition algorithm for matrix completion called Adaptive Basis Selection Strategy (ABSS). Different from traditional greedy atom decomposition methods, a two-phase strategy is conducted to generate the basis separately via different strategies according to their different nature. At first, we globally prune the basis space to eliminate the unimportant basis as much as possible and locate the probable subspace containing the most informative basis. Then, another group of basis spaces are learned to improve the recovery accuracy based on local information. In this way, our proposed algorithm breaks through the accuracy bottleneck of traditional atom-decomposition-based matrix completion methods; meanwhile, it reserves the innate efficiency advantages over SVD-based matrix completion methods. We empirically evaluate the proposed algorithm ABSS on real visual image data and large-scale recommendation datasets. Results have shown that ABSS has much better reconstruction accuracy with comparable cost to atom-decomposition-based methods. At the same time, it outperforms the state-of-the-art SVD-based matrix completion algorithms by similar or better reconstruction accuracy with enormous advantages on efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3484","fieldValue":" Visual exploration of clouds of data points is an important application of virtual environments. The common goal of this activity is to use the strengths of human perception to identify interesting structures in data, which are often not detected using traditional, computational analysis methods. In this article, we seek to identify some of the parameters that affect how well structures in visualized data clouds can be identified by a human observer. Two of the primary factors tested are the volumetric densities of the visualized structures and the presence\/absence of clutter around the displayed structures. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to glyph visualizationâ\u20AC\u201Dconstant visual angle (CVA) glyphsâ\u20AC\u201Dwhich has the potential to mitigate the effect of clutter at the cost of dispensing with the common real-world depth cue of relative size. In a controlled experiment where test subjects had to locate and select visualized structures in an immersive virtual environment, we identified several significant results. One result is that CVA glyphs ease perception of structures in cluttered environments while not deteriorating it when clutter is absent. Another is the existence of threshold densities, above which perception of structures becomes easier and more precise."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3484","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3484","fieldValue":"ACM"}
