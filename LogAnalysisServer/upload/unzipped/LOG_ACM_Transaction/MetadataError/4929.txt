The asymmetric distance takes advantage of less information loss at the query side. However, calculating asymmetric distances through exhaustive search is prohibitive in a large-scale dataset. We present a novel method, called multi-index voting, that integrates the multi-index hashing technique with a voting mechanism to select appropriate candidates and calculate their asymmetric distances. We show that the candidate selection scheme can be formulated as the tail of the binomial distribution function. In addition, a binary feature selection method based on minimal quantization error is proposed to address the memory insufficiency issue and improve the search accuracy. Substantial experimental evaluations were made to demonstrate that the proposed method can yield an approximate accuracy to the exhaustive search method while significantly accelerating the runtime. For example, one result shows that in a dataset of one billion 256-bit binary codes, examining only 0.5% of the dataset, can reach 95--99% close accuracy to the exhaustive search method and accelerate the search by 73--128 times. It also demonstrates an excellent tradeoff between the search accuracy and time efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art nearest-neighbor search methods. Moreover, the proposed feature selection method shows its effectiveness and improves the accuracy up to 8.35% compared with other feature selection methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25787","fieldValue":"Al-Tamimi, Abdel-Karim"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25787","fieldValue":" Recently, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)-based adaptive streaming has become the de facto standard for video streaming over the Internet. It allows clients to dynamically adapt media characteristics to the varying network conditions to ensure a high quality of experience (QoE)â\u20AC\u201Dthat is, minimize playback interruptions while maximizing video quality at a reasonable level of quality changes. In the case of live streaming, this task becomes particularly challenging due to the latency constraints. The challenge further increases if a client uses a wireless access network, where the throughput is subject to considerable fluctuations. Consequently, live streams often exhibit latencies of up to 20 to 30 seconds. In the present work, we introduce an adaptation algorithm for HTTP-based live streaming called LOLYPOP (short for low-latency prediction-based adaptation), which is designed to operate with a transport latency of a few seconds. To reach this goal, LOLYPOP leverages Transmission Control Protocol throughput predictions on multiple time scales, from 1 to 10 seconds, along with estimations of the relative prediction error distributions. In addition to satisfying the latency constraint, the algorithm heuristically maximizes the QoE by maximizing the average video quality as a function of the number of skipped segments and quality transitions. To select an efficient prediction method, we studied the performance of several time series prediction methods in IEEE 802.11 wireless access networks. We evaluated LOLYPOP under a large set of experimental conditions, limiting the transport latency to 3 seconds, against a state-of-the-art adaptation algorithm called FESTIVE. We observed that the average selected video representation index is by up to a factor of 3 higher than with the baseline approach. We also observed that LOLYPOP is able to reach points from a broader region in the QoE space, and thus it is better adjustable to the user profile or service provider requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/25787","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Technische Universit&#228;t Berlin, Germany (Miller, Konstantin; Wolisz, Adam); Yarmouk University, Irbid, Jordan (Al-Tamimi, Abdel-Karim)"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25787","fieldValue":"MPEG-DASH"}
