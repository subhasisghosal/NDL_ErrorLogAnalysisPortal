This paper examines two distance-based algorithms (GreedyBME and FastME) that are based on the principle of minimizing the balanced minimum evolution score of the output tree in relation to the given estimated distance matrix. This is also the principle that underlies the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm. We show that GreedyBME and FastME both reconstruct the entire correct tree if the input data are quartet consistent, and also that if the maximum error of any distance estimate is $(\\epsilon)$, then both algorithms output trees containing all sufficiently long edges of the true tree: those having length at least $(3\\epsilon)$. That is to say, the algorithms have edge safety radius 1\/3. In contrast, quartet consistency of the data is not sufficient to guarantee the NJ algorithm reconstructs the correct tree, and moreover, the NJ algorithm has edge safety radius of 1\/4: Only edges of the true tree of length at least $(4\\epsilon)$ can be guaranteed to appear in the output. These results give further theoretical support to the experimental evidence suggesting FastME is a more suitable distance-based phylogeny reconstruction method than the NJ algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4926","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4927","fieldValue":" To model biological systems using networks, it is desirable to allow more than two levels of expression for the nodes and to allow the introduction of parameters. Various modeling and simulation methods addressing these needs using Boolean models, both synchronous and asynchronous, have been proposed in the literature. However, analytical study of these more general Boolean networks models is lagging. This paper aims to develop a concise theory for these different Boolean logic-based modeling methods. Boolean models for networks where each node can have more than two levels of expression and Boolean models with parameters are defined algebraically with examples provided. Certain classes of random asynchronous Boolean networks and deterministic moduli asynchronous Boolean networks are investigated in detail using the setting introduced in this paper. The derived theorems provide a clear picture for the attractor structures of these asynchronous Boolean networks."}
