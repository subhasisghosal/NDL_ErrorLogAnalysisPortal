Both the G.711 and the G.729.1 codec yield periodic packet streams with a fixed packet size, the G.723.1 as well as the iLBC codec use silence detection leading to an on\/off process, and the GSM AMR and the iSAC codec produce periodic packet streams with variable packet sizes. We apply all codecs to a large set of typical speech samples and analyze the output of the codecs statistically. Based on these evaluations we provide quantitative models using standard and modified on\/off processes as well as memory Markov chains. Our models are simple and easy to use. They are in good accordance with the original traces as they capture not only the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the on\/off phase durations and the packet sizes, but also the autocorrelation function (ACF) of consecutive packet sizes as well as the queueing properties of the original traces. In contrast, voice traffic models used in most of today's simulations or analytical studies fail to reproduce the ACF and the queueing properties of original traces. This possibly leads to underestimation of performance measures like the waiting time or loss probabilities. The models proposed in this paper do not suffer from this shortcoming and present an attractive alternative for use in future performance studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9889","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9889","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9889","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9890","fieldValue":" The success of file swarming mechanisms such as BitTorrent has motivated a new approach for scalable streaming of live content that we call mesh-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) streaming. In this approach, participating end-systems (or peers) form a randomly connected mesh and incorporate swarming content delivery to stream live content. Despite the growing popularity of this approach, neither the fundamental design tradeoffs nor the basic performance bottlenecks in mesh-based P2P streaming are well understood. In this paper, we follow a performance-driven approach to design PRIME, a scalable mesh-based P2P streaming mechanism for live content. The main design goal of PRIME is to minimize two performance bottlenecks, namely bandwidth bottleneck and content bottleneck. We show that the global pattern of delivery for each segment of live content should consist of a diffusion phase which is followed by a swarming phase. This leads to effective utilization of available resources to accommodate scalability and also minimizes content bottleneck. Using packet level simulations, we carefully examine the impact of overlay connectivity, packet scheduling scheme at individual peers and source behavior on the overall performance of the system. Our results reveal fundamental design tradeoffs of mesh-based P2P streaming for live content."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9890","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9890","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9890","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1897","fieldValue":"LEE, Hyung Gyu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1897","fieldValue":" The rapid emergence of Chip Multi-Processors (CMP) as the de facto microprocessor archetype has highlighted the importance of scalable and efficient on-chip networks. Packet-based Networks-on-Chip (NoC) are gradually cementing themselves as the medium of choice for the multi-\/many-core systems of the near future, due to their innate scalability. However, the prominence of the debilitating power wall requires the NoC to also be as energy efficient as possible. To achieve these two antipodal requirementsâ\u20AC\u201Dscalability and energy efficiencyâ\u20AC\u201Dwe propose TornadoNoC, an interconnect architecture that employs a novel flow control mechanism. To prevent livelocks and deadlocks, a sequence numbering scheme and a dynamic ring inflation technique are proposed, and their correctness formally proven. The primary objective of TornadoNoC is to achieve substantial gains in (a) scalability to many-core systems and (b) the area\/power footprint, as compared to current state-of-the-art router implementations. The new router is demonstrated to provide better scalability to hundreds of cores than an ideal single-cycle wormhole implementation and other scalability-enhanced low-cost routers. Extensive simulations using both synthetic traffic patterns and real applications running in a full-system simulator corroborate the efficacy of the proposed design. Finally, hardware synthesis analysis using commercial 65nm standard-cell libraries indicates that the area and power budgets of the new router are reduced by up to 53&percnt; and 58&percnt;, respectively, as compared to existing state-of-the-art low-cost routers."}
