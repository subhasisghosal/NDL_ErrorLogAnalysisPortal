The combinatorial theory of RNA structures and the dynamic programming algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction are extended here to incorporate G-quadruplexes using a simple but plausible energy model. With preliminary energy parameters, we find that the overwhelming majority of putative quadruplex-forming sequences in the human genome are likely to fold into canonical secondary structures instead. Stable G-quadruplexes are strongly enriched, however, in the 5Ê¹UTR of protein coding mRNAs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4975","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4975","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4975","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1425","fieldValue":" Technology aimed at enhancing function and enabling independent living among older and disabled adults is a growing field of research. Privacy concerns are a potential barrier to adoption of such technology. Using data from a national Web survey (n=1,518), we focus on perceived acceptability of sharing information about toileting, taking medications, moving about the home, cognitive ability, driving behavior, and vital signs with five targets: family, healthcare providers, insurance companies, researchers, and government. We also examine acceptability of recording the behaviors using three methods: video with sound, video without sound, and sensors. Results show that sharing or recording information about toileting behavior; sharing information with the government and insurance companies; and recording the information using video were least acceptable. Respondents who reported current disability were significantly more accepting of sharing and recording of information than nondisabled adults, controlling for demographic variables, general technology attitudes, and assistive device use. Results for age were less consistent, although older respondents tended to be more accepting than younger respondents. The study provides empirical evidence from a large national sample of the implicit trade-offs between privacy and the potential for improved health among older and disabled adults in quality of life technology applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1425","fieldValue":"Disability, Age, and Informational Privacy Attitudes in Quality of Life Technology Applications: Results from a National Web Survey"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1425","fieldValue":"ACM"}
