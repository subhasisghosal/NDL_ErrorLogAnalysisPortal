The method has been first formalized by von Neumann [1951] and has many applications in classical computing. We define a quantum analogue of rejection sampling: given a black box producing a coherent superposition of (possibly unknown) quantum states with some amplitudes, the problem is to prepare a coherent superposition of the same states, albeit with different target amplitudes. The main result of this article is a tight characterization of the query complexity of this quantum state generation problem. We exhibit an algorithm, which we call quantum rejection sampling, and analyze its cost using semidefinite programming. Our proof of a matching lower bound is based on the automorphism principle that allows to symmetrize any algorithm over the automorphism group of the problem. Our main technical innovation is an extension of the automorphism principle to continuous groups that arise for quantum state generation problems where the oracle encodes unknown quantum states, instead of just classical data. Furthermore, we illustrate how quantum rejection sampling may be used as a primitive in designing quantum algorithms, by providing three different applications. We first show that it was implicitly used in the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations by Harrow et al. [2009]. Second we show that it can be used to speed up the main step in the quantum Metropolis sampling algorithm by Temme et al. [2011]. Finally, we derive a new quantum algorithm for the hidden shift problem of an arbitrary Boolean function and relate its query complexity to â\u20ACœwater-fillingâ\u20AC? of the Fourier spectrum."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12501","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12501","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12502","fieldValue":" We study the setting in which the bits of an unknown infinite binary sequence x are revealed sequentially to an observer. We show that very limited assumptions about x allow one to make successful predictions about unseen bits of x. First, we study the problem of successfully predicting a single 0 from among the bits of x. In our model, we have only one chance to make a prediction, but may do so at a time of our choosing. This model is applicable to a variety of situations in which we want to perform an action of fixed duration, and need to predict a â\u20ACœsafeâ\u20AC? time-interval to perform it. Letting $N_t denote the number of 1s among the first t bits of x, we say that x is â\u20ACœ&epsis;-weakly sparseâ\u20AC? if lim inf (Nt\/t) â\u2030¤ &epsiv;. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that, given any &epsiv;-weakly sparse sequence x, predicts a 0 of x with success probability as close as desired to 1 - &epsiv;. Thus, we can perform this task with essentially the same success probability as under the much stronger assumption that each bit of x takes the value 1 independently with probability &epsiv;. We apply this result to show how to successfully predict a bit (0 or 1) under a broad class of possible assumptions on the sequence x. The assumptions are stated in terms of the behavior of a finite automaton M reading the bits of x. We also propose and solve a variant of the well-studied â\u20ACœignorant forecastingâ\u20AC? problem. For every &epsiv;>0, we give a randomized forecasting algorithm S&epsiv;$ that, given sequential access to a binary sequence x, makes a prediction of the form: â\u20ACœA p fraction of the next N bits will be 1s.â\u20AC? (The algorithm gets to choose p, N, and the time of the prediction.) For any fixed sequence x, the forecast fraction p is accurate to within Â±&epsiv; with probability 1 - &epsiv;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12502","fieldValue":"ACM"}
