This article presents the modeling and the validation of its medium access, using model checking on Time Petri Nets. Doing so, we show that existent formal methods and tools are not perfectly suitable for the validation of real systems, especially when some hardware parameters have to be considered. This article then presents how these difficulties have been managed during the modeling and verification phases, and gives the validation results for STIMAP, providing constraints to respect."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6602","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6602","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6603","fieldValue":" The main problem of verification techniques based on exploration of (reachable) state space is the state explosion problem. In timed models, abstract states reached by different interleavings of the same set of transitions are, in general, different and their union is not necessarily an abstract state. To attenuate this state explosion, it would be interesting to reduce the redundancy caused by the interleaving semantics by agglomerating all these abstract states whenever their union is an abstract state. This article considers the time Petri net model and establishes some sufficient conditions that ensure that this union is an abstract state. In addition, it proposes a procedure to compute this union without computing beforehand intermediate abstract states. Finally, it shows how to use this result to improve the reachability analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6603","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6603","fieldValue":"ACM"}
