The increased processor utilization leads to a low-cost system implementation with no sacrifice in performance requirements and to reduced custom hardware in a typical SOC. We illustrate these ideas through the branch resolution problem, known to impose severe performance degradation on control-dominated embedded applications. A customization approach for early branch resolution and subsequent folding is presented. The application-specific information is captured by the microarchitecture through a low-cost reprogrammable hardware, thus attaining the twin benefits of processor standardization and application-specific customization. Experimental results show that for a representative set of control-dominated applications a reduction in the range of 3--22&percnt; in processor cycles can be achieved, thus extending the scope of low-cost embedded processors in complex codesigns for control intensive systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/1051","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"December 2006\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1063\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, December 2006\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"September 2006\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1062\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, September 2006\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6257","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6257","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6257","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6258","fieldValue":"Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Alberto L."}
