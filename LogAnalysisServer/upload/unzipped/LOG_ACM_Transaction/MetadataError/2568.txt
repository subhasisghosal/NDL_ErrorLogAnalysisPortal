The program decomposes the function into subexpressions which are recursively tested for intervals where they are undefined, negative, or fractional, or points where they equal zero. The intervals in which the subexpressions are undefined are then united to create the boundaries of the domain of definition of the whole function. The advantages of the use of such a program in solution of systems of nonlinear algebraic equations and nonlinear optimization are demonstrated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18654","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18654","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18655","fieldValue":"ACM"}
