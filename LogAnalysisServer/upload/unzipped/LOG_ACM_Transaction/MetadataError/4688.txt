Similar to batching, sectioning partitions the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) outputs into nonoverlapping batches and computes a quantile estimator from each batch. But rather than centering the CI at the average of the quantile estimators across the batches, as in batching, sectioning centers the CI at the overall quantile estimator based on all the outputs. A similar modification is made to the sample variance, which is used to determine the width of the CI. We establish the asymptotic validity of the sectioning CI for importance sampling and control variates, and the proofs rely on first showing that the corresponding quantile estimators satisfy a Bahadur representation, which we have done in prior work. Here, we present some numerical results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25106","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25106","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25107","fieldValue":"Nielsen, Martin K"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25107","fieldValue":" Emerging drug resistance in parasitology and its impact on human and animal health are of serious concern. Attempts by the parasitology community to address this issue led to the introduction of so-called selective therapy where a proportion of the population is left untreated. This has led to re-emergence of parasites that have heretofore been controlled. Using stochastic simulations, this article explores the tradeoff between drug resistance and re-emergence. More importantly, the article identifies the importance of the parasite fitness parameter vector and its role in drug resistance. Suggestions for further biological work and statistical analyses are also provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25107","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25107","fieldValue":"ACM"}
