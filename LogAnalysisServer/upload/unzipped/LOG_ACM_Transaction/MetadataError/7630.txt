Such paths, however, may not exist in a network. In such a situation, paths with minimum link and\/or node sharing may be considered. This paper addresses the following two related fundamental questions. First, in case of no solution of disjoint multiple paths for a given application instance, what are the criteria for finding the best solution in which paths share nodes and\/or links? Second, if we know the criteria, how do we find the best solution? We propose a general framework for the answers to these two questions. This framework can be configured in a way that is suitable for a given application instance. We introduce the notion of link shareability and node shareability and consider the problem of finding minimum-cost multiple paths subject to minimum shareabilities (MCMPMS problem). We identify 65 different link\/node shareability constraints, each leading to a specific version of the MCMPMS problem. In a previously published technical report, we prove that all the 65 versions are mutually inequivalent. In this paper, we show that all these versions can be solved using a unified algorithmic approach that consists of two algorithm schemes, each of which can be used to generate polynomial-time algorithms for a set of versions of MCMPMS. We also discuss some extensions where our modeling framework and algorithm schemes are applicable."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10069","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10069","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10069","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10070","fieldValue":" Forwarding decisions in routing protocols rely on information about the destination nodes provided by routing table states. When paths to a destination change, corresponding states become invalid and need to be refreshed with control messages for resilient routing. In large and highly dynamic networks, this overhead can crowd out the capacity for data traffic. For such networks, we propose the concept of weak state, which is interpreted as a probabilistic hint, not as absolute truth. Weak state can remain valid without explicit messages by systematically reducing the confidence in its accuracy. Weak State Routing (WSR) is a novel routing protocol that uses weak state along with random directional walks for forwarding packets. When a packet reaches a node that contains a weak state about the destination with higher confidence than that held by the packet, the walk direction is biased. The packet reaches the destination via a sequence of directional walks, punctuated by biasing decisions. WSR also uses random directional walks for disseminating routing state and provides mechanisms for aggregating weak state. Our simulation results show that WSR offers a very high packet delivery ratio (â\u2030¥ 98%). Control traffic overhead scales as O(N), and the state complexity is $Î˜(N^3\/2$), where N is the number of nodes. Packets follow longer paths compared to prior protocols (OLSR [2], GLS-GPSR [3], [4]), but the average path length is asymptotically efficient and scales as O(âˆšN). Despite longer paths, WSR's end-to-end packet delivery delay is much smaller due to the dramatic reduction in protocol overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10070","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10070","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10070","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10071","fieldValue":"Thejaswi, P.
