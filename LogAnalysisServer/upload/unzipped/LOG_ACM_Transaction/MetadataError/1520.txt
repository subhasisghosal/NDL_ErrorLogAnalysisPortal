The simulation is based on the theory of light scattering by small particles. A realistic atmosphere model is assumed, consisting of air molecules, aerosols, and water. Air density, aerosols, and relative humidity vary with altitude. In addition, the aerosol component varies in composition and particle-size distribution. This allows us to realistically simulate twilight phenomena for a wide range of different climate conditions. Besides considering multiple Rayleigh and Mie scattering, we take into account wavelength-dependent refraction of direct sunlight as well as the shadow of the Earth. Incorporating several optimizations into the radiative transfer simulation, a photo-realistic hemispherical twilight sky is computed in less than two hours on a conventional PC. The resulting radiometric data is useful, for instance, for high-dynamic range environment mapping, outdoor global illumination calculations, mesopic vision research and optical aerosol load probing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15624","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15624","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15625","fieldValue":"Bonneau, Georges-Pierre"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15625","fieldValue":" Smooth parametric surfaces interpolating triangular meshes are very useful for modeling surfaces of arbitrary topology. Several interpolants based on these kind of surfaces have been developed over the last fifteen years. However, with current 3D acquisition equipments, models are becoming more and more complex. Since previous interpolation methods lack a local refinement property, there is no way to locally adapt the level of detail. In this article, we introduce a hierarchical triangular surface model. The surface is overall tangent plane continuous and is defined parametrically as a piecewise quintic polynomial. It can be adaptively refined while preserving the overall tangent plane continuity. This model enables designers to create a complex smooth surface of arbitrary topology composed of a small number of patches to which details can be added by locally refining the patches until an arbitrary small size is reached. It is implemented as a hierarchical data structure where the top layer describes a coarse, smooth base surface and the lower levels encode the details in local frame coordinates."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/15625","fieldValue":"B&eacute;zier patches"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/15625","fieldValue":"G<sup>1<\/sup>-continuity"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15625","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15625","fieldValue":"ACM"}
