{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6490","fieldValue":" Prior research on schedulability bounds focused primarily on bounding utilization\/ as a means to meet deadline constraints. Nontrivial bounds were found for a handful of scheduling policies in which utilization is directly related to the ability of the policy to meet deadlines. Examples include rate-monotonic, deadline-monotonic, and EDF scheduling. For most other scheduling policies, however, utilization is not correlated with schedulability. For example, shortest-job-first can miss deadlines at an arbitrarily low utilization. This raises the question of whether or not some other nonutilization-based metric might be more indicative of schedulability in those cases. This article answers the above question positively by extending the notion of schedulability bounds, in a uniform manner, to arbitrary (fixed) priorities and nonutilization metrics. We present a simple function that generates the schedulability metric to be bounded from the definition of a fixed-priority scheduling policy, and derive a nontrivial schedulability bound on that metric for aperiodic tasks. It is shown that the generated metrics and bounds are valid in that no deadline misses occur when these bounds are not violated. This result allows efficient real-time admission control to be performed in systems with arbitrary fixed-priority scheduling policies. As an example, we illustrate applying schedulability bounds for admission control to shortest-job-first and velocity-monotonic scheduling. While the proposed nonutilization bounds and feasible regions are derived for fixed-priority scheduling policies, the authors are investigating extensions of the results to dynamic-priority scheduling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6491","fieldValue":" Application profilingâ\u20AC\u201Dthe process of monitoring an application to determine the frequency of execution within specific regionsâ\u20AC\u201Dis an essential step within the design process for many software and hardware systems. Profiling is often a critical step within hardware\/software partitioning utilized to determine the critical kernels of an application. In this article, we present an innovative, nonintrusive dynamic application profiler (DAProf) capable of profiling an executing application by monitoring the application's short backward branches, function calls, and function returns. The resulting profile information provides an accurate characterization of the frequently executed loops within the application providing a breakdown of loop executions versus loop iterations per execution. DAProf achieves excellent profiling accuracy with an average accuracy of 98&percnt; for loop executions, 97&percnt; for average iterations per execution, and 95&percnt; for percentage of execution time. In addition, the presented dynamic application profiler incurs as little as 11&percnt; area overhead compared to an ARM9 microprocessor. DAProf is ideally suited for rapidly profiling software applications and dynamic optimization approaches such as dynamic hardware\/software partitioning in which detailed loop execution information is needed to provide accurate performance estimates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1596","fieldValue":"Hsu, Wei-Chung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1596","fieldValue":"Yew, Pen-Chung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1596","fieldValue":"Ju, Roy Dz-Ching"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1596","fieldValue":"Ngai, Tin-Fook"}
