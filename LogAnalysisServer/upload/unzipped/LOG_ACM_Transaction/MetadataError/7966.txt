We first analyze conditions under which the Bloom paradox occurs in a Bloom Filter and demonstrate that it depends on the a priori probability that a given element belongs to the represented set. We show that the Bloom paradox also applies to Counting Bloom Filters (CBFs) and depends on the product of the hashed counters of each element. In addition, we further suggest improved architectures that deal with the Bloom paradox in Bloom Filters, CBFs, and their variants. We further present an application of the presented theory in cache sharing among Web proxies. Lastly, using simulations, we verify our theoretical results and show that our improved schemes can lead to a large improvement in the performance of Bloom Filters and CBFs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10749","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10749","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10749","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10750","fieldValue":" Clock synchronization is an enabling service for a wide range of applications and protocols in both wired and wireless networks. We study the implications of clock drift and communication latency on the accuracy of clock synchronization when scaling the network diameter. Starting with a theoretical analysis of synchronization protocols, we prove tight bounds on the synchronization error in a model that assumes independently and randomly distributed communication delays and slowly changing drifts. While this model is more optimistic than traditional worst-case analysis, it much better captures the nature of real-world systems such as wireless networks. The bound on the synchronization accuracy, which is roughly the square root of the network diameter, is achieved by the novel PulseSync protocol. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PulseSync is able to meet the predictions from theory and tightly synchronizes large networks. This contrasts against an exponential growth of the skew incurred by the state-of-the-art protocol for wireless sensor networks. Moreover, PulseSync adapts much faster to network dynamics and changing clock drifts than this protocol."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10750","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10750","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10750","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10751","fieldValue":"Hou, I-Hong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10751","fieldValue":" There is increasing demand for using wireless networks for applications that generate packets with strict per-packet delay constraints. In addition to delay constraints, such applications also have various traffic patterns and require guarantees on throughputs of packets that are delivered within their delay constraints. Furthermore, a mechanism for serving delay-constrained traffic needs to specifically consider the unreliable nature of wireless links, which may differ from link to link. Also, as it is usually infeasible to gather feedback information from all clients after each transmission, broadcasting delay-constrained traffic requires addressing the challenge of the lack of feedback information. We study a model that jointly considers the application requirements on traffic patterns, delay constraints, and throughput requirements, as well as wireless limitations, including the unreliable wireless links and the lack of feedback information. Based on this model, we develop a general framework for designing feasibility-optimal broadcasting policies that applies to systems with various network coding mechanisms. We demonstrate the usage of this framework by designing policies for three different kinds of systems: one that does not use network coding, one that employs XOR coding, and the last that allows the usage of linear coding."}
