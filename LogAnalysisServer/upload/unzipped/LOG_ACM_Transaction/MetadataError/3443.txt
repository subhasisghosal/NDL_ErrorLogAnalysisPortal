{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21283","fieldValue":" We study the problem of localizing a large sensor network having a complex shape, possibly with holes. A major challenge with respect to such networks is to figure out the correct network layout, that is, avoid global flips where a part of the network folds on top of another. Our algorithm first selects landmarks on network boundaries with sufficient density, then constructs the landmark Voronoi diagram and its dual combinatorial Delaunay complex on these landmarks. The key insight is that the combinatorial Delaunay complex is provably globally rigid and has a unique realization in the plane. Thus an embedding of the landmarks by simply gluing the Delaunay triangles properly recovers the faithful network layout. With the landmarks nicely localized, the rest of the nodes can easily localize themselves by trilateration to nearby landmark nodes. This leads to a practical and accurate localization algorithm for large networks using only network connectivity. Simulations on various network topologies show surprisingly good results. In comparison, previous connectivity-based localization algorithms such as multidimensional scaling and rubberband representation generate globally flipped or distorted localization results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21283","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21283","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21284","fieldValue":" Base station location has a significant impact on network lifetime performance for a sensor network. For a multihop sensor network, this problem is particularly challenging due to its coupling with data routing. This article presents an approximation algorithm that can guarantee (1 âˆ\u2019 &epsiv;)-optimal network lifetime performance for base station placement problem with any desired error bound &epsiv; > 0. The proposed (1 âˆ\u2019 &epsiv;)-optimal approximation algorithm is based on several novel techniques that makes it possible to reduce an infinite search space to a finite-element search space for base station location. The first technique used in this reduction is to discretize cost parameter (associated with energy consumption) with performance guarantee. Subsequently, the continuous search space can be broken up into a finite number of subareas. The second technique is to exploit the cost property of each subarea and represent it by a novel notion called fictitious cost point, each with guaranteed cost bounds. We give a proof that the proposed base station placement algorithm is (1âˆ\u2019 &epsiv;)-optimal. This approximation algorithm is simpler and faster than a state-of-the-art algorithm and represents the best known result to the base station placement problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21285","fieldValue":" Local storage is required in many sensor network applications, both for archival of detailed event information, as well as to overcome sensor platform memory constraints. Recent gains in energy efficiency of new-generation NAND flash storage have strengthened the case for in-network storage by data-centric sensor network applications. We argue that current storage solutions offering a simple file system abstraction are inadequate for sensor applications to exploit storage. Instead, we propose Capsuleâ\u20AC\u201Da rich, flexible and portable object storage abstraction that offers stream, file, array, queue and index storage objects for data storage and retrieval. Further, Capsule supports checkpointing and rollback of object state for fault tolerance.

The coverage area is partitioned into regions and we seek to identify the region of a sensor based on observations by stationary clusterheads. Observations (e.g., signal strength) are assumed random. We pose the localization problem as a composite multihypothesis testing problem, develop the requisite theory, and address the problem of optimally placing clusterheads. We show that localization decisions can be distributed by appropriate in-network processing. The approach is validated in a testbed yielding promising results."}
