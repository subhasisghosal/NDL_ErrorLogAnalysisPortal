We study probe wear, and analyze the causes of uneven wear. We show that under real-world workloads some probes can wear one order of magnitude faster than others. This premature expiry has severe consequences for reliability, timing performance, energy efficiency, and lifetime. Wear leveling precludes premature expiry and is thus necessary. We discuss the fundamental differences between probe wear in MEMS storage and medium wear in Flash, calling for a different treatment. We devise three policies to level probe wear. The policies provide a spectrum between best lifetime and least influence on the response time and energy efficiency of a MEMS storage device. We make the case that data migration can be prevented by augmenting the policies with a simple rule. We study the influence of the data layout configuration on the leveling performance of the policies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13293","fieldValue":"Lam, Tak-Kei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13293","fieldValue":"Tang, Wai-Chung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13293","fieldValue":"Wu, Yu-Liang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13293","fieldValue":" Rewiring is known to be a class of logic restructuring technique that is at least equally powerful in flexibility compared to other logic transformation techniques. Especially it is wiring sensitive and is particularly useful for interconnect-based circuit synthesis processes. One of the most well-studied rewiring techniques is the ATPG-based Redundancy Addition and Removal (RAR) technique which adds a redundant alternative wire to make an originally irredundant target wire become redundant and thus removable. In this article, we propose a new Error-Cancellation-based Rewiring scheme (ECR) which can also identify non-RAR-based rewiring operations with high efficiency. In ECR scheme, it is not necessary for alternative wires to be redundant. Based on the notion of error cancellation, we analyze and reformulate the rewiring problem, and a more generalized rewiring scheme is developed to detect more rewiring cases which are not obtainable by existing schemes while it still maintains a low runtime complexity. Comparing with the most recent non-RAR rewiring tool IRRA, the total number of alternative wires found by our approach is about doubled (202&percnt;) while the CPU time used is just slightly more (8&percnt;) upon benchmarks preoptimized by ABCâ\u20AC™s rewriting. Our experimental results also suggest that the ECR engine is more powerful than IRRA in FPGA technology mapping."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13293","fieldValue":"ATPG"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13293","fieldValue":"ACM"}
