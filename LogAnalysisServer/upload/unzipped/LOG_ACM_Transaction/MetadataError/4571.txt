{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24818","fieldValue":" The gradual acceptance of high-performance networks as a fundamental component of today's computing environment has allowed applications to evolve from static entities located on specific hosts to dynamic, distributed entities that are resident on one or more hosts. In addition, vital components of software and data used by an application may be distributed across the local\/wide area network. Given such a fluid and dynamic environment, the design and analysis of high-performance communication networks (using off-the-shelf components offered by third party manufacturers) has been further complicated by the diversity of the available components. To alleviate these problems and to address the verification and validation issues involved in engineering such complex networks, a web-based framework for the design and analysis of computer networks was developed. Using the framework, a designer can explore design alternatives by constructing and analyzing configurations of the design using components offered by different researchers and manufacturers. The framework provides a flexible and robust environment for selecting and verifying the optimal solution from a large and complex solution space. This paper presents issues involved in the design and development of the framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24819","fieldValue":"Fortes, Jos A B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24819","fieldValue":" This paper describes the Web interface management infrastructure of a functioning network-computing system (PUNCH) that allows users to run unmodified simulation packages at geographically dispersed sites. The system currently contains more than fifty university and commercial simulation tools, and has been used to carry out more than two hundred thousand simulations via the World Wide Web. Dynamically-constructed virtual URLs allow the Web interface management infrastructure to support the semantics associated with an interface to computing services without requiring any changes to Web browsers or WWW protocols. Virtual URLs also facilitate customizable control of access to networked resources. Simulation tools with text-based interfaces are supported via dynamically-generated, virtual interfaces, whereas tools with graphical interfaces are supported by leveraging available remote display-management technologies. Virtual interface generation and interactivity emulation are handled by a programmable state machine in conjunction with a mechanism to embed variables and ovjects within standard HTML."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24819","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24819","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24820","fieldValue":" Designing and developing new aircraft systems is time-consuming and expensive. Computational simulation is a promising means for reducing design cycle times, but requires a flexible software environment capable of integrating advanced multidisciplinary and multifidelity analysis methods, dynamically managing data across heterogeneous computing platforms, and distributing computationally complex tasks. Web-based simulation, with its emphasis on collaborative composition of simulation models, distributed heterogeneous execution, and dynamic multimedia documentation, has the potential to meet these requirements. This paper outlines the current aircraft design process, highlighting its problems and complexities, and presents our vision of an aircraft design process using Web-based modeling and simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24820","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24820","fieldValue":"ACM"}
