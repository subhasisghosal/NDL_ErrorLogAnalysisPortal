We study the problem of approximating the total influence of a monotone Boolean function, which we denote by I[f]. We present a randomized algorithm that approximates the influence of such functions to within a multiplicative factor of (1 ± ε) by performing O(√n I[f] poly(1\/ε)) queries. We also prove a lower bound of Ω(√n logn·I[f]) on the query complexity of any constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem (which holds for I[f]=Ω(1)), hence showing that our algorithm is almost optimal in terms of its dependence on n. For general functions, we give a lower bound of Ω(n I[f]), which matches the complexity of a simple sampling algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12490","fieldValue":"Littman, Michael L"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12490","fieldValue":" We show that the problem of finding an optimal stochastic blind controller in a Markov decision process is an NP-hard problem. The corresponding decision problem is NP-hard in PSPACE and sqrt-sum-hard, hence placing it in NP would imply breakthroughs in long-standing open problems in computer science. Our result establishes that the more general problem of stochastic controller optimization in POMDPs is also NP-hard. Nonetheless, we outline a special case that is convex and admits efficient global solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12491","fieldValue":" Motivated by the pervasiveness of strong inapproximability results for Max-CSPs, we introduce a relaxed notion of an approximate solution of a Max-CSP. In this relaxed version, loosely speaking, the algorithm is allowed to replace the constraints of an instance by some other (possibly real-valued) constraints, and then only needs to satisfy as many of the new constraints as possible. To be more precise, we introduce the following notion of a predicate P being useful for a (real-valued) objective Q: given an almost satisfiable Max-P instance, there is an algorithm that beats a random assignment on the corresponding Max-Q instance applied to the same sets of literals. The standard notion of a nontrivial approximation algorithm for a Max-CSP with predicate P is exactly the same as saying that P is useful for P itself. We say that P is useless if it is not useful for any Q. This turns out to be equivalent to the following pseudo-randomness property: given an almost satisfiable instance of Max-P, it is hard to find an assignment such that the induced distribution on k-bit strings defined by the instance is not essentially uniform. Under the unique games conjecture, we give a complete and simple characterization of useful Max-CSPs defined by a predicate: such a Max-CSP is useless if and only if there is a pairwise independent distribution supported on the satisfying assignments of the predicate. It is natural to also consider the case when no negations are allowed in the CSP instance, and we derive a similar complete characterization (under the UGC) there as well. Finally, we also include some results and examples shedding additional light on the approximability of certain Max-CSPs."}
