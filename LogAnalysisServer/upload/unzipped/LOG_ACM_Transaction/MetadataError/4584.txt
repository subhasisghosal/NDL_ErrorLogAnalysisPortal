Experiments with human signers show that sign language signs contain redundancy over time. In this article, experiments are conducted to investigate whether comparable redundancies also exist for an automatic sign language recognition system. Such redundancies could be exploited, for example, by reserving more processing resources for the more informative phases of a sign, or by discarding uninformative phases. In the experiments, an automatic system is trained and tested on isolated fragments of sign language signs. The stimuli used were similar to those of the human signer experiments, allowing us to compare the results. The experiments show that redundancy over time exists for the automatic recognizer. The central phase of a sign is the most informative phase, and the first half of a sign is sufficient to achieve a recognition performance similar to that of the entire sign. These findings concur with the results of the human signer studies. However, there are differences as well, most notably the fact that human signers score better on the early phases of a sign than the automatic system. The results can be used to improve the automatic recognizer, by using only the most informative phases of a sign as input."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3403","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3403","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24850","fieldValue":" We show how to solve the maximal cut and partition problems using a randomized algorithm based on the cross-entropy method. For the maximal cut problem, the proposed algorithm employs an auxiliary Bernoulli distribution, which transforms the original deterministic network into an associated stochastic one, called the associated stochastic network (ASN). Each iteration of the randomized algorithm for the ASN involves the following two phases:(1) Generation of random cuts using a multidimensional Ber(p) distribution and calculation of the associated cut lengths (objective functions) and some related quantities, such as rare-event probabilities.(2) Updating the parameter vector p on the basis of the data collected in the first phase.We show that the Ber(p) distribution converges in distribution to a degenerated one, $Ber(pd^&ast;), pd&ast; = (pd,1,...,pd,n) in the sense that someelements of pd&ast;, will be unities and the rest zeros. The unity elements of pd&ast;$ uniquely define a cut which will be taken as the estimate of the maximal cut. A similar approach is used for the partition problem. Supporting numerical results are given as well. Our numerical studies suggest that for the maximal cut and partition problems the proposed algorithm typically has polynomial complexity in the size of the network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24850","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24850","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24851","fieldValue":"Vzquez-abad, Felisa J."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24851","fieldValue":"Andrew, Lachlan L H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24851","fieldValue":" Blocking probabilities in cellular mobile communication networks using dynamic channel assignment are hard to compute for realistic sized systems. This computational difficulty is due to the structure of the state space, which imposes strong coupling constraints amongst components of the occupancy vector. Approximate tractable models have been proposed, which have product form stationary state distributions. However, for real channel assignment schemes, the product form is a poor approximation and it is necessary to simulate the actual occupancy process in order to estimate the blocking probabilities.Meaningful estimates of the blocking probability typically require an enormous amount of CPU time for simulation, since blocking events are usually rare. Advanced simulation approaches use importance sampling (IS) to overcome this problem. In this article, we study two regimes under which blocking is a rare event: low-load and high cell capacity. Our simulations use the standard clock (SC) method. For low load, we propose a change of measure that we call static ISSC, which has bounded relative error. For high capacity, we use a change of measure that depends on the current state of the network occupancy. This is the dynamic ISSC method. We prove that this method yields zero variance estimators for single clique models, and we empirically show the advantages of this method over na√Øve simulation for networks of moderate size and traffic loads."}
