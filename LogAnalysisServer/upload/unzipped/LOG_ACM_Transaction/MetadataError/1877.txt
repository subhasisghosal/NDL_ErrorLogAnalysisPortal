Typically this is enabled based on tedious recording of artists' drawing process. We demonstrate that it is often possible to estimate a reasonable drawing order from a static line drawing with clearly defined shape geometry, which looks plausible to a human viewer. We map the key principles of drawing order from drawing cognition to computational procedures in our framework. Our system produces plausible animated constructions of input line drawings, with no or little user intervention. We test our algorithm on a range of input sketches, with varying degree of complexity and structure, and evaluate the results via a user study. We also present applications to gesture drawing synthesis and drawing animation creation especially in the context of video scribing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16531","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16531","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16532","fieldValue":" This paper presents a lightweight sketching system that enables interactive illustration of complex fluid systems. Users can sketch on a 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) canvas to design the shapes and connections of a fluid circuit. These input sketches are automatically analyzed and abstracted into a hydraulic graph, and a new hybrid fluid model is used in the background to enhance the illustrations. The system provides rich simple operations for users to edit the fluid system incrementally, and the new internal flow patterns can be simulated in real time. Our system is used to illustrate various fluid systems in medicine, biology, and engineering. We asked professional medical doctors to try our system and obtained positive feedback from them."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16533","fieldValue":" We present a novel, real-time algorithm for modeling large-scale, realistic traffic using a hybrid model of both continuum and agent-based methods for traffic simulation. We simulate individual vehicles in regions of interest using state-of-the-art agent-based models of driver behavior, and use a faster continuum model of traffic flow in the remainder of the road network. Our key contributions are efficient techniques for the dynamic coupling of discrete vehicle simulation with the aggregated behavior of continuum techniques for traffic simulation. We demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our interactive visual simulation technique on extensive road networks using both real-world traffic data and synthetic scenarios. These techniques demonstrate the applicability of hybrid techniques to the efficient simulation of large-scale flows with complex dynamics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16533","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16533","fieldValue":"ACM"}
