The methodology is applied to a stochastic reaction network of competence dynamics in Bacillus subtilis bacterium. In particular, the dependence of the competence state on rate constants of underlying reactions is investigated. We base our methodology on Polynomial Chaos (PC) spectral expansions that allow effective propagation of input parameter uncertainties to outputs of interest. Given a number of forward model training runs at sampled input parameter values, the PC modes are estimated using a Bayesian framework. As an outcome, these PC modes are described with posterior probability distributions. The resulting expansion can be regarded as an uncertain response function and can further be used as a computationally inexpensive surrogate instead of the original reaction model for subsequent analyses such as calibration or optimization studies. Furthermore, the methodology is enhanced with a classification-based mixture PC formulation that overcomes the difficulties associated with representing potentially nonsmooth input-output relationships. Finally, the global sensitivity analysis based on the multiparameter spectral representation of an observable of interest provides biological insight and reveals the most important reactions and their couplings for the competence dynamics."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4852","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4852","fieldValue":"Response surface methodology,Uncertainty,Stochastic processes,Computational modeling,Noise,Computational biology,Bioinformatics,probability and statistics,Approximation,spectral methods"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4852","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4852","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4853","fieldValue":" A central biological process in all living organisms is gene translation. Developing a deeper understanding of this complex process may have ramifications to almost every biomedical discipline. Reuveni et al. recently proposed a new computational model of gene translation called the Ribosome Flow Model (RFM). In this paper, we consider a particular case of this model, called the Homogeneous Ribosome Flow Model (HRFM). From a biological viewpoint, this corresponds to the case where the transition rates of all the coding sequence codons are identical. This regime has been suggested recently based on experiments in mouse embryonic cells. We consider the steady-state distribution of the HRFM. We provide formulas that relate the different parameters of the model in steady state. We prove the following properties: 1) the ribosomal density profile is monotonically decreasing along the coding sequence; 2) the ribosomal density at each codon monotonically increases with the initiation rate; and 3) for a constant initiation rate, the translation rate monotonically decreases with the length of the coding sequence. In addition, we analyze the translation rate of the HRFM at the limit of very high and very low initiation rate, and provide explicit formulas for the translation rate in these two cases. We discuss the relationship between these theoretical results and biological findings on the translation process."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4853","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4853","fieldValue":"Computational modeling,Mathematical model,Biological system modeling,Bioinformatics,Steady-state,Encoding,Equations,constant elongation speed,Gene translation,systems biology,continued fractions,tridiagonal matrices,equilibrium point,monotone systems,translation elongation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4853","fieldValue":"ACM"}
