The primary goal of any indexing algorithm is to overcome high computational costs involved with comparing the query to every object in the database. This is achieved by efficient pruning in order to select only a small set of candidate matches. Vantage indexing is an indexing technique that belongs to the category of embedding or mapping approaches, because it maps a dissimilarity space onto a vector space such that traditional access methods can be used for querying. Each object is represented by a vector of dissimilarities to a small set of m reference objects, called vantage objects. Querying takes place within this vector space. The retrieval performance of a system based on this technique can be improved significantly through a proper choice of vantage objects. We propose a new technique for selecting vantage objects that addresses the retrieval performance directly, and present extensive experimental results based on three data sets of different size and modality, including a comparison with other selection strategies. The results clearly demonstrate both the efficacy and scalability of the proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25401","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25401","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25402","fieldValue":"Feng, Wu-Chi"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25402","fieldValue":" The ability to create super high-resolution video is becoming relative easy to do either through a single high-definition video camera or panoramic video that automatically stitches multiple views together. As an example of the former, the motion picture industry now has 6000 Ã\u2014 4000 pixel full-rate video cameras available. This means that supporting region-of-interest cropping will become more important in the future. In this article, we propose a mechanism to support region-of-interest adaptation of stored video. The proposed approach creates a compression-compliant stream (e.g., MPEG-2), while still allowing it to be cropped. Fortunately, video standards like MPEG-2 specify the format of a compliant stream, and not the algorithm to get there. As a result, there is an opportunity to allow system researchers and implementers ways to optimize for applications. We show various fundamental tradeoffs that are made in order to support region-of-interest cropping with super high-resolution video which we received from a local motion-picture firm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25402","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25402","fieldValue":"ACM"}
