{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21586","fieldValue":" The conventional approach for collecting data in sensor networks is the combination of automatic repeat-request techniques with a collection tree scheme in which all routes end up in the sink node. A high number of acknowledgments and retransmissions is the main drawback of this scheme. Erasure-correcting codes, in particular Fountain codes, can be employed to reduce the number of retransmissions. In the collection tree scheme, it is common for multiple routes to share a bottleneck. In such scenarios, to reach the optimal network throughput, it is necessary to combine the Fountain codes and Network Coding (NC) technique. Y-networks can be considered as an abstraction to this scenario. This article proposes a new algorithm, namely, Adaptive Distributed LT code (ADLT), for combining LT codes with NC in Y-networks. The ADLT algorithm enables belief propagation decoding by employing a novel technique called degree distribution updating, to preserve Robust Soliton degree distribution at destination. Unlike previously proposed algorithms in the literature, the ADLT algorithm has the flexibility to handle any number of sources with different block sizes and transmission rates, where sources perform standard LT coding. Simulation results confirm that the performance of the ADLT algorithm is close to that of standard LT code."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21586","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21586","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21587","fieldValue":"Abdelzaher, Tarek F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21587","fieldValue":" In this article we present SmartRoad, a crowd-sourced road sensing system that detects and identifies traffic regulators, traffic lights, and stop signs, in particular. As an alternative to expensive road surveys, SmartRoad works on participatory sensing data collected from GPS sensors from in-vehicle smartphones. The resulting traffic regulator information can be used for many assisted-driving or navigation systems. In order to achieve accurate detection and identification under realistic and practical settings, SmartRoad automatically adapts to different application requirements by (i) intelligently choosing the most appropriate information representation and transmission schemes, and (ii) dynamically evolving its core detection and identification engines to effectively take advantage of any external ground truth information or manual label opportunity. We implemented SmartRoad on a vehicular smartphone test bed, and deployed it on 35 external volunteer usersâ\u20AC™ vehicles for two months. Experiment results show that SmartRoad can robustly, effectively, and efficiently carry out the detection and identification tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21587","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21587","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21588","fieldValue":" Sensor nodes deployed outdoors for field surveillance are subject to environmental detriments. In this article, we propose a heterogeneous sensor network composed of sensor nodes with different environmental survivability to make it robust to environmental damage and keep it at a reasonable cost. We, for the first time, study the scheduling problem in such heterogeneous sensor networks for critical location surveillance applications. Our goal is to monitor all the critical points for as long as possible under different environmental conditions. We identify the underlying problem, theoretically prove its NP-complete nature, and propose a novel adaptive greedy scheduling algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm incorporates several heuristics to schedule the activity of both regular and robust sensors to monitor all the critical points, while at the same time minimizing and balancing the network energy consumption. Simulation results show that our algorithm efficiently solves the problem and outperforms other alternatives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21588","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21588","fieldValue":"ACM"}
