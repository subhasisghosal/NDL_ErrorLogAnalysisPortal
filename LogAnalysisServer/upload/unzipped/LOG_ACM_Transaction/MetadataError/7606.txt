Building on recent flow-based characterization of pairwise intersession network coding, the corresponding optimal rate-control problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem. The formulation exploits pairwise coding possibilities between any pair of sessions, where any coded symbol is formed by coding over at most two original symbols. The objective function is the sum of the utilities based on the rates supported by each unicast session. Working on the Lagrangian of the formulated problem, a distributed algorithm is developed with little coordination among intermediate nodes. Each unicast session has the freedom to choose its own utility function. The only information exchange required by the source is the weighted sum of the queue length of each link, which can be piggybacked to the acknowledgment messages. In addition to the optimal rate-control algorithm, we propose a decentralized pairwise random coding scheme that decouples the decision of coding from that of rate control, which further enhances the distributiveness of the proposed scheme. The convergence of the rate-control algorithm is proven analytically and verified by extensive simulations. Simulation results also demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art in terms of both throughput and fairness."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10022","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10022","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10022","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10023","fieldValue":"Campos-Nez, Enrique"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10023","fieldValue":" We introduce a set of algorithms for pricing calls on a multiclass loss network with unknown demand elasticity. The algorithms are design to observe the network and use real-time pricing to estimate demand elasticity and other unknown system parameters, and modify per-class prices in order to improve the long-run average revenue. The algorithms can be implemented online, have small memory and computational requirements, and are robust to parametric uncertainty. We provide sufficient conditions for the convergence of the algorithms to a local optimum, and illustrate their performance through numerous numerical examples. The paper also discusses how these algorithms can be distributed to multiple agents on a per-class basis, and provide bounds to error estimates introduced by our decoupling approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10023","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
