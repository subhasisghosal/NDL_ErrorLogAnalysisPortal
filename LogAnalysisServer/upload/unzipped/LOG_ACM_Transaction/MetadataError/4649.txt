However, current research on cross-layer design has been carried out in various piecemeal approaches, and lacks a methodological foundation to gain in-depth understanding of complex cross-layer behaviors such as multiscale temporal-spatial behavior, leading to a design paradox and\/or unmanageable design problems. In this article, we propose a theoretical framework for quantitative interaction measures, which is further extended to sensitivity analysis by quantifying the contribution made by each design variable and by the interactions among them on the design objective. Thus, the proposed framework can significantly enhance our capability for cross-layer behavior characterization and provide design insights for future design. Furthermore, a case study on cross-layer optimized wireless multimedia communications has been adopted to illustrate major cross-layer design trade-offs and validate the proposed framework. Both analytical and experimental results show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25017","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25017","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25018","fieldValue":" We propose a new framework for worst-case performance evaluation of MAC protocols for wireless ad hoc networks. Given a protocol, its performance metrics and a network topology, our framework first generates MAC scenarios which achieve poor performance at MAC level. In order to evaluate the impact of these MAC scenarios on the end performance, we model the interactions between MAC interface and the MAC layer using a state transition graph and generate high-level scenarios using enumeration techniques. These high-level scenarios can be simulated and compared with heuristics developed by others to identify high-level scenarios that are expected to lead to the worst-case end performance. In order to demonstrate its usefulness, we use our framework to evaluate the worst-case performance of IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol by generating a library of MAC- and high-level scenarios. We simulate the high-level scenarios to demonstrate that the scenarios we generate exhibit the worst performance among all the scenarios, including those generated by using heuristics recently proposed by other researchers."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25018","fieldValue":"Modeling the interactions between MAC and higher layer: A systematic approach to generate high-level scenarios from MAC-layer scenarios"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25018","fieldValue":"ACM"}
