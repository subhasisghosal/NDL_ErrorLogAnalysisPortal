Our approach, which we call Poisson matting, has the following advantages. First, the matte is directly reconstructed from a continuous matte gradient field by solving Poisson equations using boundary information from a user-supplied trimap. Second, by interactively manipulating the matte gradient field using a number of filtering tools, the user can further improve Poisson matting results locally until he or she is satisfied. The modified local result is seamlessly integrated into the final result. Experiments on many complex natural images demonstrate that Poisson matting can generate good matting results that are not possible using existing matting techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15402","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15402","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15403","fieldValue":" This paper presents an interactive system for designing and browsing volumetric illustrations. Volumetric illustrations are 3D models with internal textures that the user can browse by cutting the models at desired locations. To assign internal textures to a surface mesh, the designer cuts the mesh and provides simple guiding information to specify the correspondence between the cross-section and a reference 2D image. The guiding information is stored with the geometry and used during the synthesis of cross-sectional textures. The key idea is to synthesize a plausible cross-sectional image using a 2D texture-synthesis technique, instead of sampling from a complete 3D RGB volumetric representation directly. This simplifies the design interface and reduces the amount of data, making it possible for non-experts to rapidly design and use volumetric illustrations. We believe that our system can enrich human communications in various domains, such as medicine, biology, and geology."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15403","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15403","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15404","fieldValue":" We describe the use of traditional stereological methods to synthesize 3D solid textures from 2D images of existing materials. We first illustrate our approach for aggregate materials of spherical particles, and then extend the technique to apply to particles of arbitrary shapes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with side-by-side comparisons of a real material and a synthetic model with its appearance parameters derived from its physical counterpart. Unlike ad hoc methods for texture synthesis, stereology provides a disciplined, systematic basis for predicting material structure with well-defined assumptions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15404","fieldValue":"ACM"}
