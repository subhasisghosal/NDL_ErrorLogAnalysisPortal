The BLOSUM matrices, especially BLOSUM62, are the de facto standard matrices for protein alignments. However, after widely utilization of the matrices for 15 years, programming errors were surprisingly found in the initial version of source codes for their generation. And amazingly, after bug correction, the \"intended\" BLOSUM62 matrix performs consistently worse than the \"miscalculated\" one. In this paper, we find linear relationships among the eigenvalues of the matrices and propose an algorithm to find optimal unified eigenvectors. With them, we can parameterize matrix BLOSUMx for any given variable x that could change continuously. We compare the effectiveness of our parameterized isentropic matrix with BLOSUM62. Furthermore, an iterative alignment and matrix selection process is proposed to adaptively find the best parameter and globally align two sequences. Experiments are conducted on aligning 13,667 families of Pfam database and on clustering MHC II protein sequences, whose improved accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/5151","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, University of Missouri, Columbia, MI (Chen, Jiaxing); City University of Hong Kong, Department of Computer Science, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China (Li, Jin; Li, Shuai Cheng); Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin- Madison, Madison, WI (Fan, Jun); Key Lab of Intelligence Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China (Bu, Dongbo); Beijing Engineering Research Center of High Volume language Information Processing &#38; Cloud Computing Applications, School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China (Song, Dandan; Chen, Guang; Li, Ning)"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5151","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5151","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5151","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5152","fieldValue":" Single nucleotide polymorphisms, a dominant type of genetic variants, have been used successfully to identify defective genes causing human single gene diseases. However, most common human diseases are complex diseases and caused by gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Many SNP-SNP interaction analysis methods have been introduced but they are not powerful enough to discover interactions more than three SNPs. The paper proposes a novel method that analyzes all SNPs simultaneously. Different from existing methods, the method regards an individual's genotype data on a list of SNPs as a point with a unit of energy in a multi-dimensional space, and tries to find a new coordinate system where the energy distribution difference between cases and controls reaches the maximum. The method will find different multiple SNPs combinatorial patterns between cases and controls based on the new coordinate system. The experiment on simulated data shows that the method is efficient. The tests on the real data of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) disease show that it can find out more significant multi-SNP combinatorial patterns than existing methods."}
