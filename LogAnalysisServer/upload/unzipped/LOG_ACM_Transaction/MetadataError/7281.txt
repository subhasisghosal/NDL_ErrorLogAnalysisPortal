However, service providers are still facing the challenges arising from the special requirements for provisioning services at the optical layer. In this paper, we incorporate some realistic constraints into the static provisioning problem, and formulate it under different network resource availability conditions. We consider three classes of shared risk link group (SRLG)-diverse path protection schemes: dedicated, shared, and unprotected. We associate with each connection request a lightpath length constraint and a revenue value. When the network resources are not sufficient to accommodate all the connection requests, the static provisioning problem is formulated as a revenue maximization problem, whose objective is maximizing the total revenue value. When the network has sufficient resources, the problem becomes a capacity minimization problem with the objective of minimizing the number of used wavelength-links. We provide integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for these problems. Because solving these ILP problems is extremely time consuming, we propose a tabu search heuristic to solve these problems within a reasonable amount of time. We also develop a rerouting optimization heuristic, which is based on previous work. Experimental results are presented to compare the solutions obtained by the tabu search heuristic and the rerouting optimization heuristic. For both problems, the tabu search heuristic outperforms the rerouting optimization heuristic."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9379","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9379","fieldValue":"Shared risk link group (SRLG)-diverse path provisioning under hybrid service level agreements in wavelength-routed optical mesh networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8364","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9380","fieldValue":" Passive traffic measurement increasingly employs sampling at the packet level. Many high-end routers form flow statistics from a sampled substream of packets. Sampling controls the consumption of resources by the measurement operations. However, knowledge of the statistics of flows in the unsampled stream remains useful, for understanding both characteristics of source traffic, and consumption of resources in the network. This paper provides methods that use flow statistics formed from sampled packet stream to infer the frequencies of the number of packets per flow in the unsampled stream. A key task is to infer the properties of flows of original traffic that evaded sampling altogether. We achieve this through statistical inference, and by exploiting protocol level detail reported in flow records. We investigate the impact on our results of different versions of packet sampling."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9380","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
