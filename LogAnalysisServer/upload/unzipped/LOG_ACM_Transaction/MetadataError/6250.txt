As technology scales, it is imperative that applications are optimized to take full advantage of the underlying resources and meet both power and performance requirements. We propose MultiMaKe, an application mapping design flow capable of discovering and enabling parallelism opportunities via code transformations, efficiently distributing the computational load across resources, and minimizing unnecessary data transfers. Our approach decomposes the application's tasks into smaller units of computations called kernels, which are distributed and pipelined across the different processing resources. We exploit the ideas of inter-kernel data reuse to minimize unnecessary data transfers between kernels, early execution edges to drive performance, and kernel pipelining to increase system throughput. Our experimental results on JPEG and JPEG2000 show up to 97&percnt; off-chip memory access reduction, and up to 80&percnt; execution time reduction over standard mapping and task-level pipelining approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/6655","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2435227.2435255\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6655","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6655","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6656","fieldValue":"Hsieh, Jen-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6656","fieldValue":"Chang, Yuan-Hao"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6656","fieldValue":"Chu, Yuan-Sheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6656","fieldValue":" In recent years, low-cost flash-memory devices have contributed greatly to the rapid growth of the flash memory market. Given that the most of the cost of such devices is the cost of the flash-memory chips, many vendors are managing the cost of such devices by using flash-memory chips of low quality, and they will continue to do so in the near future. Recognizing strong market demand, this work presents a set-based mapping strategy with an effective implementation and low hardware resource requirements for making downgraded flash-memory chips useable in products. A configurable management design for managing chips of various qualities with improved lifetime is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is evaluated by performing a series of experiments and analyzed with reference to popular implementations in industry."}
