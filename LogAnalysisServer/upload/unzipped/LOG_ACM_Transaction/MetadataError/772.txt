With continued technology scaling in order to meet ever-increasing performance demands, it is no longer cost effective to design cooling systems that handle the worst-case thermal behaviors. Instead, cooling systems are designed to handle typical chip operation, while processors must detect and handle rare thermal emergencies. Most processors rely on measurements from integrated thermal sensors and dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques in order to manage the trade-off between performance and thermal risk. Optimal management requires advanced knowledge of the thermal trajectory based on the current workload behaviors and operating conditions. In this work, we devise novel workload phase classification strategies that automatically discriminate among workload behaviors with respect to the thermal control response. We incorporate workload phase-detection and thermal models into a dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique that can optimally control temperature during runtime based on thermal predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques in predicting and adaptively controlling the thermal behavior of a real quad-core processor in response to a wide range of workloads. In comparison with state-of-the-art model predictive control (MPC) techniques in previous works on thermal prediction, we demonstrate a 5.8&percnt; improvement in instruction throughput with the same number of thermal violations. In comparison with simple proportional-integral (PI) feedback control techniques, we improve instruction throughput by 3.9&percnt;, while significantly reducing the number of thermal violations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13302","fieldValue":"Jason Xue, Chun"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13302","fieldValue":" NAND flash memory has been employed as disk cache in recent years. It has the advantages of high performance, low leakage power, and cost efficiency. However, flash memory's performance is limited by the inability of in-place updates, coarse access granularity, and a limited number of write\/erase times. In this article, we propose a hybrid nonvolatile disk cache architecture for high-performance and energy-efficient systems, where the disk cache is implemented with a small-size phase change memory (PCM) and a large-size NAND flash memory. Compared with current flash memory-based disk cache, it has the following advantages. (1) System performance is improved as requests are carefully directed between PCM and flash memory; (2) the energy consumption of disk cache is substantially reduced with significant reduction of additional operations, such as garbage collections; (3) the efficiency of flash memory is improved with the reduction of write activities on flash memory; and (4) lifetime of NAND flash memory is increased with most of the write operations assigned to PCM, where PCM's lifetime is guaranteed to be longer than the lifetime of flash memory. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can substantially improve the system performance, energy consumption, and lifetime of the hybrid disk cache."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13302","fieldValue":"ACM"}
