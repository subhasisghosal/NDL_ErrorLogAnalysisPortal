By referring to relevant documents, individuals can understand how to alleviate their depression-related symptoms according to recommendations from health professionals. This work presents an extended probabilistic Hyperspace Analog to Language (epHAL) model to achieve this aim. The epHAL incorporates the close temporal associations between words in query documents to represent word cooccurrence relationships in a high-dimensional context space. The information flow mechanism further combines the query words in the epHAL space to infer related words for effective information retrieval. The language model perplexity is considered as the criterion for model optimization. Finally, the epHAL is adopted for psychiatric query document retrieval, and indicates its superiority in information retrieval over traditional approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23978","fieldValue":" combinFormation is a mixed-initiative creativity support tool for searching, browsing, organizing, and integrating information. Images and text are connected to represent surrogates (enhanced bookmarks), optimizing the use of human cognitive facilities. Composition, an alternative to lists and spatial hypertext, is used to represent a collection of surrogates as a connected whole, using principles from art and design. This facilitates the creative process of information discovery, in which humans develop new ideas while finding and collecting information. To provoke the user to think about the large space of potentially relevant information resources, a generative agent proactively engages in collecting information resources, forming image and text surrogates, and composing them visually. The agent develops the collection and its visual representation over time, enabling the user to see ideas and relationships. To keep the human in control, we develop interactive mechanisms for authoring the composition and directing the agent. In a field study in an interdisciplinary course on The Design Process, over a hundred students alternated using combinFormation and Google+Word to collect prior work on information discovery invention assignments. The students that used combinFormation's mixed-initiative composition of image and text surrogates performed better."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23978","fieldValue":"combinFormation: Mixed-initiative composition of image and text surrogates promotes information discovery"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23978","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23978","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23979","fieldValue":" This work explores the hypothesis that interactions between a trained human search intermediary and an information seeker can inform the design of interactive IR systems. We discuss results from a controlled Wizard-of-Oz case study, set in the context of the TREC 2005 HARD track evaluation, in which a trained intermediary executed an integrated search and interaction strategy based on conceptual facet analysis and informed by need negotiation techniques common in reference interviews. Having a human â\u20ACœin the loopâ\u20AC? yielded large improvements over fully automated systems as measured by standard ranked-retrieval metrics, demonstrating the value of mediated search. We present a detailed analysis of the intermediary's actions to gain a deeper understanding of what worked and why. One contribution is a taxonomy of clarification types informed both by empirical results and existing theories in library and information science. We discuss how these findings can guide the development of future systems. Overall, this work illustrates how studying human information-seeking processes can lead to better information retrieval applications."}
