The key to this speedup is replacing ACM's timid, forward-looking mechanism for detecting collisions---locating and rescheduling separating plane kinetic data structures---with an optimistic speculative method inspired by Mirtich's rigid body Time Warp algorithm [2000]. Time warp allows us to perform collision detection over a window of time containing many of ACM's asynchronous trajectory changes; in this way we cull away large intervals as being collision free. Moreover, by replacing force processing intermingled with KDS rescheduling by windows of pure processing followed by collision detection, we transform an algorithm that is very difficult to parallelize into one that is embarrassingly parallel."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16740","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16740","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16741","fieldValue":"OBrien, James F."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16741","fieldValue":" We present a technique for cloth simulation that dynamically refines and coarsens triangle meshes so that they automatically conform to the geometric and dynamic detail of the simulated cloth. Our technique produces anisotropic meshes that adapt to surface curvature and velocity gradients, allowing efficient modeling of wrinkles and waves. By anticipating buckling and wrinkle formation, our technique preserves fine-scale dynamic behavior. Our algorithm for adaptive anisotropic remeshing is simple to implement, takes up only a small fraction of the total simulation time, and provides substantial computational speedup without compromising the fidelity of the simulation. We also introduce a novel technique for strain limiting by posing it as a nonlinear optimization problem. This formulation works for arbitrary non-uniform and anisotropic meshes, and converges more rapidly than existing solvers based on Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel iterations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16742","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a new generative statistical model that allows for human motion analysis and synthesis at both semantic and kinematic levels. Our key idea is to decouple complex variations of human movements into finite structural variations and continuous style variations and encode them with a concatenation of morphable functional models. This allows us to model not only a rich repertoire of behaviors but also an infinite number of style variations within the same action. Our models are appealing for motion analysis and synthesis because they are highly structured, contact aware, and semantic embedding. We have constructed a compact generative motion model from a huge and heterogeneous motion database (about two hours mocap data and more than 15 different actions). We have demonstrated the power and effectiveness of our models by exploring a wide variety of applications, ranging from automatic motion segmentation, recognition, and annotation, and online\/offline motion synthesis at both kinematics and behavior levels to semantic motion editing. We show the superiority of our model by comparing it with alternative methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16742","fieldValue":"ACM"}
