Unlike traditional placement, the problem for DRFPGAs must consider the precedence constraints among logic components. For the placement, we develop an effective metric that can consider wirelength, register requirement, and power consumption simultaneously. With the considerations of the new metric and the precedence constraints, we then present a three-stage scheme of partitioning, initial placement generation, and placement refinement to solve the new placement problem. Experimental results show that our placement scheme with the new metric achieves respective improvements of 17.2, 27.0, and 35.9&percnt; in wirelength, the number of registers, and power consumption requirements, compared with the list scheduling method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12852","fieldValue":"Marek-Sadowska, Malgorzata"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12852","fieldValue":" We utilize Rent's rule as an empirical measure for efficient clustering and placement of circuits in clustered Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We show that careful matching of resource availability and design complexity during the clustering and placement processes can contribute to spatial uniformity in the placed design, leading to overall device decongestion after routing. We present experimental results to show that appropriate logic depopulation during clustering can have a positive impact on the overall FPGA device area. Our clustering and placement techniques can improve the overall device routing area by as much as 62&percnt;, 35&percnt; on average, for the same array size, when compared to state-of-the-art FPGA clustering, placement, and routing tools. Power dissipation simulations using a typical buffered pass-transistor-based FPGA interconnect model are also presented.
