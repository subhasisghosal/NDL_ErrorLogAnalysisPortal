Prior approaches target improving responsiveness by reducing the tail latency, or high-percentile response time, of an individual search server. They predict query execution time, and if a query is predicted to be long-running, it runs in parallel; otherwise, it runs sequentially. These approaches are, however, not accurate enough for reducing a high tail latency when responses are aggregated from many servers because this requires each server to reduce a substantially higher tail latency (e.g., the 99.99th percentile), which we call extreme tail latency. To address tighter requirements of extreme tail latency, we propose a new design space for the problem, subsuming existing work and also proposing a new solution space. Existing work makes a prediction using features available at indexing time and focuses on optimizing prediction features for accelerating tail queries. In contrast, we identify â\u20ACœwhen to predict?â\u20AC? as another key optimization question. This opens up a new solution of delaying a prediction by a short duration to allow many short-running queries to complete without parallelization and, at the same time, to allow the predictor to collect a set of dynamic features using runtime information. This new question expands a solution space in two meaningful ways. First, we see a significant reduction of tail latency by leveraging â\u20ACœdynamicâ\u20AC? features collected at runtime that estimate query execution time with higher accuracy. Second, we can ask whether to override prediction when the â\u20ACœpredictabilityâ\u20AC? is low. We show that considering predictability accelerates the query by achieving a higher recall. With this prediction, we propose to accelerate the queries that are predicted to be long-running. In our preliminary work, we focused on parallelization as an acceleration scenario. We extend to consider heterogeneous multicore hardware for acceleration. This hardware combines processor cores with different microarchitectures such as energy-efficient little cores and high-performance big cores, and accelerating web search using this hardware has remained an open problem. We evaluate the proposed prediction framework in two scenarios: (1) query parallelization on a multicore processor and (2) query scheduling on a heterogeneous processor. Our extensive evaluation results show that, for both scenarios of query acceleration using parallelization and heterogeneous cores, the proposed framework is effective in reducing the extreme tail latency compared to a start-of-the-art predictor because of its higher recall, and it improves server throughput by more than 70&percnt; because of its improved precision."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23346","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23346","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23347","fieldValue":" Eye tracking studies have widely been used in improving the design and usability of web pages and in the research of understanding how users navigate them. However, there is limited research in clustering usersâ\u20AC™ eye movement sequences (i.e., scanpaths) on web pages to identify a general direction they follow. Existing research tends to be reductionist, which means that the resulting path is so short that it is not useful. Moreover, there is little work on correlating usersâ\u20AC™ scanpaths with visual elements of web pages and the underlying source code, which means the result cannot be used for further processing. In order to address these limitations, we introduce a new concept in clustering scanpaths called Scanpath Trend Analysis (STA) that not only considers the visual elements visited by all users, but also considers the visual elements visited by the majority in any order. We present an algorithm which automatically does this trend analysis to identify a trending scanpath for multiple web users in terms of visual elements of a web page. In contrast to existing research, the STA algorithm first analyzes the most visited visual elements in given scanpaths, clusters the scanpaths by arranging these visual elements based on their overall positions in the individual scanpaths, and then constructs a trending scanpath in terms of these visual elements. This algorithm was experimentally evaluated by an eye tracking study on six web pages for two different kinds of tasks (12 cases in total). Our experimental results show that the STA algorithm generates a trending scanpath that addresses the reductionist problem of existing work by preventing the loss of commonly visited visual elements for all cases. Based on the statistical tests, the STA algorithm also generates a trending scanpath that is significantly more similar to the inputted scanpaths compared to other existing work in 10 out of 12 cases. In the remaining cases, the STA algorithm still performs significantly better than some other existing work. This algorithm contributes to behavior analysis research on the web that can be used for different purposes: for example, re-engineering web pages guided by the trending scanpath to improve usersâ\u20AC™ experience or guiding designers to improve their design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23348","fieldValue":" Machine learning algorithms and recommender systems trained on human ratings are widely in use today. However, human ratings may be associated with a high level of uncertainty and are subjective, influenced by demographic or psychological factors. We propose a new approach to the design of object classes from human ratings: the use of entire distributions to construct classes. By avoiding aggregation for class definition, our approach loses no information and can deal with highly volatile or conflicting ratings. The approach is based the concept of the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), a measure of distance for distributions. We evaluate the proposed approach based on four datasets obtained from diverse Web content or movie quality evaluation services or experiments. We show that clusters discovered in these datasets using the EMD measure are characterized by a consistent and simple interpretation. Quality classes defined using entire rating distributions can be fitted to clusters of distributions in the four datasets using two parameters, resulting in a good overall fit. We also consider the impact of the composition of small samples on the distributions that are the basis of our classification approach. We show that using distributions based on small samples of 10 evaluations is still robust to several demographic and psychological variables. This observation suggests that the proposed approach can be used in practice for quality evaluation, even for highly uncertain and subjective ratings."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/23348","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology (Rafalak, Maria; Deja, Dominik; Nielek, Radosaw; Kkol, Micha); Wroc&#322;aw University of Technology (Wierzbicki, Adam)"}
