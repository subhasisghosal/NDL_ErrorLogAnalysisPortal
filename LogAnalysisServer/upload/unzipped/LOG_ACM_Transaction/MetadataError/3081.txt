A key concern in DRE systems is determining the spatial deployment topology, which is how the software components map to the underlying hardware components. Optimizations, such as placing software components with high-frequency communications on processors that are closer together, can yield a number of important benefits, such as reduced power consumption due to decreased wireless transmission power required to communicate between the processing nodes. Determining a spatial deployment plan across a series of processors that will minimize power consumption is hard since the spatial deployment plan must respect a combination of real-time scheduling, fault-tolerance, resource, and other complex constraints. This article presents a hybrid heuristic\/evolutionary algorithm, called ScatterD, for automatically generating spatial deployment plans that minimize power consumption. This work provides the following contributions to the study of spatial deployment optimization for power consumption minimization: (1) it combines heuristic bin-packing with an evolutionary algorithm to produce a hybrid algorithm with excellent deployment derivation capabilities and scalability, (2) it shows how a unique representation of the spatial deployment solution space integrates the heuristic and evolutionary algorithms, and (3) it analyzes the results of experiments performed with data derived from a large-scale avionics system that compares ScatterD with other automated deployment techniques. These results show that ScatterD reduces power consumption by between 6&percnt; and 240&percnt; more than standard bin-packing, genetic, and particle swarm optimization algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1212","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1212","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2935","fieldValue":" Support Vector Machines (SVM) have obtained state-of-the-art results on many applications including document classification. However, previous works on applying SVMs to the F-term patent classification task did not obtain as good results as other learning algorithms such as kNN. This is due to the fact that F-term patent classification is different from conventional document classification in several aspects, mainly because it is a multiclass, multilabel classification problem with semi-structured documents and multi-faceted hierarchical categories. This article describes our SVM-based system and several techniques we developed successfully to adapt SVM for the specific features of the F-term patent classification task. We evaluate the techniques using the NTCIR-6 F-term classification terms assigned to Japanese patents. Moreover, our system participated in the NTCIR-6 patent classification evaluation and obtained the best results according to two of the three metrics used for task performance evaluation. Following the NTCIR-6 participation, we developed two new techniques, which achieved even better scores using all three NTCIR-6 metrics, effectively outperforming all participating systems. This article presents this new work and the experimental results that demonstrate the benefits of the latest approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2935","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2935","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20226","fieldValue":"Joung, Yuh-Jzer"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20226","fieldValue":" A first-order multiparty interaction is an abstraction mechanism that defines communication among a set of formal process roles. Actual processes participate in a first-order interaction by enroling into roles, and execution of the interaction can proceed when all roles are filled by distinct processes. As in CSP, enrolement statements can serve as guards in alternative commands. The enrolement guard-scheduling problem then is to enable the execution of first-order interactions through the judicious scheduling of roles to processes that are currently ready to execute enrolement guards.We present a fully distributed and message-efficient algorithm for the enrolement guard-scheduling problem, the first such solution of which we are aware. We also describe several extensions of the algorithm, including: generic roles; dynamically changing environments, where processes can be created and destroyed at run time; and nested-enrolement, which allows interactions to be nested."}
