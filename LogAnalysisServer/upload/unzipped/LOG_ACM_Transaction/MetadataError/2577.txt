These formulas, called recursive monotone stable (RMS) formulas, allow applying higher order or compound rules without wasting previously computed functional values. An exhaustive search shows the existence of 27 families of RMS formulas, stemming from the simple trapezoidal rule."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18680","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18680","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18681","fieldValue":" Two automatic adaptive integrators from QUADPACK (namely, QAG, and QAGS) are modified by substituting the Gauss-Kronrod rules used for local quadrature with recursive monotone stable (RMS) formulas.

Based on the same integrand evaluations that we need for approximating the integral, one may, for many quadrature rules, compute a sequence of null rule approximations. These null rule approximations are then used to produce an estimate of the local error. The algorithm allows us to take advantage of the degree of precision of the basic quadrature rule. In the experiments we show that the algorithm works satisfactorily for a selection of different quadrature rules on all test families of integrals."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18682","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18682","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18683","fieldValue":" This paper describes an extension to the set of Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms.
