Patterns from Gene Expression (PaGE) and q-values are two of the well-known approaches developed to handle this problem. This paper proposes a powerful approach to handle this problem. We first propose a method for estimating the prior probabilities used in the first version of the PaGE algorithm. This way, the problem definition of PaGE stays intact and we just estimate the needed prior probabilities. Our estimation method is similar to Storey's estimator without being its direct extension. Then, we modify the problem formulation to find significantly differentially expressed genes and present an efficient method for finding them. This formulation increases the power by directly incorporating Storey's estimator. We report the preliminary results on the BRCA data set to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4244","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4245","fieldValue":" In this paper, correlation of the pixels comprising a microarray spot is investigated. Subsequently, correlation statistics, namely, Pearson correlation and Spearman rank correlation, are used to segment the foreground and background intensity of microarray spots. The performance of correlation-based segmentation is compared to clustering-based (PAM, k-means) and seeded-region growing techniques (SPOT). It is shown that correlation-based segmentation is useful in flagging poorly hybridized spots, thus minimizing false-positives. The present study also raises the intriguing question of whether a change in correlation can be an indicator of differential gene expression."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4245","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4245","fieldValue":"Microarrays, image segmentation, Morgera's covariance complexity, Pearson's correlation, Spearman's rank correlation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4245","fieldValue":"ACM"}
