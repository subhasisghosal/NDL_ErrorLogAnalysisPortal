{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1448","fieldValue":" As levels of awareness surrounding accessibility increase, designers often look towards using nonvisual technologies to make existing graphical interfaces (e.g. Web pages) more inclusive. As existing haptic design guidance is not targeted to the specific needs of blind Web users, inappropriate touchable representations of graphical objects may be developed and integrated with Web interfaces, thereby reducing the quality of the browsing experience. This paper describes the evaluation of haptic HTML mappings that were developed using a participatory-design based technique, and presented using the Logitech Wingman force-feedback mouse. Findings have shown that participants were able to identify objects presented haptically, and develop a structural representation of layout from exploring content. Participants were able to perform a range of Web-based tasks that were previously found to be difficult for some blind users when using a screen reader alone. The haptic HTML mappings are presented, along with recommendations for their application derived from a validation study. The design guidance presented offers a standard reference tool for Web designers wanting to develop an accessible browsing application, using the benefits offered by a force-feedback mouse."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1448","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1448","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5263","fieldValue":" Phenotype classification via genomic data is hampered by small sample sizes that negatively impact classifier design. Utilization of prior biological knowledge in conjunction with training data can improve both classifier design and error estimation via the construction of the optimal Bayesian classifier. In the genomic setting, gene\/protein signaling pathways provide a key source of biological knowledge. Although these pathways are neither complete, nor regulatory, with no timing associated with them, they are capable of constraining the set of possible models representing the underlying interaction between molecules. The aim of this paper is to provide a framework and the mathematical tools to transform signaling pathways to prior probabilities governing uncertainty classes of feature-label distributions used in classifier design. Structural motifs extracted from the signaling pathways are mapped to a set of constraints on a prior probability on a Multinomial distribution. Being the conjugate prior for the Multinomial distribution, we propose optimization paradigms to estimate the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution in the Bayesian setting. The performance of the proposed methods is tested on two widely studied pathways: mammalian cell cycle and a p53 pathway model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5263","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5263","fieldValue":"An Optimization-Based Framework for the Transformation of Incomplete Biological Knowledge into a Probabilistic Structure and Its Application to the Utilization of Gene\/Protein Signaling Pathways in Discrete Phenotype Classification"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5263","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5263","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5264","fieldValue":"Cheng, Kin-On"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5264","fieldValue":"Law, Ngai-Fong"}
