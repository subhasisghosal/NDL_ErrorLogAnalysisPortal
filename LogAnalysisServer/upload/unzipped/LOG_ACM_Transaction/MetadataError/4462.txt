{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24406","fieldValue":" The increasing demand for high-bandwidth applications such as video-on-demand and grid computing is reviving interest in bandwidth reservation schemes. Earlier attempts did not catch on for a number of reasons, notably lack of interest on the part of the bandwidth providers. This, in turn, was partially caused by the lack of an efficient way of charging for bandwidth. Thus, the viability of bandwidth reservation depends on the existence of an efficient market where bandwidth-related transactions can take place. For this market to be effective, it must be efficient for both the provider (seller) and the user (buyer) of the bandwidth. This implies that: (a) the buyer must have a wide choice of providers that operate in a competitive environment, (b) the seller must be assured that a QoS transaction will be paid by the customer, and (c) the QoS transaction establishment must have low overheads so that it may be used by individual customers without a significant burden to the provider. In order to satisfy these requirements, we propose a framework that allows customers to purchase bandwidth using an open market where providers advertise links and capacities and customers bid for these services. The model is close to that of a commodities market that offers both advance bookings (futures) and a spot market. We explore the mechanisms that can support such a model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24407","fieldValue":" As large-scale online simulations such as Second Life and World of Warcraft are gaining economic significance, there is a growing incentive for attacks against such simulation software. We focus on attacks against the semantic integrity of the simulation. This class of attacks exploits the client-server architecture and is specific to online simulations which, for performance reasons, have to delegate the detailed rendering of the simulated world to the clients. Attacks against semantic integrity often compromise the physical laws of the simulated worldâ\u20AC\u201Denabling the user's simulation persona to fly, walk through walls, or to run faster than anybody else. We introduce the Secure Semantic Integrity Protocol (SSIP), which enables the simulation provider to audit the client computations. Then we analyze the security and scalability of SSIP. First, we show that under standard cryptographic assumptions SSIP will detect semantic integrity attacks. Second, we analyze the network overhead, and determine the optimum tradeoff between cost of bandwidth and audit frequency for our protocol."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24408","fieldValue":"Huang, Tzu-Chi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24408","fieldValue":"Shieh, Ce-Kuen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24408","fieldValue":" Network Address Translation (NAT) alleviates the shortage of IPv4 addresses but incurs peer-to-peer communication, application functionality and packet integrity problems. To date, no approach has yet been proposed to solve these three problems. By exploiting mobile agent and active networking technologies, we propose a Programmable Network Address Translation (PNAT) implementation that enables peer-to-peer communication while maintaining application functionality and packet integrity. For peer-to-peer communication, our proposed PNAT approach works for various NAT types (including the Symmetric NAT) with simple APIs supported by our proposed NAT design. For application functionality, the PNAT uses the mobile code to update protocol information in packet payloads according to different application needs. For packet integrity, the PNAT allows applications to delay their data encryption until NAT begins to translate addresses and ports in packet headers. To validate our proposed PNAT approach, we implemented the PNAT design on Windows 2000, and we present an empirical performance evaluation of the implemented design."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24408","fieldValue":"NAT"}
