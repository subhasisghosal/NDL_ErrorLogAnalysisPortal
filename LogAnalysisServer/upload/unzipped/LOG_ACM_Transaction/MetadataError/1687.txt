The key points of our approach include the use of a potential field derived from guide geometry and an implicit constraint surface to create nonpenetrating feather geometry. Our method is frame independent and produces visually smooth animation that is free from popping and other visual artifacts. We provide details of the implementation and examples of the technique applied to an animated character with several thousand feathers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16050","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16050","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16051","fieldValue":" 2D splines are a powerful tool for shape modeling, either parametrically or implicitly. However, compared with regular grid-based tensor-product splines, most of the high-dimensional spline techniques based on nonregular 2D polygons, such as box spline and simplex spline, are generally very expensive to evaluate. Though they have many desirable mathematical properties and have been proved theoretically to be powerful in graphics modeling, they are not a convenient graphics modeling technique in terms of practical implementation. In shape modeling practice, we still lack a simple and practical procedure in creating a set of bivariate spline basis functions from an arbitrarily specified 2D polygonal mesh. Solving this problem is of particular importance in using 2D algebraic splines for implicit modeling, as in this situation underlying implicit equations need to be solved quickly and accurately. In this article, a new type of bivariate spline function is introduced. This newly proposed type of bivariate spline function can be created from any given set of 2D polygons that partitions the 2D plane with any required degree of smoothness. In addition, the spline basis functions created with the proposed procedure are piecewise polynomials and can be described explicitly in analytical form. As a result, they can be evaluated efficiently and accurately. Furthermore, they have all the good properties of conventional 2D tensor-product-based B-spline basis functions, such as non-negativity, partition of unit, and convex-hull property. Apart from their obvious use in designing freeform parametric geometric shapes, the proposed 2D splines have been shown a powerful tool for implicit shape modeling."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16051","fieldValue":"CSG"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16051","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16051","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16052","fieldValue":" Many problems in computer graphics involve integrations of products of functions. Double- and triple-product integrals are commonly used in applications such as all-frequency relighting or importance sampling, but are limited to distant illumination. In contrast, near-field lighting from planar area lights involves an affine transform of the source radiance at different points in space. Our main contribution is a novel affine double- and triple-product integral theory; this generalization enables one of the product functions to be scaled and translated. We study the computational complexity in a number of bases, with particular attention to the common Haar wavelets. We show that while simple analytic formulae are not easily available, there is considerable sparsity that can be exploited computationally. We demonstrate a practical application to compute near-field lighting from planar area sources, that can be easily combined with most relighting algorithms. We also demonstrate initial results for wavelet importance sampling with near-field area lights, and image processing directly in the wavelet domain."}
