To address this problem, this article introduces an approach called incremental formalization, in which, first, users express information informally and then the system aids them in formalizing it. Incremental formalization requires a system architecture the (1) integrates formal and informal representations and (2) supports progressive formalization of information. The system should have both tools to capture naturally available informal information and techniques to suggest possible formalizations of this information. The hyper-object substrate (HOS) was developed to satisfy these requirements. HOS has been applied to a number of problem domains, including network design, archeological site analysis, and neuroscience education. Users have been successful in adding informal information and then later formalizing it incrementally with the aid of the system. Our experience with HOS has reaffirmed the need for information spaces to evolve during use and has identified additional considerations in the design and instantiation of systems enabling and supporting incremental formalization"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23805","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23805","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23806","fieldValue":" In networked IR, a client submits a query to a broker, which is in contact with a large number of databases. In order to yield a maximum number of documents at minimum cost, the broker has to make estimates about the retrieval cost of each database, and then decide for each database whether or not to use it for the current query, and if, how many documents to retrieve from it. For this purpose, we develop a general decision-theoretic model and discuss different cost structures. Besides cost for retrieving relevant versus nonrelevant documents, we consider the following parameters for each database: expected retrieval quality, expected number of relevant documents in the database and cost factors for query processing and document delivery. For computing the overall optimum, a divide-and-conquer algorithm is given. If there are several brokers knowing different databases, a preselection of brokers can only be performed heuristically, but the computation of the optimum can be done similarily to the single-broker case. In addition, we derive a formula which estimates the number of relevant documents in a database based on dictionary information."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23807","fieldValue":" Searching online text collections can be both rewarding and frustrating. While valuable information can be found, typically many irrelevant documents are also retrieved, while many relevant ones are missed. Terminology mismatches between the user's query and document contents are a main cause of retrieval failures. Expanding a user's query with related words can improve search performances, but finding and using related words is an open problem. This research uses corpus analysis techniques to automatically discover similar words directly from the contents of the databases which are not tagged with part-of-speech labels. Using these similarities, user queries are automatically expanded, resulting in conceptual retrieval rather than requiring exact word matches between queries and documents. We are able to achieve a 7.6% improvement for TREC 5 queries and up to a 28.5% improvement on the narrow-domain Cystic Fibrosis collection. This work has been extended to multidatabase collections where each subdatabase has a collection-specific similarity matrix associated with it. If the best matrix is selected, substantial search improvements are possible. Various techniques to select the appropriate matrix for a particular query are analyzed, and a 4.8% improvement in the results is validated."}
