Particular attention is given to processing Korean texts that may contain users' grammatical and practical errors. In order to treat these errors efficiently, the system includes methods based on asymmetric relations from which partial parsing and the potential governing relationship are derived, implying the starting point for checking, the direction for parsing, and the limits of the scope for parsing.To organize partial parsing efficiently, the system requires an appropriate knowledge base. As its essential prerequisites, this study (a) considers the factors from which the various error types encountered while parsing various Korean texts arise; (b) extracts general patterns from the linguistic or extra-linguistic factors obtained in this manner; and (c) demonstrates how the system, based on a linguistic analysis, procures an adequate knowledge base for partial parsing to satisfy end-users. Mirine 2.2 achieves an F-measure of about 0.80 in detecting unknown erroneous words; an F-measure of about 0.98 when not considering unknown words; and 98.94% precision in correcting erroneous words."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2830","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2830","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18916","fieldValue":" Unrestricted control polyhedra facilitate modeling free-form surfaces of arbitrary topology and local patch-layout by allowing n-sided, possibly nonplanar, facets and m-valent vertices. By cutting off edges and corners, the smoothing of an unrestricted control polyhedron can be reduced to the smoothing of a planar-cut polyhedron. A planar-cut polyhedron is a generalization of the well-known tensor-product control structure. The routine Pcp2Nurb in turn translates planar-cut polyhedra to a collection of four-sided linearly trimmed bicubic B-splines and untrimmed biquadratic B-splines. The routine can thus serve as central building block for overcoming topological constraints in the mathematical modeling of smooth surfaces that are stored, transmitted, and rendered using only the standard representation in industry. Specifically, on input of a nine-point subnet of a planar-cut polyhedron, the routine outputs a trimmed bicubic NURBS patch. If the subnet does not have geometrically redundant edges, this patch joins smoothly with patches from adjacent subnets as a four-sided piece of a regular C1 surface. The patch integrates smoothly with untrimmed biquadratic tensor-product surfaces derived from subnets with tensor-product structure. Sharp features can be retained in this representation by using geometrically redundant edges in the planar-cut polyhedron. The resulting surface follows the outlines of the planar-cut polyhedron in the manner traditional tensor-product splines follow the outline of their rectilinear control polyhedron. In particular, it stays in the local convex hull of the planar-cut polyhedron."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/18916","fieldValue":"<italic>C<supscrpt>1<\/supscrpt><\/italic> surface"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18916","fieldValue":"NURBS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18916","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18916","fieldValue":"ACM"}
