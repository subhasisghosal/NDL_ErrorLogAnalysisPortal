This article proposes a novel method for image annotation based on combining feature-word distributions, which map from visual space to word space, and word-topic distributions, which form a structure to capture label relationships for annotation. We refer to this type of model as Feature-Word-Topic models. The introduction of topics allows us to efficiently take word associations, such as &lcub;ocean, fish, coral&rcub; or &lcub;desert, sand, cactus&rcub;, into account for image annotation. Unlike previous topic-based methods, we do not consider topics as joint distributions of words and visual features, but as distributions of words only. Feature-word distributions are utilized to define weights in computation of topic distributions for annotation. By doing so, topic models in text mining can be applied directly in our method. Our Feature-word-topic model, which exploits Gaussian Mixtures for feature-word distributions, and probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) for word-topic distributions, shows that our method is able to obtain promising results in image annotation and retrieval."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23269","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23269","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23270","fieldValue":" Contextual advertising can be viewed as an information filtering task aimed at selecting suitable ads to be suggested to the final â\u20ACœuserâ\u20AC?, that is, the Web page in hand. Starting from this insight, in this article we propose a novel system, which adopts a collaborative filtering approach to perform contextual advertising. In particular, given a Web page, the system relies on collaborative filtering to classify the page content and to suggest suitable ads accordingly. Useful information is extracted from â\u20ACœinlinksâ\u20AC?, that is, similar pages that link to the Web page in hand. In so doing, collaborative filtering is used in a content-based setting, giving rise to a hybrid contextual advertising system. After being implemented, the system has been experimented with about 15000 Web pages extracted from the Open Directory Project. Comparative experiments with a content-based system have been performed. The corresponding results highlight that the proposed system performs better. A suitable case study is also provided to enable the reader to better understand how the system works and its effectiveness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23270","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23270","fieldValue":"ACM"}
