One possible approach is to perform dynamic bandwidth reservation based on mobility predictions. With the rapid advances in mobile positioning technology, and the widespread availability of digital road maps previously designed for navigational devices, we propose a predictive bandwidth reservation scheme built upon these timely opportunities. In contrast to the common practice of utilizing only incoming handoff predictions at each cell to compute the reservations, our scheme is more efficient as it innovatively utilizes both incoming and outgoing handoff predictions; it can meet the same target handoff dropping probability by blocking fewer new calls. The individual base stations are responsible for the computations, which are shown to be simple enough to be performed in real-time. We evaluate the scheme via simulation, along with five other schemes for comparison. Simulation results show that those schemes that rely on positioning information are significantly more efficient than those that do not. Our scheme's additional use of the road topology information further improves upon this advantage, bringing the efficiency closer to the bound set by a benchmark scheme that assumes perfect knowledge about future handoffs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9565","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9566","fieldValue":" In this paper, we develop failure-resilient techniques for monitoring link delays and faults in a Service Provider or Enterprise IP network. Our two-phased approach attempts to minimize both the monitoring infrastructure costs as well as the additional traffic due to probe messages. In the first phase, we compute the locations of a minimal set of monitoring stations such that all network links are covered, even in the presence of several link failures. Subsequently, in the second phase, we compute a minimal set of probe messages that are transmitted by the stations to measure link delays and isolate network faults. We show that both the station selection problem as well as the probe assignment problem are NP-hard. We then propose greedy approximation algorithms that achieve a logarithmic approximation factor for the station selection problem and a constant factor for the probe assignment problem. These approximation ratios are provably very close to the best possible bounds for any algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9566","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
