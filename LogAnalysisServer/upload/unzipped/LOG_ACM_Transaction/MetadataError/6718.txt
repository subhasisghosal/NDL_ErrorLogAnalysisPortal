Articles accrue information through the asynchronous editing of users who arrive both seeking information and possibly able to contribute information. Most articles stabilize to high-quality, trusted sources of information representing the collective wisdom of all the users who edited the article. We propose a model for information growth which relies on two main observations: (i) as an articleâ\u20AC™s quality improves, it attracts visitors at a faster rate (a rich-get-richer phenomenon); and, simultaneously, (ii) the chances that a new visitor will improve the article drops (there is only so much that can be said about a particular topic). Our model is able to reproduce many features of the edit dynamics observed on Wikipedia; in particular, it captures the observed rise in the edit rate, followed by 1\/t decay. Despite differences in the media, we also document similar features in the comment rates for a segment of the LiveJournal blogosphere."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7928","fieldValue":"Yu, Philip S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7928","fieldValue":" This article studies evolutionary clustering, a recently emerged hot topic with many important applications, noticeably in dynamic social network analysis. In this article, based on the recent literature on nonparametric Bayesian models, we have developed two generative models: DPChain and HDP-HTM. DPChain is derived from the Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model, with an exponential decaying component along with the time. HDP-HTM combines the hierarchical dirichlet process (HDP) with a hierarchical transition matrix (HTM) based on the proposed Infinite hierarchical Markov state model (iHMS). Both models substantially advance the literature on evolutionary clustering, in the sense that not only do they both perform better than those in the existing literature, but more importantly, they are capable of automatically learning the cluster numbers and explicitly addressing the corresponding issues. Extensive evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness and the promise of these two solutions compared to the state-of-the-art literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7928","fieldValue":"HDP-HTM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7928","fieldValue":"IHMS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7928","fieldValue":"ACM"}
