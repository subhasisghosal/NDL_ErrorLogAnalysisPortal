{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21373","fieldValue":" Broadcast is an efficient communication channel on wireless sensor networks. Through authentic broadcast, deployed sensors can perform legitimate actions issued by a base station. According to previous literature, a complete solution for authentic broadcast is digital signature based on asymmetric cryptography. However, asymmetric cryptography utilizes expensive operations, which result in computational bottlenecks. Among these cryptosystems, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) seems to be the most efficient and the most popular choice. Unfortunately, signature verification in ECC is not efficient enough. In this article, we propose an authentic broadcast scheme based on RSA. Unlike conventional approaches, the proposed scheme adopts short moduli to enhance performance. Meanwhile, the weakness of short moduli can be fixed with rekeying strategies. To minimize the rekeying overhead, a Multi-Modulus RSA generation algorithm, which can reduce communication overhead by 50&percnt;, is proposed. We implemented the proposed scheme on MICAz. On 512-bit moduli, each verification spends at most 0.077 seconds, which is highly competitive with other public-key cryptosystems."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21373","fieldValue":"RSA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21374","fieldValue":" False data filtering schemes are designed to filter out false data injected by malicious sensors; they keep the network immune to bogus event reports. Theoretic understanding of false data filtering schemes and guidelines to further improve their designs are still lacking. This article first presents an information-theoretic model of false data filtering schemes. From the information-theoretic view, we define the scheme's filtering capacity $C_Fi$ as the uncertainty-reduction ratio of the target input variable, given the output. This metric not only performs better than existing metrics but also implies that only by optimizing the false negative rate and false positive rate simultaneously, can we promote a scheme's overall performance. Based on the investigation from the modeling efforts, we propose HiFi, a hybrid authentication-based false data filtering scheme. HiFi leverages the benefits of both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography and achieves a high filtering capacity, as well as low computation and communication overhead. Performance analysis demonstrates that our proposed metric is rational and useful, and that HiFi is effective and energy efficient."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21375","fieldValue":" In clustered networks of wireless sensors, each sensor collects noisy observations of the environment, quantizes these observations into a local estimate of finite length, and forwards them through one or more noisy wireless channels to the cluster head (CH). The measurement noise is assumed to be zero-mean and have finite variance, and each wireless hop is modeled as a binary symmetric channel (BSC) with a known crossover probability. A novel scheme is proposed that uses dithered quantization and channel compensation to ensure that each sensor's local estimate received by the CH is unbiased. The CH fuses these unbiased local estimates into a global one, using a best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve much smaller mean square error (MSE) than two other common schemes, while using the same amount of energy. The sensitivity of the proposed scheme to errors in estimates of the crossover probability of the BSC channel is studied by both analysis and simulation. We then determine both the minimum energy required for the network to produce an estimate with a prescribed error variance and how this energy must be allocated amongst the sensors in the multihop network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21375","fieldValue":"ACM"}
