Direct sequencing of hypervariable regions from ribosomal RNA genes can provide rapid and inexpensive analysis for ecological communities. In order to get deep understanding from these rRNA fragments, the Ribosomal Database Project developed the 'RDP Classifier' utilizing 8-mer nucleotide frequencies with Bayesian theorem to obtain taxonomy affiliation. The classifier is computationally efficient and works well with massive short sequences. However, the binary model employed in the RDP classifier does not consider the repetitive 8-mers in each reference sequence. Previous studies have pointed out that multinomial model usually results a better performance than binary model. In this study, we present the naÃ¯ve Bayesian classifiers with multinomial models that take repetitive 8-mers into account for classifying microbial 16S and fungal 28S rRNA sequences. The results obtained from the multinomial approach were compared with those obtained from the binomial RDP classifier by 250-bp, 400-bp, 800-bp, and full-length reads to demonstrate that the multinomial approach can generally achieve a higher prediction accuracy in most hypervariable regions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4970","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4970","fieldValue":"Bayes methods,Training,Biological system modeling,Sequential analysis,Computational modeling,Databases,and association rules,Mining methods and algorithms,Clustering,classification"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4970","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4970","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4971","fieldValue":" For clinical applications, the biological functions of DNA-binding proteins require that they interact with their target binding site with high affinity and specificity. Advances in randomized production and target-oriented selection of engineered artificial DNA-binding domains incited a rapidly expanding field of designer transcription factors (TFs). Engineered transcription factors are used in zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) technology that allows targeted genome editing. Zinc-finger-binding domains fabricated by modular assembly display an unexpectedly high failure rate having either a lack of activity as ZFNs in human cells or activity at \"off-targetÃ¢Â\u20ACÂ? binding sites on the human genome causing cell death. To address these shortcomings, we created new binding domains using a targeted modification strategy. We produced two SP1 mutants by exchanging amino acid residues in the alpha-helical region of the transcription factor SP1. We identified their best target binding sites and searched the NCBI HuRef genome for matches of the nine-base-pair consensus binding site of SP1 and the best binding sites of its mutants. Our research concludes that we can alter the binding preference of existing zinc-finger domains without altering its biological functionalities."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4971","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4971","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4971","fieldValue":"ACM"}
