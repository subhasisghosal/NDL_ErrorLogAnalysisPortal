This article presents JCloudScale, a Java-based middleware for moving elastic applications to IaaS clouds, with minimal adjustments to the application code. We discuss the architecture and technical features, as well as evaluate our system with regard to user acceptance and performance overhead. Our user study reveals that JCloudScale allows many participants to build IaaS applications more efficiently, compared to industrial Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions. Additionally, unlike PaaS, JCloudScale does not lead to a control loss and vendor lock-in."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24504","fieldValue":" The domain name system (DNS) includes infrastructures deployed by Internet service providers (ISPs) and third-party suppliers to ensure high responsiveness, resilience, and load sharing. This equipment implies high effort and energy for 24\/7 operation. To facilitate cost reductions in this regard, P-DONAS‚\u20AC\u201Da peer-to-peer (P2P)-based DNS‚\u20AC\u201Dorganizes access nodes (ANs) of an ISP‚\u20ACôs access network, which possess available resources, into a decentralized, self-organizing distributed hash table--based P2P network. Each AN acts as traditional DNS server and solely stores a piece of DNS data. DNS requests issued to an AN are resolved via P2P lookups while maintaining full compatibility with traditional DNS. The article discusses the application of P-DONAS as both a complement and an alternative to traditional DNS. Results from both simulations and a practical test arrangement prove P-DONAS‚\u20ACô high scalability and its performance comparable to that of a commercial DNS name server relieving this name server by 53&percnt; to 75&percnt; of DNS traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24504","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24504","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3377","fieldValue":" The estimation of image quality is a demanding task, especially when estimating different high-quality imaging products or their components. The challenge is the multivariate nature of image quality as well as the need to use na√Øve observers as test subjects, since they are the actual end-users of the products. Here, we use a subjective approach suitable for estimating the quality performance of different imaging device components with na√Øve observers‚\u20AC\u201Dthe interpretation-based quality (IBQ) approach. From two studies with 61 na√Øve observers, 17 natural image contents, and 13 different camera image signal processor pipelines, we determined the subjectively crucial image quality attributes and dimensions and the description of each pipeline's perceived image quality performance. We found that the subjectively most important image quality dimensions were color shift\/naturalness, darkness, and sharpness. The first dimension, which was related to naturalness and colors, distinguished the good-quality pipelines from the middle- and low-quality groups, and the dimensions of darkness and sharpness described why the quality failed in the low-quality pipelines. The study suggests that the high-level concept naturalness is a requirement for high-quality images, whereas quality can fail for other reasons in low-quality images, and this failure can be described by low-level concepts, such as darkness and sharpness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24505","fieldValue":"ACM"}
