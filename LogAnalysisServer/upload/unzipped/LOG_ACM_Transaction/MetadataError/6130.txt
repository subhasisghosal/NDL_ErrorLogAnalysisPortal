Key setup\/sharing is crucial to the protection of such applications\/services from attacks, but existing (public-key, cluster-based, or pairwise) solutions become too expensive (hence, inefficient) when the underlying applications\/services require communications between distant sensor nodes. To remedy this inefficiency, we propose a novel distributed key-sharing scheme, in which each participating sensor node shares unique keys with a small number of other sensor nodesâ\u20AC\u201Dcalled distributed key servers (DKSs)â\u20AC\u201Dchosen according to their geographic distance and communication direction. Using DKSs, we develop two secure routing protocols: (1) secure geographic forwarding that delivers packets by using a chain of DKS lookups, each secured with its own key and forwarded geographically; and (2) key establishment that creates a secure session between two distant sensor nodes based solely on symmetric-ciphers. These protocols enable low-cost, low-power sensors to provide high-level security at a very low cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6359","fieldValue":"Mangione-Smith, William H."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6359","fieldValue":" Most network routers and switches provide some protection against the network attacks. However, the rapidly increasing amount of damages reported over the past few years indicates the urgent need for tougher security. Deep-packet inspection is one of the solutions to capture packets that can not be identified using the traditional methods. It uses a list of signatures to scan the entire content of the packet, providing the means to filter harmful packets out of the network. Since one signature does not depend on the other, the filtering process has a high degree of parallelism. Most software and hardware deep-packet filters that are in use today execute the tasks under Von Neuman architecture. Such architecture can not fully take advantage of the parallelism. For instance, one of the most widely used network intrusion-detection systems, Snort, configured with 845 patterns, running on a dual 1-GHz Pentium III system, can sustain a throughput of only 50 Mbps. The poor performance is because of the fact that the processor is programmed to execute several tasks sequentially instead of simultaneously. We designed scalable deep-packet filters on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to search for all data-independent patterns simultaneously. With FPGAs, we have the ability to reprogram the filter when there are any changes to the signature set. The smallest full-pattern matcher implementation for the latest Snort NIDS fits in a single 400k Xilinx FPGA (Spartan 3-XC3S400) with a sustained throughput of 1.6 Gbps. Given a larger FPGA, the design can scale linearly to support a greater number of patterns, as well as higher data throughput."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6359","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6359","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6360","fieldValue":"Ben-Romdhane, Mohamed"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6360","fieldValue":" Currently, system-on-chip (SoC) designs are becoming increasingly complex, with more and more components being integrated into a single SoC design. Communication between these components is increasingly dominating critical system paths and frequently becomes the source of performance bottlenecks. It, therefore, becomes imperative for designers to explore the communication space early in the design flow. Traditionally, system designers have used Pin-Accurate Bus Cycle Accurate (PA-BCA) models for early communication space exploration. These models capture all of the bus signals and strictly maintain cycle accuracy, which is useful for reliable performance exploration but results in slow simulation speeds for complex, designs, even when they are modeled using high-level languages. Recently, there have been several efforts to use the Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) paradigm for improving simulation performance in BCA models. However, these transaction-based BCA (T-BCA) models capture a lot of details that can be eliminated when exploring communication architectures. In this paper, we extend the TLM approach and propose a new transaction-based modeling abstraction level (CCATB) to explore the communication design space. Our abstraction level bridges the gap between the TLM and BCA levels, and yields an average performance speedup of 120&percent; over PA-BCA and 67&percent; over T-BCA models, on average. The CCATB models are not only faster to simulate, but also extremely accurate and take less time to model compared to both T-BCA and PA-BCA models. We describe the mechanisms that produce the speedup in CCATB models and also analyze how the achieved simulation speedup scales with design complexity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of using CCATB for exploration, we present communication space exploration case studies from the broadband communication and multimedia application domains."}
