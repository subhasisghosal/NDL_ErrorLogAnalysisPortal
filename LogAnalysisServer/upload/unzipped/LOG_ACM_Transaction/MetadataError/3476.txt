This article studies the problem of associating deterministically a track revealed by the sensor network with the trajectory of an unique anonymous object, namely the multiple object tracking and identification (MOTI) problem. In our model, the network is represented by a sparse connected graph where each vertex represents a binary sensor and there is an edge between two sensors if an object can pass from one sensed region to another one without activating any other sensor. The difficulty of MOTI lies in the fact that the trajectories of two or more objects can be so close that the corresponding tracks on the sensor network can no longer be distinguished (track merging), thus confusing the deterministic association between an object trajectory and a track. The article presents several results. We first show that MOTI cannot be solved on a general graph of ideal binary sensors even by an omniscient external observer if all the objects can freely move on the graph. Then we describe restrictions that can be imposed a priori either on the graph, on the object movements, or on both, to make the MOTI problem always solvable. In the absence of an omniscient observer, we show how our results can lead to the definition of distributed algorithms that are able to detect when the system is in a state where MOTI becomes unsolvable."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21368","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21368","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21369","fieldValue":" Recently, distributed data storage has gained increasing popularity for efficient and robust data management in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The distributed architecture makes it challenging to build a highly secure and dependable yet lightweight data storage system. On the one hand, sensor data are subject to not only Byzantine failures, but also dynamic pollution attacks, as along the time the adversary may modify\/pollute the stored data by compromising individual sensors. On the other hand, the resource-constrained nature of WSNs precludes the applicability of heavyweight security designs. To address the challenge, in this article we propose a novel dependable and secure data storage scheme with dynamic integrity assurance. Based on the principle of secret sharing and erasure coding, we first propose a hybrid share generation and distribution scheme to achieve reliable and fault-tolerant initial data storage by providing redundancy for original data components. To further dynamically ensure the integrity of the distributed data shares, we then propose an efficient data integrity verification scheme exploiting the techniques of algebraic signature and spot-checking. The proposed scheme enables individual sensors to verify in one protocol execution the correctness of all the pertaining data shares simultaneously in the absence of the original data. Extensive security analysis shows that the proposed scheme has strong resistance against various data pollution attacks. The efficiency of the scheme is demonstrated by experiments on sensor platforms Tmote Sky and iMote2."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21369","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21369","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21370","fieldValue":" Security services such as data confidentiality, authenticity, and availability are critical in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deployed in adversarial environments. Due to the resource constrain's of sensor nodes, the existing protocols currently in use in adhoc networks cannot be employed in WSNs. In this article, we propose a protocol called location-aware network-coding security (LNCS) that provides all the aforementioned security services. By dividing the terrain into nonoverlapping cells, the nodes take advantage of the location information to derive different location-binding keys. The key idea in LNCS is that all the nodes involved in the protocol collaborate in every phase. We employ random network coding in order to provide data availability significantly higher than that in other schemes. A hash tree-based authentication mechanism is utilized to filter the bogus packets enroute. We provide a comparison between our scheme and previously proposed schemes. The results reveal significant improvement in data availability while maintaining the same level of data confidentiality and authenticity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21370","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21370","fieldValue":"ACM"}
