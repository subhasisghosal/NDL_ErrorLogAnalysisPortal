Events of all types, from flight arrivals to business meetings, are announced on this board. Tracking and reacting to such event announcements, however, is a tedious manual task, only slightly alleviated by email or similar notifications. Announcements are published with human readers in mind, and updates or delayed announcements are frequent. These characteristics have hampered attempts at automatic tracking. PeaCE provides the first integrated framework for event processing on top of web event ads, consisting of event extraction, complex event processing, and action execution in response to these events. Given a schema of the events to be tracked, the framework populates this schema by extracting events from announcement sources. This extraction is performed by little programs called wrappers that produce the events including updates and retractions. PeaCE then queries these events to detect complex events, often combining announcements from multiple sources. To deal with updates and delayed announcements, PeaCEâ\u20AC™s schemas are bitemporal, to distinguish between occurrence and detection time. This allows complex event specifications to track updates and to react upon differences in occurrence and detection time. In case of new, changing, or deleted events, PeaCE allows one to execute actions, such as tweeting or sending out email notifications. Actions are typically specified as web interactions, for example, to fill and submit a form with attributes of the triggering event. Our evaluation shows that PeaCEâ\u20AC™s processing is dominated by the time needed for accessing the web to extract events and perform actions, allotting to 97.4&percnt;. Thus, PeaCE requires only 2.6&percnt; overhead, and therefore, the complex event processor scales well even with moderate resources. We further show that simple and reasonable restrictions on complex event specifications and the timing of constituent events suffice to guarantee that PeaCE only requires a constant buffer to process arbitrarily many event announcements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23344","fieldValue":" Financial institutions in the United States are required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to provide annual privacy notices. In 2009, eight federal agencies jointly released a model privacy form for these disclosures. While the use of this model privacy form is not required, it has been widely adopted. We automatically evaluated 6,191 U.S. financial institutionsâ\u20AC™ privacy notices posted on the World Wide Web. We found large variance in stated practices, even among institutions of the same type. While thousands of financial institutions share personal information without providing the opportunity for consumers to opt out, some institutionsâ\u20AC™ practices are more privacy protective. Regression analyses show that large institutions and those headquartered in the northeastern region share consumersâ\u20AC™ personal information at higher rates than all other institutions. Furthermore, our analysis helped us uncover institutions that do not let consumers limit data sharing when legally required to do so, as well as institutions making self-contradictory statements. We discuss implications for privacy in the financial industry, issues with the design and use of the model privacy form on the World Wide Web, and future directions for standardized privacy notice."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23344","fieldValue":"WWW"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23345","fieldValue":" Community question-answering (CQA) systems, such as Yahoo&excl; Answers or Stack Overflow, belong to a prominent group of successful and popular Web 2.0 applications, which are used every day by millions of users to find an answer on complex, subjective, or context-dependent questions. In order to obtain answers effectively, CQA systems should optimally harness collective intelligence of the whole online community, which will be impossible without appropriate collaboration support provided by information technologies. Therefore, CQA became an interesting and promising subject of research in computer science and now we can gather the results of 10 years of research. Nevertheless, in spite of the increasing number of publications emerging each year, so far the research on CQA systems has missed a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey. We attempt to fill this gap by a review of 265 articles published between 2005 and 2014, which were selected from major conferences and journals. According to this evaluation, at first we propose a framework that defines descriptive attributes of CQA approaches. Second, we introduce a classification of all approaches with respect to problems they are aimed to solve. The classification is consequently employed in a review of a significant number of representative approaches, which are described by means of attributes from the descriptive framework. As a part of the survey, we also depict the current trends as well as highlight the areas that require further attention from the research community."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23345","fieldValue":"ACM"}
