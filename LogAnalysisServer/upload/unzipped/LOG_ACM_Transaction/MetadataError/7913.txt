{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10640","fieldValue":" Linking network flows is an important problem in intrusion detection as well as anonymity. Passive traffic analysis can link flows, but requires long periods of observation to reduce errors. Active traffic analysis, also known as flow watermarking, allows for better precision and is more scalable. Previous flow watermarks introduce significant delays to the traffic flow as a side effect of using a blind detection scheme; this enables attacks that detect and remove the watermark, while at the same time slowing down legitimate traffic. We propose the first non-blind approach for flow watermarking, called RAINBOW, that improves watermark invisibility by inserting delays hundreds of times smaller than previous blind watermarks, hence reduces the watermark interference on network flows. We derive and analyze the optimum detectors for RAINBOW as well as the passive traffic analysis under different traffic models by using hypothesis testing. Comparing the detection performance of RAINBOW and the passive approach, we observe that both RAINBOW and passive traffic analysis perform similarly good in the case of uncorrelated traffic, however the RAINBOW detector drastically outperforms the optimum passive detector in the case of correlated network flows. This justifies the use of non-blind watermarks over passive traffic analysis even though both approaches have similar scalability constraints. We confirm our analysis by simulating the detectors and testing them against large traces of real network flows."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10640","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10640","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10640","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1971","fieldValue":"Dias, Ricardo J"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1971","fieldValue":"Cheriton, David R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1971","fieldValue":" Transactional memory systems providing snapshot isolation enable concurrent access to shared data without incurring aborts on read-write conflicts. Reducing aborts is extremely relevant as it leads to higher concurrency, greater performance, and better predictability. Unfortunately, snapshot isolation does not provide serializability as it allows certain anomalies that can lead to subtle consistency violations. While some mechanisms have been proposed to verify the correctness of a program utilizing snapshot isolation transactions, it remains difficult to repair incorrect applications. To reduce the programmerâ\u20AC™s burden in this case, we present a technique based on dynamic code and graph dependency analysis that automatically corrects existing snapshot isolation anomalies in transactional memory programs. Our evaluation shows that corrected applications retain the performance benefits characteristic of snapshot isolation over conventional transactional memory systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1971","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1971","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10641","fieldValue":" Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) allow unlicensed users to opportunistically access the licensed spectrum without causing disruptive interference to the primary users (PUs). One of the main challenges in CRNs is the ability to detect PU transmissions. Recent works have suggested the use of secondary user (SU) cooperation over individual sensing to improve sensing accuracy. In this paper, we consider a CRN consisting of multiple PUs and SUs to study the problem of maximizing the total expected system throughput. First, we study the sensing decision problem for maximizing the system throughput subject to a constraint on the PU throughput, and we design a Bayesian decision rule-based algorithm. The problem is shown to be strongly NP-hard and solved via a greedy algorithm with time complexity $O(N5\/log^2$ 1\/1-Îµ), where N is the total number of SUs. The algorithm achieves a throughput strictly greater than 1\/2(1-Îµ) of the optimal solution and results in a small constraint violation that goes to zero with Îµ. We then investigate the more general problem with constraints on both PU throughput and the sensing time overhead, which limits the number of SUs that can participate in cooperative sensing. We illustrate the efficacy of the performance of our algorithms and provide sensitivity analysis via a numerical investigation."}
