{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9949","fieldValue":" Throughput optimal scheduling policies in general require the solution of a complex and often NP-hard optimization problem. Related literature has shown that in the context of time-varying channels, randomized scheduling policies can be employed to reduce the complexity of the optimization problem but at the expense of a memory requirement that is exponential in the number of data flows. In this paper, we consider a linear-memory randomized scheduling policy (LM-RSP) that is based on a pick-and-compare principle in a time-varying network with N one-hop data flows. For general ergodic channel processes, we study the performance of LM-RSP in terms of its stability region and average delay. Specifically, we show that LM-RSP can stabilize a fraction of the capacity region. Our analysis characterizes this fraction as well as the average delay as a function of channel variations and the efficiency of LM-RSP in choosing an appropriate schedule vector. Applying these results to a class of Markovian channels, we provide explicit results on the stability region and delay performance of LM-RSP."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9949","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9949","fieldValue":"On stability region and delay performance of linear-memory randomized scheduling for time-varying networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9949","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9949","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9950","fieldValue":" The capacity of ad hoc wireless networks can be substantially increased by equipping each network node with multiple radio interfaces that can operate on multiple nonoverlapping channels. However, new scheduling, channel-assignment, and routing algorithms are required to fully utilize the increased bandwidth in multichannel multiradio ad hoc networks. In this paper, we develop fully distributed algorithms that jointly solve the channel-assignment, scheduling, and routing problem. Our algorithms are online algorithms, i.e., they do not require prior information on the offered load to the network, and can adapt automatically to the changes in the network topology and offered load. We show that our algorithms are provably efficient. That is, even compared with the optimal centralized and offline algorithm, our proposed distributed algorithms can achieve a provable fraction of the maximum system capacity. Furthermore, the achievable fraction that we can guarantee is larger than that of some other comparable algorithms in the literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9950","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9950","fieldValue":"Distributed and provably efficient algorithms for joint channel-assignment, scheduling, and routing in multichannel ad hoc wireless networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9950","fieldValue":"ACM"}
