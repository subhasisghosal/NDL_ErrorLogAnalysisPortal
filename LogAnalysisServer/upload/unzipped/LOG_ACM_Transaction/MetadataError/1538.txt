These surfaces are rendered directly in terms of their polynomial representations, as opposed to a collection of approximating triangles, thereby eliminating tessellation artifacts and reducing memory usage. A key step in such algorithms is the computation of univariate polynomial coefficients at each pixel; real roots of this polynomial correspond to possibly visible points on the surface. Our approach leverages the strengths of GPU computation and is highly efficient. Furthermore, we compute these coefficients in Bernstein form to maximize the stability of root finding, and to provide shader instances with an early exit test based on the sign of these coefficients. Solving for roots is done using analytic techniques that map well to a SIMD architecture, but limits us to fourth order algebraic surfaces. The general framework could be extended to higher order with numerical root finding."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/15670","fieldValue":"B&eacute;zier tetrahedra"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15670","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15670","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15671","fieldValue":" A piecewise smooth surface, possibly with boundaries, sharp edges, corners, or other features is defined by a set of samples. The basic idea is to model surface patches, curve segments and points explicitly, and then to glue them together based on explicit connectivity information. The geometry is defined as the set of stationary points of a projection operator, which is generalized to allow modeling curves with samples, and extended to account for the connectivity information. Additional tangent constraints can be used to model shapes with continuous tangents across edges and corners."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15672","fieldValue":"Yang, Yong-Liang"}
