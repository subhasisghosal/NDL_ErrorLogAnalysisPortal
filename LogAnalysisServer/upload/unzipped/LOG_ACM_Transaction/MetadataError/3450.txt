Increasingly, these devices are being employed as instruments for introspection into habits and situations of individuals and communities. Many of the applications enabled by this new use of mobile phones rely on contextual information. The focus of this work is on one dimension of context, the transportation mode of an individual when outside. We create a convenient (no specific position and orientation setting) classification system that uses a mobile phone with a built-in GPS receiver and an accelerometer. The transportation modes identified include whether an individual is stationary, walking, running, biking, or in motorized transport. The overall classification system consists of a decision tree followed by a first-order discrete Hidden Markov Model and achieves an accuracy level of 93.6&percnt; when tested on a dataset obtained from sixteen individuals."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21302","fieldValue":" Existing mechanisms for querying wireless sensor networks leak client interests to the servers performing the queries. The leaks are not only in terms of specific regions of interest but also of client access patterns. In this article we introduce the problem of preserving the privacy of clients querying a wireless sensor network owned by untrusted organizations. We first propose an efficient protocol, SPYC, that ensures full client privacy in settings where the servers providing access to the network are honest-but-curious and whose collaboration does not extend beyond well-defined administrative purposes. Furthermore, we study the same query privacy problem in a setting where servers exhibit malicious behavior or where powerful external attackers have access to sensor network traffic information. In this setting we propose two metrics for quantifying the privacy achieved by a client's query sequence. We then extend SPYC with a suite of practical algorithms, then analyze the privacy and efficiency levels they provide. Our TOSSIM simulations show that the proposed extensions are communication efficient while significantly improving client privacy levels."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21303","fieldValue":" We present a framework for analyzing the effects of random and selective compromises (using order statistics) in sensor networks. We discuss the problem of ensuring data integrity at the source and during transit in sensor networks, and present an analysis of the reliability of reports from mobile collectors. No analysis has appeared in the literature of source integrity for mobile nodes, or of selective attacks in sensor networks. We address transit data integrity by presenting mGKE, a key establishment scheme for general group-based sensor deployments, and present a detailed analytical and experimental comparison of mGKE with current schemes. mGKE outperforms current methods in terms of resilience, connectivity, and memory and communication overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21303","fieldValue":"ACM"}
