{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12496","fieldValue":" A fertile area of recent research has demonstrated concrete polynomial-time lower bounds for natural hard problems on restricted computational models. Among these problems are Satisfiability, Vertex Cover, Hamilton Path, $MOD_6$-SAT, Majority-of-Majority-SAT, and Tautologies, to name a few. The proofs of these lower bounds follow a proof-by-contradiction strategy that we call resource trading or alternation trading. An important open problem is to determine how powerful such proofs can possibly be. We propose a methodology for studying these proofs that makes them amenable to both formal analysis and automated theorem proving. We prove that the search for better lower bounds can often be turned into a problem of solving a large series of linear programming instances. Implementing a small-scale theorem prover based on these results, we extract new human-readable time lower bounds for several problems and identify patterns that allow for further generalization. The framework can also be used to prove concrete limitations on the current techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12497","fieldValue":" In this work we consider the problem of approximating the number of relevant variables in a function given query access to the function. Since obtaining a multiplicative factor approximation is hard in general, we consider several relaxations of the problem. In particular, we consider a relaxation of the property testing variant of the problem and we consider relaxations in which we have a promise that the function belongs to a certain family of functions (e.g., linear functions). In the former relaxation the task is to distinguish between the case that the number of relevant variables is at most k, and the case in which it is far from any function in which the number of relevant variables is more than (1â\u20AC\u2030+â\u20AC\u2030Î³)k for a parameter Î³. We give both upper bounds and almost matching lower bounds for the relaxations we study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12499","fieldValue":" We present a simple algorithm that approximates the product of n-by-n real matrices A and B.
