Generally, users may be interested in locating, for a topic addressed by a group of similar documents, one or several particular aspects. This kind of task, called instance or aspectual retrieval, has been explored in several TREC Interactive Tracks. In this article, we propose in addition to the classification capacity of clustering techniques, the possibility of offering a indicative extract about the contents of several sources by means of multidocument summarization techniques. Two kinds of summaries are provided. The first one covers the similarities of each cluster of documents retrieved. The second one shows the particularities of each document with respect to the common topic in the cluster. The document multitopic structure has been used in order to determine similarities and differences of topics in the cluster of documents. The system is independent of document domain and genre. An evaluation of the proposed system with users proves significant improvements in effectiveness. The results of previous experiments that have compared clustering algorithms are also reported."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23889","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23889","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3320","fieldValue":" A contact-mechanics analysis was used to explain a tactile illusion engendered by straining the fingertip skin tangentially in a progressive wave pattern resulting in the perception of a moving undulating surface. We derived the strain tensor field induced by a sinusoidal surface sliding on a finger as well as the field created by a tactile transducer array deforming the fingerpad skin by lateral traction. We found that the first field could be well approximated by the second. Our results have several implications. First, tactile displays using lateral skin deformation can generate tactile sensations similar to those using normal skin deformation. Second, a synthesis approach can achieve this result if some constraints on the design of tactile stimulators are met. Third, the mechanoreceptors embedded in the skin must respond to the deviatoric part of the strain tensor field and not to its volumetric part. Finally, many tactile stimuli might represent, for the brain, an inverse problem to be solved, such specific examples of â\u20ACœtactile metameresâ\u20AC? are given."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23890","fieldValue":"Lu, Wen-Hsiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23890","fieldValue":"Chien, Lee-Feng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23890","fieldValue":"Lee, Hsi-Jian"}
