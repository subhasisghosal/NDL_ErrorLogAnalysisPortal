Existing efforts can be categorized into (a) transliteration-based approaches that leverage phonetic similarity and (b) corpus-based approaches that exploit bilingual cooccurrences. These approaches suffer from inaccuracy and scarcity, respectively. In clear contrast, we use under-leveraged resources of monolingual entity cooccurrences crawled from entity search engines, which are represented as two entity-relationship graphs extracted from two language corpora, respectively. Our problem is then abstracted as finding correct mappings across two graphs. To achieve this goal, we propose a holistic approach to exploiting both transliteration similarity and monolingual cooccurrences. This approach, which builds upon monolingual corpora, complements existing corpus-based work requiring scarce resources of parallel or comparable corpus while significantly boosting the accuracy of transliteration-based work. In addition, by parallelizing the mapping process on multicore architectures, we speed up the computation by more than 10 times per unit accuracy. We validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach using real-life datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24067","fieldValue":" The enormous amount of user-generated data available on the Web provides a great opportunity to understand, analyze, and exploit peopleâ\u20AC™s opinions on different topics. Traditional Information Retrieval methods consider the relevance of documents to a topic but are unable to differentiate between subjective and objective documents. Opinion retrieval is a retrieval task in which not only the relevance of a document to the topic is important but also the amount of opinion expressed in the document about the topic. In this article, we address the blog post opinion retrieval task and propose methods that rank blog posts according to their relevance and opinionatedness toward a topic. We propose estimating the opinion density at each position in a document using a general opinion lexicon and kernel density functions. We propose and investigate different models for aggregating the opinion density at query terms positions to estimate the opinion score of every document. We then combine the opinion score with the relevance score based on a probabilistic justification. Experimental results on the BLOG06 dataset show that the proposed method provides significant improvement over the standard TREC baselines. The proposed models also achieve much higher performance compared to all state of the art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3338","fieldValue":" The overarching goal of this research was to compare different rendering solutions in order to understand why some yield better results specifically when applied to rendering synthetic objects into real photographs. A psychophysical experiment was conducted in which the composite images were judged for accuracy against the original photograph. In addition, iCAM, an image color appearance model was also used to calculate image differences for the same set of images. Conclusions obtained included the effect of global illumination on the accuracy of the final composite rendering. Also, it was discovered that the original rendering with all of its artifacts is not necessarily an indicator of the final composite image's judged accuracy. Finally, initial results show promise in using iCAM to predict a relationship similar to the psychophysics, which could eventually be used in-the-rendering-loop to achieve photorealism with minimized computation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3338","fieldValue":"ACM"}
