There is evidence that the presentation of the text has a significant effect on a textâ\u20AC™s accessibility for people with dyslexia. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no experiments that objectively measure the impact of the typeface (font) on screen reading performance. In this article, we present the first experiment that uses eye-tracking to measure the effect of typeface on reading speed. Using a mixed between-within subject design, 97 subjects (48 with dyslexia) read 12 texts with 12 different fonts. Font types have an impact on readability for people with and without dyslexia. For the tested fonts, sans serif, monospaced, and roman font styles significantly improved the reading performance over serif, proportional, and italic fonts. On the basis of our results, we recommend a set of more accessible fonts for people with and without dyslexia."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6194","fieldValue":"Yun, Han-Saem"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6194","fieldValue":" We address the problem of energy-optimal voltage scheduling for fixed-priority hard real-time systems, on which we present a complete treatment both theoretically and practically. Although most practical real-time systems are based on fixed-priority scheduling, there have been few research results known on the energy-optimal fixed-priority scheduling problem. First, we prove that the problem is NP-hard. Then, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the problem. For any &epsiv; > 0, the proposed approximation scheme computes a voltage schedule whose energy consumption is at most (1 + &epsiv;) times that of the optimal voltage schedule. Furthermore, the running time of the proposed approximation scheme is bounded by a polynomial function of the number of input jobs and 1\/&epsiv;. Given the NP-hardness of the problem, the proposed approximation scheme is practically the best solution because it can compute a near-optimal voltage schedule (i.e., provably arbitrarily close to the optimal schedule) in polynomial time. Experimental results show that the approximation scheme finds more efficient (almost optimal) voltage schedules faster than the best existing heuristic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6194","fieldValue":"ACM"}
