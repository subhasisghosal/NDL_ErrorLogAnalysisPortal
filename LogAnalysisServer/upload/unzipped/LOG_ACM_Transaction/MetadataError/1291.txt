In this paper, we show that this approach is overly restrictive and derive the constraints on the associated homogeneous curve that are both necessary and sufficient to ensure that the rational curve is either parametrically, geometrically, or Frenet frame continuous."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15019","fieldValue":" The use of Bernstein polynomials as the basis functions in Bézier's UNISURF is well known. These basis functions possess the shape-preserving properties that are required in designing free form curves and surfaces. These curves and surfaces are computed efficiently using the de Casteljau Algorithm. Ball uses a similar approach in defining cubic curves and bicubic surfaces in his CONSURF program. The basis functions employed are slightly different from the Bernstein polynomials. However, they also possess the same shape-preserving properties. A generalization of these cubic basis functions of Ball, such that higher order curves and surfaces can be defined and a recursive algorithm for generating the generalized curve are presented. The algorithm could be extended to generate a generalized surface in much the same way that the de Casteljau Algorithm could be used to generate a Bézier surface."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15019","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15019","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15020","fieldValue":" An extension of the radiosity method is presented that rigorously accounts for the presence of a small number of specularly reflecting surfaces in an otherwise diffuse scene, and for the presence of a small number of specular or ideal diffuse transmitters. The relationship between the extended method and earlier radiosity and ray-tracing methods is outlined. It is shown that all three methods are based on the same general equation of radiative transfer. A simple superposition of the earlier radiosity and ray-tracing methods in order to account for specular behavior is shown to be physically inconsistent, as the methods are based on different assumptions. Specular behavior is correctly included in the present method. The extended radiosity method and example images are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15020","fieldValue":"ACM"}
