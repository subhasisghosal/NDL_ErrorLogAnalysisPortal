We propose a model which performs this prediction based on the hypothesis that intelligibility is monotonically related to the mutual information between critical-band amplitude envelopes of the clean signal and the corresponding noisy\/processed signal. The resulting intelligibility predictor turns out to be a simple function of the mean-square error (mse) that arises when estimating a clean critical-band amplitude using a minimum mean-square error (mmse) estimator based on the noisy\/processed amplitude. The proposed model predicts that speech intelligibility cannot be improved by any processing of noisy critical-band amplitudes. Furthermore, the proposed intelligibility predictor performs well ( Ï? > 0.95) in predicting the intelligibility of speech signals contaminated by additive noise and potentially non-linearly processed using time-frequency weighting."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1273","fieldValue":"Hallstrom, Jason O"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1273","fieldValue":" Due to the limited computational and energy resources available on existing wireless sensor platforms, achieving high-precision classification of high-level events in-network is a challenge. In this article, we present in-network implementations of a Bayesian classifier and a condensed kd-tree classifier for identifying events of interest on resource-lean embedded sensors. The first approach uses preprocessed sensor readings to derive a multidimensional Bayesian classifier used to classify sensor data in real time. The second introduces an innovative condensed kd-tree to represent preprocessed sensor data and uses a fast nearest-neighbor search to determine the likelihood of class membership for incoming samples. Both classifiers consume limited resources and provide high-precision classification. To evaluate each approach, two case studies are considered, in the contexts of human movement and vehicle navigation, respectively. The classification accuracy is above 85&percnt; for both classifiers across the two case studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1273","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1273","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3620","fieldValue":"Junfeng Li"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3620","fieldValue":" Reverberation is a well known effect that has an important role in our listening experience. A great deal of research has been devoted in the last decades aiming to artificially reproduce the reverberation effect exploiting a hybrid reverberation structure. In this context, several automatic procedures have been presented in the literature in order to derive the reverberator structure considering the mixing time evaluation and the minimization functions definition for the late reverberation device. Taking into consideration these aspects, a deep analysis of hybrid digital reverberator audio quality is here proposed, introducing a new parameter for the definition of the mixing time and two new cost functions for the definition of the late reverberation parameters. More in detail, starting from the considerations derived from a previous accurate approach based on the mel frequency cepstral coefficients, the new cost functions are based on the evaluation of the perceptual linear predictive and power normalized cepstral coefficients. Several results are reported, in terms of objective measure, performance analysis and subjective measures, taking into consideration different real impulse responses and various input stimuli and making a comparison with the state of the art. In particular, the obtained results show that a good accuracy can be achieved also considering a low number of coefficients, therefore improving the computational performance."}
