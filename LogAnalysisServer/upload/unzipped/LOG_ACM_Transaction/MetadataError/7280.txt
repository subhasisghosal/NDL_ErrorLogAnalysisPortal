The algorithm dynamically supports all k-port traffic matrices among N end nodes, where k denotes an integer vector [k1...,kN] and end node i, 1 â\u2030¤ i â\u2030¤ N, can transmit at most ki wavelengths and receive at most ki wavelengths. Our algorithm is rearrangeably nonblocking, uses the minimum number of wavelengths, and requires at most $d^* - 1 lightpath rearrangements per new session request, where d*$ is the degree of the most heavily used node. We observe that the number of lightpath rearrangements per new session request does not increase as the amount of traffic k scales up by an integer factor. In addition, wavelength converters cannot reduce the number of wavelengths required to support k-port traffic in a tree network. We show how to implement our WA algorithm using a hybrid wavelength-routed\/broadcast tree with only one switching node connecting several passive broadcast subtrees. Finally, using roughly twice the minimum number of wavelengths for a rear-rangeably nonblocking WA algorithm, we can modify the WA algorithm to be strict-sense nonblocking."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9377","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9378","fieldValue":"Labourdette, Jean-Franois"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9378","fieldValue":" This paper presents a collection of approximation formulas that allow a network planner to quickly estimate the size of a mesh optical network with limited inputs. In particular, it provides a set of equations that relate number of sites, average fiber connectivity, demand load and capacity for various mesh protection architectures. These results can be used to easily and quickly estimate the amount of traffic that can be carried over a given network, or, conversely, given the traffic to be supported, to assess the characteristics of the topology required (in terms of number of nodes, connectivity). Finally, this analysis can be used to estimate the restoration performance that can be expected without resorting to extensive simulation studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9378","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
