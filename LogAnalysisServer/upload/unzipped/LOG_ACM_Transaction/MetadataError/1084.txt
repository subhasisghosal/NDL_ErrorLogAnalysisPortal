For example, in a database of bank customers, Age and Balance are two numeric attributes, and CardLoan is a Boolean attribute. Taking the pair (Age, Balance) as a point in two-dimensional space, we consider an association rule of the form Age,Balance âˆˆPâ\u2021\u2019CardLoan =Yes, which implies that bank customers whose ages and balances fall within a planar region P tend to take out credit card loans with a high probability.We consider two classes of regions, rectangles and admissible (i.e., connected and x-monotone) regions. For each class, we propose efficient algorithms for computing the regions that give optimal association rules for gain, support, and confidence, respectively. We have implemented the algorithms for admissible regions as well as several advanced functions based on them in our data mining system named SONAR (System for Optimized Numeric Association Rules), where the rules are visualized by using a graphic user interface to make it easy for users to gain an intuitive understanding of rules."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14286","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14286","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14287","fieldValue":" Although several access control policies can be devised for controlling access to information, all existing authorization models, and the corresponding enforcement mechanisms, are based on a specific policy (usually the closed policy). As a consequence, although different policy choices are possible in theory, in practice only a specific policy can actually be applied within a given system. In this paper, we present a unified framework that can enforce multiple access control policies within a single system. The framework is based on a language through which users can specify security policies to be enforced on specific accesses. The language allows the specification of both positive and negative authorizations and incorporates notions of authorization derivation, conflict resolution, and decision strategies. Different strategies may be applied to different users, groups, objects, or roles, based on the needs of the security policy. The overall result is a flexible and powerful, yet simple, framework that can easily capture many of the traditional access control policies as well as protection requirements that exist in real-world applications, but are seldom supported by existing systems. The major advantage of our approach is that it can be used to specify different access control policies that can all coexist in the same system and be enforced by the same security server."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14288","fieldValue":"Editorial"}
