The role of lipid rafts in inducing and promoting receptor accumulation within the cell membrane has been explored by several computational and experimental studies. However, it remains unclear whether lipid rafts influence the recruitment and binding of proteins from the cytosol as well. To provide an answer to this question a spatial membrane model has been developed based on cellular automata. Our results indicate that lipid rafts indeed influence protein receptor bindings. In particular processes with slow dissociation and binding kinetics are promoted by lipid rafts, whereas fast binding processes are slightly hampered. However, the impact depends on a variety of parameters, such as the size and mobility of the lipid rafts, the induced slow down of receptors within rafts, and also the dissociation and binding kinetics of the cytosolic proteins. Thus, for any individual signaling pathway the influence of lipid rafts on protein binding might be different. To facilitate analyzing this influence given a specific pathway, our approach has been generalized into LiRaM, a modeling and simulation tool for lipid rafts models."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4942","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4942","fieldValue":"Modeling and simulation, cellular automata, spatial membrane dynamics, receptor protein binding, lipid rafts"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4942","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4942","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4943","fieldValue":" Based on biological experimental data, we developed a mathematical model of the virus-triggered signaling pathways that lead to induction of type I IFNs and systematically analyzed the mechanisms of the cellular antiviral innate immune responses, including the negative feedback regulation of ISG56 and the positive feedback regulation of IFNs. We found that the time between 5 and 48 hours after viral infection is vital for the control and\/or elimination of the virus from the host cells and demonstrated that the ISG56-induced inhibition of MITA activation is stronger than the ISG56-induced inhibition of TBK1 activation. The global parameter sensitivity analysis suggests that the positive feedback regulation of IFNs is very important in the innate antiviral system. Furthermore, the robustness of the innate immune signaling network was demonstrated using a new robustness index. These results can help us understand the mechanisms of the virus-induced innate immune response at a system level and provide instruction for further biological experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4943","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
