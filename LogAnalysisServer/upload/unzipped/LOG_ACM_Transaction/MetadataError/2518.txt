{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18515","fieldValue":" For a given sparse symmetric positive definite matrix, a compact row-oriented storage scheme for its Cholesky factor is introduced. The scheme is based on the structure of an elimination tree defined for the given matrix. This new storage scheme has the distinct advantage of having the amount of overhead storage required for indexing always bounded by the number of nonzeros in the original matrix. The structural representation may be viewed as storing the minimal structure of the given matrix that will preserve the symbolic Cholesky factor. Experimental results on practical problems indicate that the amount of savings in overhead storage can be substantial when compared with Sherman's compressed column storage scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18516","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18516","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18517","fieldValue":" The procedure CUBGCV is an implementation of a recently developed algorithm for fast O(n) calculation of a cubic smoothing spline fitted to n noisy data points, with the degree of smoothing chosen to minimize the expected mean square error at the data points when the variance of the error associated with the data is known, or, to minimize the generalized cross validation (GCV) when the variance of the error associated with the data is unknown. The data may be unequally spaced and nonuniformly weighted. The algorithm exploits the banded structure of the matrices associated with the cubic smoothing spline problem. Bayesian point error estimates are also calculated in O(n) operations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18517","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18517","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18518","fieldValue":" The computer code for Mehta and Patel's (1983) network algorithm for Fisher's exact test on unordered r√\u2014c contingency tables is provided.
