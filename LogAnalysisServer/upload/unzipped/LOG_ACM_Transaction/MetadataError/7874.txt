This paper proposes a competitive analysis approach to design and reason about online algorithms that find a good tradeoff between the benefits and costs of a migratable service. A competitive online algorithm provides worst-case performance guarantees under any demand dynamics, and without any information or statistical assumptions on the demand in the future. This is attractive especially in scenarios where the demand is hard to predict and can be subject to unexpected events. As a case study, we describe a service (e.g., an SAP server or a gaming application) that uses network virtualization to improve the quality of service (QoS) experienced by thin client applications running on mobile devices. By decoupling the service from the underlying resource infrastructure, it can be migrated closer to the current client locations while taking into account migration costs. We identify the major cost factors in such a system and formalize the wide-area service migration problem. Our main contributions are a randomized and a deterministic online algorithm that achieve a competitive ratio of $O(\\log {n})$ in a simplified scenario, where $n$ is the size of the substrate network. This is almost optimal. We complement our worst-case analysis with simulations in different specific scenarios and also sketch a migration demonstrator."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10562","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10563","fieldValue":" Savings in switching costs of an optical cross-connect can be achieved by grouping together a set of consecutive wavelengths and switching them as a single waveband. This technique is known as waveband switching. While previous work has focused on either uniform band sizes or nonuniform band sizes considering a single node, in this paper we focus on the number of wavebands and their sizes for ring topologies. First, we show that such solutions are inadequate when considering the entire network. We then present a novel framework for optimizing the number of wavebands in a ring network for deterministic traffic. The objective of the Band Minimization Problem is to minimize the number of nonuniform wavebands in the network while using the minimum possible number of wavelengths. We show that the problem is NP-hard and present heuristics for it. We then consider a specific type of traffic, namely all-to-all traffic, and present a construction method for achieving the minimum number of wavebands in the ring. Our results show that the number of ports can be reduced by a large amount using waveband switching compared to wavelength switching, for both all-to-all traffic and random traffic. We also numerically evaluate the performance of our waveband design algorithms under dynamic stochastic traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10563","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10563","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10563","fieldValue":"ACM"}
