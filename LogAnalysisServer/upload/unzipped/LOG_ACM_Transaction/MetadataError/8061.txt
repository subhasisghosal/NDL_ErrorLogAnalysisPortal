In this work, we study such a timing side channel between a regular user and a malicious attacker. Utilizing Shannon's mutual information as a measure of information leakage between the user and attacker, we analyze privacy-preserving behaviors of common work-conserving schedulers. We find that the attacker can always learn perfectly the user's arrival process in a longest-queue-first (LQF) scheduler. When the user's job arrival rate is very low (near zero), first-come - first-serve (FCFS) and round-robin schedulers both completely reveal the user's arrival pattern. The near-complete information leakage in the low-rate traffic region is proven to be reduced by half in a work-conserving version of TDMA (WC-TDMA) scheduler, which turns out to be privacy-optimal in the class of deterministic working-conserving (det-WC) schedulers, according to a universal lower bound on information leakage we derive for all det-WC schedulers."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10933","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10933","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10933","fieldValue":"Quantifying the information leakage in timing side channels in deterministic work-conserving schedulers"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10933","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10933","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10934","fieldValue":" Coping with network failures has become a major networking challenge. The concept of tunable survivability provides a quantitative measure for specifying any desired level (0%--100%) of survivability, thus offering flexibility in the routing choice. Previous works focused on implementing this concept on unicast transmissions. However, vital network information is often broadcast via spanning trees. Accordingly, in this study, we investigate the application of tunable survivability for efficient maintenance of spanning trees under the presence of failures. We establish efficient algorithmic schemes for optimizing the level of survivability under various QoS requirements. In addition, we derive theoretical bounds on the number of required trees for maximum survivability. Finally, through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the tunable survivability concept in the construction of spanning trees. Most notably, we show that, typically, negligible reduction in the level of survivability results in major improvement in the QoS performance of the resulting spanning trees."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10934","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
