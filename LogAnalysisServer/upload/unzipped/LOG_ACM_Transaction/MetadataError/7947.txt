CSMA algorithms incur low complexity and can achieve the optimal capacity under certain assumptions. However, CSMA algorithms suffer the starvation problem and incur large delay that may grow exponentially with the network size. In this paper, our goal is to develop a new algorithm that can provably achieve high throughput utility and low delay with low complexity. Toward this end, we propose a new CSMA-like algorithm, called Virtual-Multi-Channel CSMA (VMC-CSMA), that can dramatically reduce delay. The key idea of VMC-CSMA to avoid the starvation problem is to use multiple virtual channels (which emulate a multichannel system) and compute a good set of feasible schedules simultaneously (without constantly switching\/recomputing schedules). Under the protocol interference model and a single-hop utility-maximization setting, VMC-CSMA can approach arbitrarily close-to-optimal system utility with both the number of virtual channels and the computation complexity increasing logarithmically with the network size. Furthermore, once VMC-CSMA converges to the steady state, we can show that under certain assumptions on the utility functions and the topology, both the expected packet delay and the tail distribution of the head-of-line (HOL) waiting time at each link can be bounded independently of the network size. Our simulation results confirm that VMC-CSMA algorithms indeed achieve both high throughput utility and low delay with low-complexity operations"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10711","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10711","fieldValue":"Achieving optimal throughput utility and low delay with CSMA-like algorithms: a virtual multichannel approach"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10711","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10711","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10712","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose a distributed cross-layer scheduling algorithm for wireless networks with single-hop transmissions that can guarantee finite buffer sizes and meet minimum utility requirements. The algorithm can achieve a utility arbitrarily close to the optimal value with a tradeoff in the buffer sizes. The finite buffer property is not only important from an implementation perspective, but, along with the algorithm, also yields superior delay performance. In addition, another extended algorithm is provided to help construct the upper bounds of per-flow average packet delays. A novel structure of Lyapunov function is employed to prove the utility optimality of the algorithm with the introduction of novel virtual queue structures. Unlike traditional back-pressure-based optimal algorithms, our proposed algorithm does not need centralized computation and achieves fully local implementation without global message passing. Compared to other recent throughput\/utility-optimal CSMA distributed algorithms, we illustrate through rigorous numerical and implementation results that our proposed algorithm achieves far better delay performance for comparable throughput\/utility levels."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10712","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10712","fieldValue":"ACM"}
