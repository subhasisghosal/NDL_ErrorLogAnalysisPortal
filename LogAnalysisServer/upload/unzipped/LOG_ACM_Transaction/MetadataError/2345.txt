{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17711","fieldValue":" The solution of large sparse systems of linear constraints is at the base of most interactive solvers for physically-based animation of soft body dynamics. We focus on applications with hard and tight per-frame resource budgets, such as video games, where the solution of soft body dynamics needs to be computed in a few milliseconds. Linear iterative methods are preferred in these cases since they provide approximate solutions within a given error tolerance and in a short amount of time. We present a parallel randomized Gauss-Seidel method which can be effectively employed to enable the animation of 3D soft objects discretized as large and irregular triangular or tetrahedral meshes. At the beginning of each frame, we partition the set of equations governing the system using a randomized graph coloring algorithm. The unknowns in the equations belonging to the same partition are independent of each other. Then, all the equations belonging to the same partition are solved at the same time in parallel. Our algorithm runs completely on the GPU and can support changes in the constraints topology. We tested our method as a solver for soft body dynamics within the Projective Dynamics and Position Based Dynamics frameworks. We show how the algorithmic simplicity of this iterative strategy enables great numerical stability and fast convergence speed, which are essential features for physically based animations with fixed and small hard time budgets. Compared to the state of the art, we found our method to be faster and scale better while providing stabler solutions for very small time budgets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17711","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17711","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17712","fieldValue":" We present a framework for global parametrization that utilizes the edge lengths (squared) of the mesh as variables. Given a mesh with arbitrary topology and prescribed cone singularities, we flatten the original metric of the surface under strict bounds on the metric distortion (various types of conformal and isometric measures are supported). Our key observation is that the space of bounded distortion metrics (given any particular bounds) is convex, and a broad range of useful and well-known distortion energies are convex as well. With the addition of nonlinear Gaussian curvature constraints, the parametrization problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, and a solution gives a locally injective map. Our method is easy to implement. Sequential convex programming (SCP) is utilized to solve this problem effectively. We demonstrate the flexibility of the method and its uncompromised robustness and compare it to state-of-the-art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17713","fieldValue":"Fu, Xiao-Ming"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17713","fieldValue":" We present a novel method, called Simplex Assembly, to compute inversion-free mappings with low or bounded distortion on simplicial meshes. Our method involves two steps: simplex disassembly and simplex assembly. Given a simplicial mesh and its initial piecewise affine mapping, we project the affine transformation associated with each simplex into the inversion-free and distortion-bounded space. The projection disassembles the input mesh into disjoint simplices. The disjoint simplices are then assembled to recover the original connectivity by minimizing the mapping distortion and the difference of the disjoint vertices with respect to the piecewise affine transformations, while the piecewise affine mapping is restricted inside the feasible space. Due to the use of affine transformations as variables, our method explicitly guarantees that no inverted simplex occurs, and that the mapping distortion is below the bound during the optimization. Compared with existing methods, our method is robust to an initialization with many inverted elements and positional constraints. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method through a variety of geometric processing tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17713","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17713","fieldValue":"ACM"}
