Accurate credit rating information plays a crucial role in supporting sound financial decision-making processes. Most previous studies on credit rating modeling are based on accounting and market information. Text data are largely ignored despite the potential benefit of conveying timely information regarding a firmâ\u20AC™s outlook. To leverage the additional information in news full-text for credit rating prediction, we designed and implemented a news full-text analysis system that provides firm-level coverage, topic, and sentiment variables. The novel topic-specific sentiment variables contain a large fraction of missing values because of uneven news coverage. The missing value problem creates a new challenge for credit rating prediction approaches. We address this issue by developing a missing-tolerant multinomial probit (MT-MNP) model, which imputes missing values based on the Bayesian theoretical framework. Our experiments using seven and a half years of real-world credit ratings and news full-text data show that (1) the overall news coverage can explain future credit rating changes while the aggregated news sentiment cannot; (2) topic-specific news coverage and sentiment have statistically significant impact on future credit rating changes; (3) topic-specific negative sentiment has a more salient impact on future credit rating changes compared to topic-specific positive sentiment; (4) MT-MNP performs better in predicting future credit rating changes compared to support vector machines (SVM). The performance gap as measured by macroaveraging F-measure is small but consistent."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8175","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8175","fieldValue":"SVM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8175","fieldValue":"ACM"}
