In addition to the destinations, there are several other nodes in the network that can assist in relaying the message. We first assume that, at every instant, all the nodes know the number of relays carrying the message and the number of destinations that have received the message. We formulate the problem as a controlled continuous-time Markov chain and derive the optimal closed-loop control (i.e., forwarding policy). However, in practice, the intermittent connectivity in the network implies that the nodes may not have the required perfect knowledge of the system state. To address this issue, we obtain an ordinary differential equation (ODE) (i.e., a deterministic fluid) approximation for the optimally controlled Markov chain. This fluid approximation also yields an asymptotically optimal open-loop policy. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the deterministic policy over finite networks. Numerical results show that this policy performs close to the optimal closed-loop policy."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10535","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10536","fieldValue":" This paper studies the allocation of feedback resources in the downlink of a frequency-division duplex (FDD) multichannel wireless system. We consider a downlink network with a single base station, L shared channels, and N mobile users. Throughput optimal algorithms like MaxWeight in general require the complete channel-state information (CSI) (N L link states) for scheduling. Acquiring the complete CSI, however, is a prohibitive overhead in multichannel networks when the number of users is large. In this paper, we consider the scenario where the base station allocates only a limited amount of uplink resources for acquiring channel-state information. We first show that to support a (1-ε) fraction of the full throughput region (the throughput region with the complete CSI), the base station needs to acquire at least Θ ((1-ε)L) link states at each time-slot. We then propose a Weight-Based Feedback allocation, named WBF, and show that WBF together with MaxWeight scheduling achieves a (1-ε) fraction of the full throughput region by acquiring Θ(L log 1\/ε) link states per time-slot. For i.i.d. ON-OFF channels, we further prove that Θ(L log 1\/ε) link states per time-slot is necessary for achieving a (1-ε) fraction of the full throughput region."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10536","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10536","fieldValue":"ACM"}
