The package uses Chebyshev expansions as the underlying method of approximation, with the Chebyshev coefficients given to 20D. A wide variety of functions are included, and the package is designed so that other functions can be added in a standard manner."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18856","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18856","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18857","fieldValue":" This article deals with an adaptive-grid finite-difference solver for time-dependent two-dimensional systems of partial differential equations. It describes the ANSI Fortran 77 code, VLUGR2, autovectorizable on the Cray Y-MP, that is based on this method. The robustness and the efficiency of the solver, both for vector and scalar processors, are illustrated by the application of the code to two example problems arising from a groundwater-flow model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18857","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18857","fieldValue":"ACM"}
