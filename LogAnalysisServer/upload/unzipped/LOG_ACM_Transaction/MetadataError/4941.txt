Such algorithms are inspired by the foraging behavior of ants in nature. We consider an ARA algorithm proposed earlier by Bean and Costa [2005]. The algorithm has the virtues of being adaptive and distributed, and can provide a multipath routing solution. We consider a scenario where there are multiple incoming data traffic streams that are to be routed to their respective destinations via the network. Ant packets, which are nothing but probe packets, are introduced to estimate the path delays in the network. The node routing tables, which consist of routing probabilities for the outgoing links, are updated based on these delay estimates. In contrast to the available analytical studies in the literature, the link delays in our model are stochastic, time-varying, and dependent on the link traffic. The evolution of the delay estimates and the routing probabilities are described by a set of stochastic iterative equations. In doing so, we take into account the distributed and asynchronous nature of the algorithm operation. Using methods from the theory of stochastic approximations, we show that the evolution of the delay estimates can be closely tracked by a deterministic ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) system, when the step size of the delay estimation scheme is small. We study the equilibrium behavior of the ODE system in order to obtain the equilibrium behavior of the routing algorithm. We also explore properties of the equilibrium routing probabilities, and provide illustrative simulation results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/1265","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2451248.2451251\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3506","fieldValue":" It is common in infographics for quantities to be represented by stacks of discrete blocks. For example, a magazine illustration showing automobile production in different countries might use stacks of blocks with each block representing a thousand cars. This is unlike what is done to represent quantity in the charts used by statisticians, or for quantitative glyphs used in maps. In these cases, solid bars or solid area glyphs such as circles are commonly used to represent quantity. This raises the question of whether breaking bars, area, or volume glyphs into discrete blocks can improve the rapid estimation of quantity. We report on a study where participants compared quantities represented using bar, area, and volume glyphs in both solid and discrete variants. The discrete variants used up to 4, 4 Ã\u2014 4, and 4 Ã\u2014 4 Ã\u2014 4 blocks or 10, 10 Ã\u2014 10, and 10 Ã\u2014 10 Ã\u2014 10 blocks for bar, area, and volume, respectively. The results show that people are significantly more accurate in estimating quantities using the discrete versions, but they take somewhat longer. For both areas and volumes, the accuracy gains were considerable."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3507","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3507","fieldValue":"ACM"}
