An interesting approach, presented in 2011 by Lin et al., results in very high quality of the watermarked images. However, after a thorough examination of the paper, a few improvements are proposed in our revised version of the algorithm in order to overcome some shortcomings. In particular, changes to the pseudocode and modifications to deal with pixel saturation are suggested, along with a way to improve the scheme security. Finally, a deeper analysis of the security is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25627","fieldValue":" Audio signal is sometimes stored and\/or processed in WAV (waveform) format without any knowledge of its previous compression operations. To perform some subsequent processing, such as digital audio forensics, audio enhancement and blind audio quality assessment, it is necessary to identify its compression history. In this article, we will investigate how to identify a decompressed wave audio that went through one of three popular compression schemes, including MP3, WMA (windows media audio) and AAC (advanced audio coding). By analyzing the corresponding frequency coefficients, including modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), of those original audio clips and their decompressed versions with different compression schemes and bit rates, we propose several statistics to identify the compression scheme as well as the corresponding bit rate previously used for a given WAV signal. The experimental results evaluated on 8,800 audio clips with various contents have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, some potential applications of the proposed method are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25627","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25627","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25628","fieldValue":" With the massive growth of events on the Internet, efficient organization and monitoring of events becomes a practical challenge. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel CO-PMHT (CO-Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracking) algorithm for cross-domain multi-event tracking to obtain their informative summary details and evolutionary trends over time. We collect a large-scale dataset by searching keywords on two domains (Gooogle News and Flickr) and downloading both images and textual content for an event. Given the input data, our algorithm can track multiple events in the two domains collaboratively and boost the tracking performance. Specifically, the bridge between two domains is a semantic posterior probability, that avoids the domain gap. After tracking, we can visualize the whole evolutionary process of the event over time and mine the semantic topics of each event for deep understanding and event prediction. The extensive experimental evaluations on the collected dataset well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for cross-domain multi-event tracking."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25628","fieldValue":"CO-PMHT"}
