{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19099","fieldValue":" BHESS uses Gaussian similarity transformations to reduce a general real square matrix to similar upper Hessenberg form. Multipliers are bounded in root mean square by a user-supplied parameter. If the input matrix is not highly nonnormal and the user-supplied tolerance on multipliers is of a size greater than ten, the returned matrix usually has small upper bandwidth. In such a case, eigenvalues of the returned matrix can be determined by the bulge-chasing BR iteration or by Rayleigh quotient iteration. BHESS followed by BR iteration determines a complete spectrum in about one-fifth the time required for orthogonal reduction to Hessenberg form followed by QR iterations. The FORTRAN 77 code provided for BHESS runs efficiently on a cache-based architecture."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19100","fieldValue":" We present the implementation of well-conditioned hierarchical bases for one-dimensional, triangular and tetrahedral elements in finite element FEMLAB software. Using the domain mesh information provided by FEMLAB, we found an easy way to maintain the continuity of solution across the interelement boundaries. The conditionings of the global stiffness matrices of several standard problems are compared with the Lagrange bases and are smaller for all cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19100","fieldValue":"FEMLAB"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19100","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19100","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19101","fieldValue":" We consider the efficient implementation of the Cholesky solution of symmetric positive-definite dense linear systems of equations using packed storage. We take the same starting point as that of LINPACK and LAPACK, with the upper (or lower) triangular part of the matrix stored by columns. Following LINPACK and LAPACK, we overwrite the given matrix by its Cholesky factor. We consider the use of a hybrid format in which blocks of the matrices are held contiguously and compare this to the present LAPACK code. Code based on this format has the storage advantages of the present code but substantially outperforms it. Furthermore, it compares favorably to using conventional full format (LAPACK) and using the recursive format of Andersen et al.
