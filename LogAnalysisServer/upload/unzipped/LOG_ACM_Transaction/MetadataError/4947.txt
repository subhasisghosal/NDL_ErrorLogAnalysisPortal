To be successful and effective, these characters must display a wide range of personalities. Designers and animators create characters with appropriate personalities by using their intuition and artistic expertise. Our goal is to provide evidence-based principles for creating social characters. In this article, we describe the results of two experiments that show how exaggerated and damped facial motion magnitude influence impressions of cartoon and more realistic animated characters. In our first experiment, participants watched animated characters that varied in rendering style and facial motion magnitude. The participants then rated the different animated characters on extroversion, warmth, and competence, which are social traits that are relevant for characters used in entertainment, therapy, and education. We found that facial motion magnitude affected these social traits in cartoon and realistic characters differently. Facial motion magnitude affected ratings of cartoon charactersâ\u20AC™ extroversion and competence more than their warmth. In contrast, facial motion magnitude affected ratings of realistic charactersâ\u20AC™ extroversion but not their competence nor warmth. We ran a second experiment to extend the results of the first. In the second experiment, we added emotional valence as a variable. We also asked participants to rate the characters on more specific aspects of warmth, such as respectfulness, calmness, and attentiveness. Although the charactersâ\u20AC™ emotional valence did not affect ratings, we found that facial motion magnitude influenced ratings of the charactersâ\u20AC™ respectfulness and calmness but not attentiveness. These findings provide a basis for how animators can fine-tune facial motion to control perceptions of animated charactersâ\u20AC™ personalities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3521","fieldValue":"Tree, Jean E Fox"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3521","fieldValue":" Designing virtual characters that are capable of conveying a sense of personality is important for generating realistic experiences, and thus a key goal in computer animation research. Though the influence of gesture and body motion on personality perception has been studied, little is known about which attributes of hand pose and motion convey particular personality traits. Using the â\u20ACœBig Fiveâ\u20AC? model as a framework for evaluating personality traits, this work examines how variations in hand pose and motion impact the perception of a character's personality. As has been done with facial motion, we first study hand motion in isolation as a requirement for running controlled experiments that avoid the combinatorial explosion of multimodal communication (all combinations of facial expressions, arm movements, body movements, and hands) and allow us to understand the communicative content of hands. We determined a set of features likely to reflect personality, based on research in psychology and previous human motion perception work: shape, direction, amplitude, speed, and manipulation. Then we captured realistic hand motion varying these attributes and conducted three perceptual experiments to determine the contribution of these attributes to the character's personalities. Both hand poses and the amplitude of hand motion affected the perception of all five personality traits. Speed impacted all traits except openness. Direction impacted extraversion and openness. Manipulation was perceived as an indicator of introversion, disagreeableness, neuroticism, and less openness to experience. From these results, we generalize guidelines for designing detailed hand motion that can add to the expressiveness and personality of characters. We performed an evaluation study that combined hand motion with gesture and body motion. Even in the presence of body motion, hand motion still significantly impacted the perception of a character's personality and could even be the dominant factor in certain situations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3522","fieldValue":" Light projection is a powerful technique that can be used to edit the appearance of objects in the real world. Based on pixel-wise modification of light transport, previous techniques have successfully modified static surface properties such as surface color, dynamic range, gloss, and shading. Here, we propose an alternative light projection technique that adds a variety of illusory yet realistic distortions to a wide range of static 2D and 3D projection targets. The key idea of our technique, referred to as (Deformation Lamps), is to project only dynamic luminance information, which effectively activates the motion (and shape) processing in the visual system while preserving the color and texture of the original object. Although the projected dynamic luminance information is spatially inconsistent with the color and texture of the target object, the observer's brain automatically combines these sensory signals in such a way as to correct the inconsistency across visual attributes. We conducted a psychophysical experiment to investigate the characteristics of the inconsistency correction and found that the correction was critically dependent on the retinal magnitude of the inconsistency. Another experiment showed that the perceived magnitude of image deformation produced by our techniques was underestimated. The results ruled out the possibility that the effect obtained by our technique stemmed simply from the physical change in an object's appearance by light projection. Finally, we discuss how our techniques can make the observers perceive a vivid and natural movement, deformation, or oscillation of a variety of static objects, including drawn pictures, printed photographs, sculptures with 3D shading, and objects with natural textures including human bodies."}
