{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3095","fieldValue":" The efficiency of any character recognition technique is directly dependent on the accuracy of the generated feature set that could uniquely represent a character and hence correctly recognize it. This article proposes a hybrid approach combining the structural features of the character and a mathematical model of curve fitting to simulate the best features of a character. As a preprocessing step, skeletonization of the character is performed using an iterative thinning algorithm based on Raster scan of the character image. Then, a combination of structural features of the character like number of endpoints, loops, and intersection points is calculated. Further, the thinned character image is statistically zoned into partitions, and a quadratic curve-fitting model is applied on each partition forming a feature vector of the coefficients of the optimally fitted curve. This vector is combined with the spatial distribution of the foreground pixels for each zone and hence script-independent feature representation. The approach has been evaluated experimentally on Devanagari scripts. The algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 93.4&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3095","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3095","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21681","fieldValue":"Issue 1(Special Section on the 2014 International Symposium on Applied Reconfigurable Computing), November 2015"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21915","fieldValue":"Cardoso, Joo M P"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21915","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21915","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21916","fieldValue":" It is common for large hardware designs to have a number of registers or memories whose contents have to be changed very seldom (e.g., only at startup). The conventional way of accessing these memories is through a low-speed memory bus. This bus uses valuable hardware resources, introduces long global connections, and contributes to routing congestion. Hence, it has an impact on the overall design even though it is only rarely used. A Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) already contains a global communication mechanism in the form of its configuration infrastructure. In this article, we evaluate the use of the configuration infrastructure as a replacement for a low-speed memory bus on the Maxeler HPC platform. We find that by removing the conventional low-speed memory bus, the maximum clock frequency of some applications can be improved by 8&percnt;. Improvements by 25&percnt; and more are also attainable, but constraints of the Xilinx reconfiguration infrastructure prevent fully exploiting these benefits at the moment. We present a number of possible changes to the Xilinx reconfiguration infrastructure and tools that would solve this and make these results more widely applicable."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21916","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21916","fieldValue":"HPC"}
