{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4940","fieldValue":" MicroRNAs are very recently discovered small noncoding RNAs, responsible for negative regulation of gene expression. Members of this endogenous family of small RNA molecules have been found implicated in many genetic disorders. Each microRNA targets tens to hundreds of genes. Experimental validation of target genes is a time- and cost-intensive procedure. Therefore, prediction of microRNA targets is a very important problem in computational biology. Though, dozens of target prediction algorithms have been reported in the past decade, they disagree significantly in terms of target gene ranking (based on predicted scores). Rank aggregation is often used to combine multiple target orderings suggested by different algorithms. This technique has been used in diverse fields including social choice theory, meta search in web, and most recently, in bioinformatics. Kemeny optimal aggregation (KOA) is considered the more profound objective for rank aggregation. The consensus ordering obtained through Kemeny optimal aggregation incurs minimum pairwise disagreement with the input orderings. Because of its computational intractability, heuristics are often formulated to obtain a near optimal consensus ranking. Unlike its real time use in meta search, there are a number of scenarios in bioinformatics (e.g., combining microRNA target rankings, combining disease-related gene rankings obtained from microarray experiments) where evolutionary approaches can be afforded with the ambition of better optimization. We conjecture that an ideal consensus ordering should have its total disagreement shared, as equally as possible, with the input orderings. This is also important to refrain the evolutionary processes from getting stuck to local extremes. In the current work, we reformulate Kemeny optimal aggregation while introducing a trade-off between the total pairwise disagreement and its distribution. A simulated annealing-based implementation of the proposed objective has been found effective in context of microRNA target ranking.

It is difficult to use existing computational method to predict miRNA-binding residues in proteins due to the lack of training examples. To address this issue, unlabeled data may be exploited to help construct a computational model. Semisupervised learning deals with methods for exploiting unlabeled data in addition to labeled data automatically to improve learning performance, where no human intervention is assumed. In addition, miRNA-binding proteins almost always contain a much smaller number of binding than nonbinding residues, and cost-sensitive learning has been deemed as a good solution to the class imbalance problem. In this work, a novel model is proposed for recognizing miRNA-binding residues in proteins from sequences using a cost-sensitive extension of Laplacian support vector machines (CS-LapSVM) with a hybrid feature. The hybrid feature consists of evolutionary information of the amino acid sequence (position-specific scoring matrices), the conservation information about three biochemical properties (HKM) and mutual interaction propensities in protein-miRNA complex structures. The CS-LapSVM receives good performance with an F1 score of $(26.23 \\pm 2.55\\%)$ and an AUC value of $(0.805 \\pm 0.020)$ superior to existing approaches for the recognition of RNA-binding residues.
