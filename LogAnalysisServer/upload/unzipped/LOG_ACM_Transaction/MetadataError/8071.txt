In this article, we examine how granularityâ\u20AC\u201Dpage-level versus cache-line levelâ\u20AC\u201Dand adaptivityâ\u20AC\u201Dgoing from shared to privateâ\u20AC\u201Daffect the outcome of classification and its final impact on coherence. We create a classification technique, called Generational Classification, and a coherence protocol called Generational Coherence, which treats data as private or shared based on cache-line generations. We compare two coherence protocols based on self-invalidation\/self-downgrade with respect to data classification. Our findings are enlightening: (i) Some programs benefit from finer granularity, some benefit further from adaptivity, but some do not benefit from either. (ii) Reducing the amount of shared data has no perceptible impact on coherence misses caused by self-invalidation of shared data, hence no impact on performance. (iii) In contrast, classifying more data as private has implications for protocols that employ write-through as a means of self-downgrade, resulting in network traffic reductionâ\u20AC\u201Dup to 30&percnt;â\u20AC\u201Dby reducing write-through traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10950","fieldValue":" The applicability of analog network coding (ANC) to a wireless network is constrained by several limitations: 1) some ANC schemes demand fine-grained frame-level synchronization, which cannot be practically achieved in a wireless network; 2) others support only a specific type of modulation or require equal frame size in concurrent transmissions. In this paper, a new ANC scheme, called restriction-free analog network coding (RANC), is developed to eliminate the above limitations. It incorporates several function blocks, including frame boundary detection, joint channel estimation, waveform recovery, circular channel estimation, and frequency offset estimation, to support random concurrent transmissions with arbitrary frame sizes in a wireless network with various linear modulation schemes. To demonstrate the distinguished features of RANC, two network applications are studied. In the first application, RANC is applied to support a new relaying scheme called multi-way relaying, which significantly improves the spectrum efficiency as compared to two-way relaying. In the second application, RANC enables random-access-based ANC in an ad hoc network where flow compensation can be gracefully exploited to further improve the throughput performance. RANC and its network applications are implemented and evaluated on universal software radio peripheral (USRP) software radio platforms. Extensive experiments confirm that all function blocks of RANC work effectively without being constrained by the above limitations. The overall performance of RANC is shown to approach the ideal case of interference-free communications. The results of experiments in a real network setup demonstrate that RANC significantly outperforms existing ANC schemes and achieves constraint-free ANC in wireless networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10950","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10950","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10950","fieldValue":"ACM"}
