By combining these two types of data, we propose a novel Graph Fragmentation Algorithm (GFA) for protein complex identification. Adapted from a classical max-flow algorithm for finding the (weighted) densest subgraphs, GFA first finds large (weighted) dense subgraphs in a protein-protein interaction network, and then, breaks each such subgraph into fragments iteratively by weighting its nodes appropriately in terms of their corresponding log-fold changes in the microarray data, until the fragment subgraphs are sufficiently small. Our tests on three widely used protein-protein interaction data sets and comparisons with several latest methods for protein complex identification demonstrate the strong performance of our method in predicting novel protein complexes in terms of its specificity and efficiency. Given the high specificity (or precision) that our method has achieved, we conjecture that our prediction results imply more than 200 novel protein complexes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4618","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4618","fieldValue":"Protein complex, protein-protein interaction network, microarray, dense subgraph, maximum network flow, efficient algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4618","fieldValue":"A Max-Flow-Based Approach to the Identification of Protein Complexes Using Protein Interaction and Microarray Data"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1358","fieldValue":"Yen, Li-Hsing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1358","fieldValue":"Huang, Jean-Yao"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1358","fieldValue":" Self-stabilizing systems tolerate transient faults by always returning to a legitimate system state within a finite time. This goal is challenged by several system features such as arbitrary system states after faults, various process execution models, and constrained process communication means. This work designs self-stabilizing distributed algorithms from the perspective of game theory, achieving an intended system goal through private goals of processes. We propose a generic game design for identifying a maximal independent set (MIS) or a maximal weighted independent set (MWIS) among all processes in a distributed system. From the generic game several specific games can be defined which differ in whether and how neighboring players influence each other. Turning the game designs into self-stabilizing algorithms, we obtain the first algorithms for the MWIS problem and also the first self-stabilizing MIS algorithm that considers node degree (including an analysis of its performance ratio). We also show how to handle simultaneous moves of processes in some process execution models. Simulation results indicate that, for various representative network topologies, the new algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of MIS size and convergence rate. For the MWIS problem, the new algorithms performed only slightly worse than centralized greedy counterparts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1358","fieldValue":"ACM"}
