We propose a very accurate strategy to overcome this challenge. Its core concept is the conversion of the model into the format of biochemical systems theory (BST), which greatly facilitates the computation of sensitivities. First, the steady state of interest is determined by integrating the model equations toward the steady state and then using a Newton-Raphson method to fine-tune the result. The second step of conversion into the BST format requires several instances of numerical differentiation. The accuracy of this task is ensured by the use of a complex-variable Taylor scheme for all differentiation steps. The proposed strategy is implemented in a new software program, COSMOS, which automates the stability and sensitivity analysis of essentially arbitrary ODE models in a quick, yet highly accurate manner. The methods underlying the process are theoretically analyzed and illustrated with four representative examples: a simple metabolic reaction model; a model of aspartate-derived amino acid biosynthesis; a TCA-cycle model; and a modified TCA-cycle model.

Multi-task learning (MTL) provides a framework for dealing with such interrelated learning tasks. When two different hierarchical sources organize similar information, in principle, this combined knowledge can be exploited to further improve classification performance. We have studied this problem in the context of protein structure classification by integrating the learning process for two hierarchical protein structure classification database, SCOP and CATH. Our goal is to accurately predict whether a given protein belongs to a particular class in these hierarchies using only the amino acid sequences. We have utilized the recent developments in multi-task learning to solve the interrelated classification problems. We have also evaluated how the various relationships between tasks affect the classification performance. Our evaluations show that learning schemes in which both the classification databases are used outperform the schemes which utilize only one of them."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5115","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
