Using multiclass cancer feature selection approaches, it is now possible to identify genes relevant to a set of cancer types. However, besides identifying the relevant genes for the set of all cancer types, it is deemed to be more informative to biologists if the relevance of each gene to specific cancer or subset of cancer types could be revealed or pinpointed. In this paper, we introduce two new definitions of multiclass relevancy features, i.e., full class relevant (FCR) and partial class relevant (PCR) features. Particularly, FCR denotes genes that serve as candidate biomarkers for discriminating all cancer types. PCR, on the other hand, are genes that distinguish subsets of cancer types. Subsequently, a Markov blanket embedded memetic algorithm is proposed for the simultaneous identification of both FCR and PCR genes. Results obtained on commonly used synthetic and real-world microarray data sets show that the proposed approach converges to valid FCR and PCR genes that would assist biologists in their research work. The identification of both FCR and PCR genes is found to generate improvement in classification accuracy on many microarray data sets. Further comparison study to existing state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms also reveals the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4488","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4488","fieldValue":"Bioinformatics, microarray, multiclass cancer classification, feature\/gene selection, memetic algorithm, Markov blanket."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4488","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4488","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4489","fieldValue":" Models of regulatory networks become more difficult to construct and understand as they grow in size and complexity. Large models are usually built up from smaller models, representing subsets of reactions within the larger network. To assist modelers in this composition process, we present a formal approach for model composition, a wizard-style program for implementing the approach, and suggested language extensions to the Systems Biology Markup Language to support model composition. To illustrate the features of our approach and how to use the JigCell Composition Wizard, we build up a model of the eukaryotic cell cycle \"engineâ\u20AC? from smaller pieces."}
