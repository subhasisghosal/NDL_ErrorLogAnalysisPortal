We show that provability in the multiplicative exponential fragment is Tower-hard already in the affine caseâ\u20AC\u201Dand hence non-elementary. We match this lower bound for the full propositional affine linear logic, proving its Tower-completeness. We also show that provability in propositional contractive linear logic is Ackermann-complete."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11749","fieldValue":" Given two structures G and H distinguishable in $FO^k (first-order logic with k variables), let Ak(G, H) denote the minimum alternation depth of a FOk formula distinguishing G from H. Let Ak(n) be the maximum value of Ak(G, H) over n-element structures. We prove the strictness of the quantifier alternation hierarchy of FO2 in a strong quantitative form, namely A2(n) > n&sol;8 âˆ\u2019 2, which is tight up to a constant factor. For each k &ges; 2, it holds that Ak(n) > $logâ\u20AC\u2030_k &plus; 1n âˆ\u2019 2 even over colored trees, which is also tight up to a constant factor if k &ges; 3. For k &ges; 3, the last lower bound holds also over uncolored trees, whereas the alternation hierarchy of FO2 collapses even over all uncolored graphs. We also show examples of colored graphs G and H on n vertices that can be distinguished in FO2 much more succinctly if the alternation number is increased just by one: Whereas in Î£i it is possible to distinguish G from H with bounded quantifier depth, in Î i$ this requires quantifier depth Î©(n2). The quadratic lower bound is best possible here because, if G and H can be distinguished in FOk with i quantifier alternations, this can be done with quantifier depth n2k âˆ\u2019 2$ &plus; 1 and the same number of alternations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11749","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11749","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11750","fieldValue":" Probabilistic abstract argumentation combines Dungâ\u20AC™s abstract argumentation framework with probability theory in order to model uncertainty in argumentation. In this setting, we address the fundamental problem of computing the probability that a set of arguments is an extension according to a given semantics. We focus on the most popular semantics (i.e., admissible, stable, complete, grounded, preferred, ideal-set, ideal, stage, and semistable) and show the following dichotomy result: computing the probability that a set of arguments is an extension is either FP or $FP^#P$-complete depending on the semantics adopted. Our polynomial-time results are particularly interesting, as they hold for some semantics for which no polynomial-time technique was known so far."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11750","fieldValue":"ACM"}
