Current RGB-based graphics renderers are not sufficient to simulate such phenomena. This is because biological iridescences are caused by interference or diffraction, which requires wavelength information to describe. In this article, we propose an iridescent shading process that allows to render biological iridescences with RGB-based renderers. The key ideas are to construct spectra from colors and to use a wavelength-dependent model to describe iridescences. A novel model for iridescent illumination due to multilayer interference is developed based on analytic calculation and numerical simulation, and is simplified for practical rendering. The iridescent shading process is implemented using RenderMan embedded in Maya. Iridescent Morpho butterflies and ground beetles are rendered as examples to test the proposed techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15634","fieldValue":"RGB"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15634","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15634","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15635","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15635","fieldValue":" This article introduces a method for partial matching of surfaces represented by triangular meshes. Our method matches surface regions that are numerically and topologically dissimilar, but approximately similar regions. We introduce novel local surface descriptors which efficiently represent the geometry of local regions of the surface. The descriptors are defined independently of the underlying triangulation, and form a compatible representation that allows matching of surfaces with different triangulations. To cope with the combinatorial complexity of partial matching of large meshes, we introduce the abstraction of salient geometric features and present a method to construct them. A salient geometric feature is a compound high-level feature of nontrivial local shapes. We show that a relatively small number of such salient geometric features characterizes the surface well for various similarity applications. Matching salient geometric features is based on indexing rotation-invariant features and a voting scheme accelerated by geometric hashing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a number of applications, such as computing self-similarity, alignments, and subparts similarity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15635","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15635","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15636","fieldValue":" This article introduces the Hierarchical Run-Length Encoded (H-RLE) Level Set data structure. This novel data structure combines the best features of the DT-Grid (of Nielsen and Museth [2004]) and the RLE Sparse Level Set (of Houston et al. [2004]) to provide both optimal efficiency and extreme versatility. In brief, the H-RLE level set employs an RLE in a dimensionally recursive fashion. The RLE scheme allows the compact storage of sequential nonnarrowband regions while the dimensionally recursive encoding along each axis efficiently compacts nonnarrowband planes and volumes. Consequently, this new structure can store and process level sets with effective voxel resolutions exceeding 5000 Ã\u2014 3000 Ã\u2014 3000 (45 billion voxels) on commodity PCs with only 1 GB of memory. This article, besides introducing the H-RLE level set data structure and its efficient core algorithms, also describes numerous applications that have benefited from our use of this structure: our unified implicit object representation, efficient and robust mesh to level set conversion, rapid ray tracing, level set metamorphosis, collision detection, and fully sparse fluid simulation (including RLE vector and matrix representations.) Our comparisons of the popular octree level set and Peng level set structures to the H-RLE level set indicate that the latter is superior in both narrowband sequential access speed and overall memory usage."}
