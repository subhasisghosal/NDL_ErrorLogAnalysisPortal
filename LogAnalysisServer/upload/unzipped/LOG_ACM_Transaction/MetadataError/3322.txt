It promises high performance, high storage density, and low power consumption. With fundamentally different architectural designs from magnetic disk, MEMS-based storage exhibits unique two-dimensional positioning behaviors and efficient power state transitions. We model these low-level, device-specific properties of MEMS-based storage and present request scheduling algorithms and power management strategies that exploit the full potential of these devices. Our simulations show that MEMS-specific device management policies can significantly improve system performance and reduce power consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20926","fieldValue":" Developing file systems from scratch is difficult and error prone. Using layered, or stackable, file systems is a powerful technique to incrementally extend the functionality of existing file systems on commodity OSes at runtime. In this article, we analyze the evolution of layering from historical models to what is found in four different present day commodity OSes: Solaris, FreeBSD, Linux, and Microsoft Windows. We classify layered file systems into five types based on their functionality and identify the requirements that each class imposes on the OS. We then present five major design issues that we encountered during our experience of developing over twenty layered file systems on four OSes. We discuss how we have addressed each of these issues on current OSes, and present insights into useful OS and VFS features that would provide future developers more versatile solutions for incremental file system development."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20926","fieldValue":"IRP"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20926","fieldValue":"VFS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20927","fieldValue":" This article reviews a recently proposed new class of spin transistors referred to as spin metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (spin MOSFETs), and their integrated circuit applications. The fundamental device structures, operating principle, and theoretically predicted device performance are presented. Spin MOSFETs potentially exhibit significant magnetotransport effects, such as large magneto-current, and also satisfy important requirements for integrated circuit applications such as high transconductance, low power-delay product, and low off-current. Since spin MOSFETs can perform signal processing and logic operations and can store digital data using both charge transport and spin degrees of freedom, they are expected to be building blocks for memory cells and logic gates in spin-electronic integrated circuits. Novel spin-electronic integrated circuit architectures for nonvolatile memory and reconfigurable logic employing spin MOSFETs are also presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20927","fieldValue":"ACM"}
