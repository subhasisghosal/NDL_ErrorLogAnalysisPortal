Our approach fully solves the internal pressure and frictional stresses in a granular material, thereby allows visually noticeable behaviors of granular materials to be reproduced, including freely dispersing splashes without cohesion, and a global coupling between friction and pressure. The full treatment of internal forces in the material also enables two-way interaction with solid bodies. Our method achieves these results at only a very small fraction of computational costs of the comparable particle-based models for granular flows."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16386","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16386","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16387","fieldValue":" It is usually difficult to resolve the fine details of turbulent flows, especially when targeting real-time applications. We present a novel, scalable turbulence method that uses a realistic energy model and an efficient particle representation that allows for the accurate and robust simulation of small-scale detail. We compute transport of turbulent energy using a complete two-equation k-Îµ model with accurate production terms that allows us to capture anisotropic turbulence effects, which integrate smoothly into the base flow. We only require a very low grid resolution to resolve the underlying base flow. As we offload complexity from the fluid solver to the particle system, we can control the detail of the simulation easily by adjusting the number of particles, without changing the large scale behavior. In addition, no computations are wasted on areas that are not visible. We demonstrate that due to the design of our algorithm it is highly suitable for massively parallel architectures, and is able to generate detailed turbulent simulations with millions of particles at high framerates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16388","fieldValue":" We address the problem of Multi-Phase (or Many-Phase) Fluid simulations. We propose to use the regional level set (RLS) that can handle a large number of regions and materials, and hence, is appropriate for simulations of many immiscible materials. Towards this goal, we improve the interpolation of the RLS, and develop the regional level set graph (RLSG), which registers connected components and their contacts, and tracks their properties such as region volumes, film life times, and film material types, as regions evolve, merge, split, or are squeezed into films. Using RLSG's tracking feature, we generate particles from tiny regions or rupturing films."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16388","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16388","fieldValue":"ACM"}
