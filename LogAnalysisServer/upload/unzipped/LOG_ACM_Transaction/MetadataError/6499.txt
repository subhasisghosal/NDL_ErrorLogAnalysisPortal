Our goal is the discovery and analysis of human routines that characterize both individual and group behaviors in terms of location patterns. We develop an unsupervised methodology based on two differing probabilistic topic models and apply them to the daily life of 97 mobile phone users over a 16-month period to achieve these goals. Topic models are probabilistic generative models for documents that identify the latent structure that underlies a set of words. Routines dominating the entire group's activities, identified with a methodology based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, include â\u20ACœgoing to work lateâ\u20AC?, â\u20ACœgoing home earlyâ\u20AC?, â\u20ACœworking nonstopâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœhaving no reception (phone off)â\u20AC? at different times over varying time-intervals. We also detect routines which are characteristic of users, with a methodology based on the Author-Topic model. With the routines discovered, and the two methods of characterizing days and users, we can then perform various tasks. We use the routines discovered to determine behavioral patterns of users and groups of users. For example, we can find individuals that display specific daily routines, such as â\u20ACœgoing to work earlyâ\u20AC? or â\u20ACœturning off the mobile (or having no reception) in the eveningsâ\u20AC?. We are also able to characterize daily patterns by determining the topic structure of days in addition to determining whether certain routines occur dominantly on weekends or weekdays. Furthermore, the routines discovered can be used to rank users or find subgroups of users who display certain routines. We can also characterize users based on their entropy. We compare our method to one based on clustering using K-means. Finally, we analyze an individual's routines over time to determine regions with high variations, which may correspond to specific events."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7327","fieldValue":"Hsu, Jane Yung-Jen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7327","fieldValue":"Lian, Chia-Chun"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7327","fieldValue":"Jih, Wan-Rong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7327","fieldValue":" Recognition of chatting activities in social interactions is useful for constructing human social networks. However, the existence of multiple people involved in multiple dialogues presents special challenges. To model the conversational dynamics of concurrent chatting behaviors, this article advocates Factorial Conditional Random Fields (FCRFs) as a model to accommodate co-temporal relationships among multiple activity states. In addition, to avoid the use of inefficient Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) algorithm, we propose using Iterative Classification Algorithm (ICA) as the inference method for FCRFs. We designed experiments to compare our FCRFs model with two dynamic probabilistic models, Parallel Condition Random Fields (PCRFs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), in learning and decoding based on auditory data. The experimental results show that FCRFs outperform PCRFs and HMMs-like models. We also discover that FCRFs using the ICA inference approach not only improves the recognition accuracy but also takes significantly less time than the LBP inference method."}
