These adaptive versions dynamically scale and shift the tuning sequences to better match the characteristics of the unknown underlying function, as well as the noise level. We test our algorithms on a variety of representative applications in inventory management, health care, revenue management, supply chain management, financial engineering, and queueing theory."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25092","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25092","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25093","fieldValue":" We propose a method for estimating the variance parameter of a discrete, stationary stochastic process that involves combining variance estimators at different run lengths using linear regression. We show that the estimator thus obtained is first-order unbiased and consistent under two distinct asymptotic regimes. In the first regime, the number of constituent estimators used in the regression is fixed and the numbers of observations corresponding to the component estimators grow in a proportional manner. In the second regime, the number of constituent estimators grows while the numbers of observations corresponding to each estimator remain fixed. We also show that for m-dependent stochastic processes, one can use regression to obtain asymptotically normally distributed variance estimators in the second regime. Analytical and numerical examples indicate that the new regression-based estimators give good mean-squared-error performance in steady-state simulations. The regression methodology presented in this article can also be applied to estimate the bias of variance estimators. As an example application, we present a new sequential-stopping rule that uses the estimate for bias to determine appropriate run lengths. Monte Carlo experiments indicate that this â\u20ACœbias-controllingâ\u20AC? sequential-stopping method has the potential to work well in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25094","fieldValue":"Kim, Kyoung-Kuk"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25094","fieldValue":" Stochastic kriging has been studied as an effective metamodeling technique for approximating response surfaces in the context of stochastic simulation. In a simulation experiment, an analyst typically needs to estimate relevant metamodel parameters and further do prediction; therefore, the impact of parameter estimation on the performance of the metamodel-based predictor has drawn some attention in the literature. However, how the standard stochastic kriging predictor is affected by the presence of bias in finite-sample estimates has not yet been fully investigated. In this article, we study the predictive performance and investigate optimal budget allocation rules subject to a fixed computational budget constraint. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to two-level or nested simulation, which has been recently documented in the risk management literature, with biased estimators."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25094","fieldValue":"ACM"}
