Specifically, our framework computes the Deadline Miss Ratio of each message. The core problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Given the intractability of the problem, we also propose several techniques that help to mitigate the running times of our tool. This includes the re-engineering of the problem to run it on GPUs as well as reformulating the MILP itself. Most importantly, we also show how our framework can handle correlations between the queuing events of messages. This is challenging because one cannot apply the convolution operator in the same way as in the case of independent queuing events."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7025","fieldValue":"Yang, Ming-Chang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7025","fieldValue":"Chang, Yuan-Hao"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7025","fieldValue":"Tsao, Che-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7025","fieldValue":" In recent years, phase-change memory (PCM) has generated a great deal of interest because of its byte addressability and nonvolatility properties. It is regarded as a good alternative storage medium that can reduce the performance gap between the main memory and the secondary storage in computing systems. However, its high energy consumption on writes is a challenging issue in the design of battery-powered mobile computing systems. To reduce the energy consumption, we exploit the byte addressability and the asymmetric read-write energy\/latency of PCM in an energy-efficient update scheme for journaling file systems. We also introduce a concept called the 50&percnt; rule to determine\/recommend the best update strategy for block updates. The proposed scheme only writes modified data, instead of the whole updated block, to PCM-based storage devices without extra hardware support. Moreover, it guarantees the sanity\/integrity of file systems even if the computing system crashes or there is a power failure during the data update process. We implemented the proposed scheme on the Linux system and conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the scheme. The results are very encouraging."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7025","fieldValue":"ACM"}
