This article proposes a novel deep learning technique called Field Effect Bilinear Deep Networks (FEBDN) for this problem. To address the difficulties of recognizing incomplete data, we design a novel second-order deep architecture with the Field Effect Restricted Boltzmann Machine, which models the reliability of the delivered information according to the availability of the features. Based on this new architecture, we propose a new three-stage learning procedure with field effect bilinear initialization, field effect abstraction and estimation, and global fine-tuning with missing features adjustment. By integrating the reliability of features into the new learning procedure, the proposed FEBDN can jointly determine the classification boundary and estimate the missing features. FEBDN has demonstrated impressive performance on recognition and estimation tasks in various standard datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3485","fieldValue":"Price, Larry R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3485","fieldValue":" This article proposes and evaluates a novel biometric approach utilizing the internal, nonvisible, anatomical structure of the human eye. The proposed method estimates the anatomical properties of the human oculomotor plant from the measurable properties of human eye movements, utilizing a two-dimensional linear homeomorphic model of the oculomotor plant. The derived properties are evaluated within a biometric framework to determine their efficacy in both verification and identification scenarios. The results suggest that the physical properties derived from the oculomotor plant model are capable of achieving 20.3&percnt; equal error rate and 65.7&percnt; rank-1 identification rate on high-resolution equipment involving 32 subjects, with biometric samples taken over four recording sessions; or 22.2&percnt; equal error rate and 12.6&percnt; rank-1 identification rate on low-resolution equipment involving 172 subjects, with biometric samples taken over two recording sessions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3485","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3485","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25752","fieldValue":" Online video sharing sites are increasingly encouraging their users to connect to the social network venues such as Facebook and Twitter, with goals to boost user interaction and better disseminate the high-quality video content. This in turn provides huge possibilities to conduct cross-network collaboration for personalized video recommendation. However, very few efforts have been devoted to leveraging usersâ\u20AC™ social media profiles in the auxiliary network to capture and personalize their video preferences, so as to recommend videos of interest. In this article, we propose a unified YouTube video recommendation solution by transferring and integrating usersâ\u20AC™ rich social and content information in Twitter network. While general recommender systems often suffer from typical problems like cold-start and data sparsity, our proposed recommendation solution is able to effectively learn from usersâ\u20AC™ abundant auxiliary information on Twitter for enhanced user modeling and well address the typical problems in a unified framework. In this framework, two stages are mainly involved: (1) auxiliary-network data transfer, where user preferences are transferred from an auxiliary network by learning cross-network knowledge associations; and (2) cross-network data integration, where transferred user preferences are integrated with the observed behaviors on a target network in an adaptive fashion. Experimental results show that the proposed cross-network collaborative solution achieves superior performance not only in terms of accuracy, but also in improving the diversity and novelty of the recommended videos."}
