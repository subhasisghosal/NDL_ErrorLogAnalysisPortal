Such systems range from supercomputers with tightly coupled reconfigurable hardware to clusters with reconfigurable devices at each node. The use of these architectures for scientific computing provides an alternative for computationally demanding problems and has advantages in metrics, such as operating cost\/performance and power\/performance. However, performance optimization of these systems can be challenging even with knowledge of the systemâ\u20AC™s characteristics. Our analytic performance model includes parameters representing the reconfigurable hardware, application load imbalance across the nodes, background user load, basic message-passing communication, and processor heterogeneity. In this article, we provide an overview of the analytical model and demonstrate its application for optimization and scheduling of high-performance reconfigurable computing (HPRC) resources. We examine cost functions for minimum runtime and other optimization problems commonly found in shared computing resources. Finally, we discuss additional scheduling issues and other potential applications of the model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6543","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6543","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6544","fieldValue":" Energy\/QoS provisioning is challenging for video applications over lossy wireless network with power-constrained mobile handheld devices. In this work, we exploit the inherent error tolerance of video data to generate a range of acceptable operating points by controlling the amount of errors in the system. In particular, we propose an error-aware video encoding technique, EAVE, that intentionally injects errors while ensuring acceptable QoS. The expanded trade-off space generated by EAVE allows system designers to comparatively evaluate different operating points with varying QoS and energy consumption by aggressively exploiting error-resilience attributes, and could potentially result in significant energy savings. The novelty of our approach resides in active exploitation of errors to vary the operating conditions for further optimization of system parameters. Moreover, we present the adaptivity of our approach by incorporating the feedback from the decoding side to achieve the QoS requirement under the dynamic network status. Our experiments show that EAVE can reduce the energy consumption for an encoding device by up to 37&percnt; for a video conferencing application over a wireless network without quality degradation, compared to a standard video encoding technique over test video streams. Further, our experimental results demonstrate that EAVE can expand the design space by 14 times with respect to energy consumption and by 13 times with respect to video quality (compared to a traditional approach without active error exploitation) on average, over test video streams."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6544","fieldValue":"EAVE: Error-Aware Video Encoding Supporting Extended Energy\/QoS Trade-offs for Mobile Embedded Systems"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6544","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6544","fieldValue":"ACM"}
