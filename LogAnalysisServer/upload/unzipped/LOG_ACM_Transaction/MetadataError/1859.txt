Given a volumetric mesh, we decompose the mesh into several subdomains, build a reduced deformable model for each domain, and connect the domains using inertia coupling. This makes model reduction deformable simulations much more versatile: localized deformations can be supported without prohibitive computational costs, parts can be re-used and precomputation times shortened. Our method does not use constraints, and can handle large domain rigid body motion in addition to large deformations, due to our derivation of the gradient and Hessian of the rotation matrix in polar decomposition. We show real-time examples with multi-level domain hierarchies and hundreds of reduced degrees of freedom."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16489","fieldValue":"FEM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16490","fieldValue":" We propose a new fast and robust method to simulate various types of solid including rigid, plastic and soft bodies as well as one, two and three dimensional structures such as ropes, cloth and volumetric objects. The underlying idea is to use oriented particles that store rotation and spin, along with the usual linear attributes, i.e. position and velocity. This additional information adds substantially to traditional particle methods. First, particles can be represented by anisotropic shapes such as ellipsoids, which approximate surfaces more accurately than spheres. Second, shape matching becomes robust for sparse structures such as chains of particles or even single particles because the undefined degrees of freedom are captured in the rotational states of the particles. Third, the full transformation stored in the particles, including translation and rotation, can be used for robust skinning of graphical meshes and for transforming plastic deformations back into the rest state."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16491","fieldValue":"Sloan, Peter-Pike"}
