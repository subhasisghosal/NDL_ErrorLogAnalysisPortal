This requires solving the Table Maker‚\u20ACôs Dilemma (TMD), which implies a huge amount of CPU computation time. In this article, we consider accelerating such computations, namely the Lef√®vre algorithm on graphics processing units (GPUs), which are massively parallel architectures with a partial single instruction, multiple data execution. We first propose an analysis of the Lef√®vre hard-to-round argument search using the concept of continued fractions. We then propose a new parallel search algorithm that is much more efficient on GPUs thanks to its more regular control flow. We also present an efficient hybrid CPU-GPU deployment of the generation of the polynomial approximations required in the Lef√®vre algorithm. In the end, we manage to obtain overall speedups up to 53.4 √\u2014 on one GPU over a sequential CPU execution and up to 7.1 √\u2014 over a hex-core CPU, which enable a much faster solution of the TMD for the double-precision format."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19478","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Sorbonne Universit&#233;s and CNRS, Paris, France (Fortin, Pierre; Graillat, Stef); LIRMM, CNRS\/Universit&#233; Montpellier 2, Sorbonne Universit&#233;s, and CNRS, Paris, France (Gouicem, Mourad)"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19478","fieldValue":"Lef&egrave;vre algorithm"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19478","fieldValue":"SIMD"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19478","fieldValue":"Table Maker&rsquo;s Dilemma"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2884","fieldValue":" It is necessary to determine a proper arrangement of extracted sentences to generate a well-organized summary from multiple documents. This paper describes our Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) system for TSC-3. It specifically addresses an approach to coherent sentence ordering for MDS. An impediment to the use of chronological ordering, which is widely used by conventional summarization system, is that it arranges sentences without considering the presupposed information of each sentence. We propose a method to improve chronological ordering by resolving precedent information of arranging sentences. Combining the refinement algorithm with topical segmentation and chronological ordering, we address our experiments and metrics to test the effectiveness of MDS tasks. Results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves chronological sentence ordering. At the end of the paper, we also report an outline\/evaluation of important sentence extraction and redundant clause elimination integrated in our MDS system."}
