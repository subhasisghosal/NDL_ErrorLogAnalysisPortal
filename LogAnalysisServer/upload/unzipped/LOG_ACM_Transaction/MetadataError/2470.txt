We give an analysis of a deterministic greedy algorithm that shows that any such function can be approximated to a factor of 1\/(1 + r). For r &equals; k, we give an analysis of a randomized greedy algorithm that shows that any such function can be approximated to a factor of 1\/(1+&sqrt;k\/2. In the case of k &equals; r &equals; 2, the considered functions correspond precisely to bisubmodular functions, in which case we obtain an approximation guarantee of 1\/2. We show that, as in the case of submodular functions, this result is the best possible both in the value query model and under the assumption that NP â\u2030  RP. Extending a result of Ando et al., we show that for any k &ges; 3, submodularity in every orthant and pairwise monotonicity (i.e., r &equals; 2) precisely characterize k-submodular functions. Consequently, we obtain an approximation guarantee of 1\/3 (and thus independent of k) for the maximization problem of k-submodular functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2721","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2721","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18350","fieldValue":"Remark on â\u20ACœAlgorithm 506: HQR3 and EXCHNG: Fortran Subroutines for Calculating and Ordering the Eigenvalues of a Real Upper Hessenberg Matrixâ\u20AC?"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18351","fieldValue":"Remark on â\u20ACœAlgorithms 508 and 509: Matrix Bandwidth and Profile Reduction and A Hybrid Profile Reduction Algorithâ\u20AC?"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18351","fieldValue":"ACM"}
