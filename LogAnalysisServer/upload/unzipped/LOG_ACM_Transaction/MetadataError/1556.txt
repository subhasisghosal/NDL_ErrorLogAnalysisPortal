In this paper, we present an easy to implement technique for accelerating the computation of indirect illumination for an animated sequence using stochastic ray tracing. We begin by computing a quick but noisy solution using a small number of sample rays at each sample location. The variation of these noisy solutions over time is then used to create a smooth basis. Finally, the noisy solutions are projected onto the smooth basis to produce the final solution. The resulting animation has greatly reduced spatial and temporal noise, and a computational cost roughly equivalent to the noisy, low sample computation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15716","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15716","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2490","fieldValue":" The Sort Transform (ST) can significantly speed up the block sorting phase of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) by sorting the limited order contexts. However, the best result obtained so far for the inverse ST has a time complexity O(Nlog k) and a space complexity O(N), where N and k are the text size and the context order of the transform, respectively. In this article, we present a novel algorithm that can compute the inverse ST for any k-order contexts in an O(N) time and space complexity, a linear result independent of k. The main idea behind the design of this linear algorithm is a set of cycle properties of k-order contexts that we explore for this work. These newly discovered cycle properties allow us to quickly compute the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) between any pair of adjacent k-order contexts that may belong to two different cycles, which eventually leads to the proposed linear-time solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15717","fieldValue":" Multidimensional lightcuts is a new scalable method for efficiently rendering rich visual effects such as motion blur, participating media, depth of field, and spatial anti-aliasing in complex scenes. It introduces a flexible, general rendering framework that unifies the handling of such effects by discretizing the integrals into large sets of gather and light points and adaptively approximating the sum of all possible gather-light pair interactions.We create an implicit hierarchy, the product graph, over the gather-light pairs to rapidly and accurately approximate the contribution from hundreds of millions of pairs per pixel while only evaluating a tiny fraction (e.g., 200--1,000). We build upon the techniques of the prior Lightcuts method for complex illumination at a point, however, by considering the complete pixel integrals, we achieve much greater efficiency and scalability.Our example results demonstrate efficient handling of volume scattering, camera focus, and motion of lights, cameras, and geometry. For example, enabling high quality motion blur with 256x temporal sampling requires only a 6.7x increase in shading cost in a scene with complex moving geometry, materials, and illumination."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15717","fieldValue":"ACM"}
