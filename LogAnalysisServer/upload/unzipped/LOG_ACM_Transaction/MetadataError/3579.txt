Accent modeling of non-native speech is definitely challenging, because the acoustic properties in highly-accented speech pronounced by non-native speakers are quite divergent. The aim of this study is to generate highly Mandarin-accented English models for speakers whose mother tongue is Mandarin. First, a two-stage, state-based verification method is proposed to extract the state-level, highly-accented speech segments automatically. Acoustic features and articulatory features are successively used for robust verification of the extracted speech segments. Second, Gaussian components of the highly-accented speech models are generated from the corresponding Gaussian components of the native speech models using a linear transformation function. A decision tree is constructed to categorize the transformation functions and used for transformation function retrieval to deal with the data sparseness problem. Third, a discrimination function is further applied to verify the generated accented acoustic models. Finally, the successfully verified accented English models are integrated into the native bilingual phone model set for Mandarin-English bilingual speech recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively alleviate recognition performance degradation due to accents and can obtain absolute improvements of 4.1%, 1.8%, and 2.7% in word accuracy for bilingual speech recognition compared to that using traditional ASR approaches, MAP-adapted, and MLLR-adapted ASR methods, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3071","fieldValue":"Model Generation of Accented Speech using Model Transformation and Verification for Bilingual Speech Recognition"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3071","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3071","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21621","fieldValue":" Monitoring aquatic environment is of great interest to the ecosystem, marine life, and human health. This article presents the design and implementation of Sambaâ\u20AC\u201Dan aquatic surveillance robot that integrates an off-the-shelf Android smartphone and a robotic fish to monitor harmful aquatic processes such as oil spills and harmful algal blooms. Using the built-in camera of the smartphone, Samba can detect spatially dispersed aquatic processes in dynamic and complex environment. To reduce the excessive false alarms caused by the nonwater area (e.g., trees on the shore), Samba segments the captured images and performs target detection in the identified water area only. However, a major challenge in the design of Samba is the high energy consumption resulted from continuous image segmentation. We propose a novel approach that leverages the power-efficient inertial sensors on smartphones to assist image processing. In particular, based on the learned mapping models between inertial and visual features, Samba uses real-time inertial sensor readings to estimate the visual features that guide image segmentation, significantly reducing the energy consumption and computation overhead. Samba also features a set of lightweight and robust computer vision algorithms, which detect harmful aquatic processes based on their distinctive color features. Last, Samba employs a feedback-based rotation control algorithm to adapt to spatiotemporal development of the target aquatic process. We have implemented a Samba prototype and evaluated it through extensive field experiments, lab experiments, and trace-driven simulations. The results show that Samba can achieve a 94&percnt; detection rate, a 5&percnt; false alarm rate, and a lifetime up to nearly 2 months."}
