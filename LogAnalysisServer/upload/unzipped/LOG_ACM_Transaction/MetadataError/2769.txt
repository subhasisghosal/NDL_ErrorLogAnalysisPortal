The code is complete with user selectable reporting facilities, numerical and analytic derivatives, derivative checking, and many more features. The foundation for the algorithm is a stable and efficient trust region Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer that exploits the structure of the orthogonal distance regression problem. ODRPACK95 was created to extend the functionality and usability of ODRPACK. ODRPACK95 adds bound constraints, uses the newer Fortran 95 language, and simplifies the interface to the user called subroutine."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19182","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19182","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19183","fieldValue":" This remark details correction for errors in the functions which compute the modified Bessel function of the second kind and the log of the gamma function. In both cases these errors cause a loss of precision for a small range of values of the Î½ argument. These routines are used in the calculation of a number of other functions within the package whose accuracy is thus similarly affected."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19183","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19183","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19184","fieldValue":" This article is concerned with the efficient numerical solution of the Lyapunov equation $A^T X &plus; XA &equls; âˆ\u2019C with a stable matrix A and a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix C of possibly small rank.
