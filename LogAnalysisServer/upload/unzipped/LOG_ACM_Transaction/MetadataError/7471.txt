{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9752","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study the computational complexity and effectiveness of a concept we term \"N-hub Shortest-Path Routing\" in IP networks. N-hub Shortest-Path Routing allows the ingress node of a routing domain to determine up to N intermediate nodes (\"hubs\") through which a packet will pass before reaching its final destination. This facilitates better utilization of the network resources, while allowing the network routers to continue to employ the simple and well-known shortest-path routing paradigm. Although this concept has been proposed in the past, this paper is the first to investigate it in depth. We apply N-hub Shortest-Path Routing to the problem of minimizing the maximum load in the network. We show that the resulting routing problem is NP-complete and hard to approximate. However, we propose efficient algorithms for solving it both in the online and the offline contexts. Our results show that N-hub Shortest-Path Routing can increase network utilization significantly even for N = 1. Hence, this routing paradigm should be considered as a powerful mechanism for future datagram routing in the Internet."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9752","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9753","fieldValue":"McKeown, Nick"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9753","fieldValue":" Internet routers and Ethernet switches contain packet buffers to hold packets during times of congestion. Packet buffers are at the heart of every packet switch and router, which have a combined annual market of tens of billions of dollars, and equipment vendors spend hundreds of millions of dollars on memory each year. Designing packet buffers used to be easy: DRAM was cheap, low power and widely used. But something happened at 10 Gb\/s when packets started to arrive and depart faster than the access time of a DRAM. Alternative memories were needed, but SRAM is too expensive and power-hungry. A caching solution is appealing, with a hierarchy of SRAM and DRAM, as used by the computer industry. However, in switches and routers it is not acceptable to have a \"miss-rate\" as it reduces throughput and breaks pipelines. In this paper we describe how to build caches with 100% hit-rate under all conditions, by exploiting the fact that switches and routers always store data in FIFO queues. We describe a number of different ways to do it, with and without pipelining, with static or dynamic allocation of memory. In each case, we prove a lower bound on how big the cache needs to be, and propose an algorithm that meets, or comes close, to the lower bound. These techniques are practical and have been implemented in fast silicon; as a result, we expect the techniques to fundamentally change the way switches and routers use external memory."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9753","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9754","fieldValue":"He, Si-Min"}
