The translation framework is incorporated into a multilingual dialogue system in which a student is able to engage in natural spoken interaction with the system in the foreign language, while speaking a query in their native tongue at any time to obtain a spoken translation for language assistance. Thus the quality of the translation must be extremely high, but the domain is restricted. Experiments were conducted in the weather information domain with the scenario of a native English speaker learning Mandarin Chinese. We were able to utilize a large corpus of English weather-domain queries to explore and compare a variety of translation strategies: formal, example-based, and statistical. Translation quality was manually evaluated on a test set of 695 spontaneous utterances. The best speech translation performance (89.9&percnt; correct, 6.1&percnt; incorrect, and 4.0&percnt; rejected), is achieved by a system which combines the formal and example-based methods, using parsability by a domain-specific Chinese grammar as a rejection criterion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23023","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23023","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23024","fieldValue":" This article presents a multidocument, multilingual, theme-based summarization system based on modeling text cohesion (story flow). Conventional extractive summarization systems which pick out salient sentences to include in a summary often disregard any flow or sequence that might exist between these sentences. We argue that such inherent text cohesion exists and is (1) specific to a particular story and (2) specific to a particular language. Documents within the same story, and in the same language, share a common story flow, and this flow differs across stories, and across languages. We propose using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) as story models. An unsupervised segmental K-means method is used to iteratively cluster multiple documents into different topics (stories) and learn the parameters of parallel Hidden Markov Story Models (HMSM), one for each story. We compare story models within and across stories and within and across languages (English and Chinese). The experimental results support our ‚\u20ACúone story, one flow‚\u20AC? and ‚\u20ACúone language, one flow‚\u20AC? hypotheses. We also propose a Na√Øve Bayes classifier for document summarization. The performance of our summarizer is superior to conventional methods that do not incorporate text cohesion information. Our HMSM method also provides a simple way to compile a single metasummary for multiple documents from individual summaries via state labeled sentences."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23025","fieldValue":" This article considers the problem of automatic paragraph segmentation. The task is relevant for speech-to-text applications whose output transcipts do not usually contain punctuation or paragraph indentation and are naturally difficult to read and process. Text-to-text generation applications (e.g., summarization) could also benefit from an automatic paragaraph segementation mechanism which indicates topic shifts and provides visual targets to the reader. We present a paragraph segmentation model which exploits a variety of knowledge sources (including textual cues, syntactic and discourse-related information) and evaluate its performance in different languages and domains. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms our baselines and in many cases comes to within a few percent of human performance. Finally, we integrate our method with a single document summarizer and show that it is useful for structuring the output of automatically generated text."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23025","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23025","fieldValue":"ACM"}
