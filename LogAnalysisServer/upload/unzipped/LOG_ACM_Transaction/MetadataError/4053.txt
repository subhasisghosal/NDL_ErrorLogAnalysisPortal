{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23057","fieldValue":" This article presents a user model for user simulation and a system state representation in spoken decision support dialogue systems. When selecting from a group of alternatives, users apply different decision-making criteria with different priorities. At the beginning of the dialogue, however, users often do not have a definite goal or criteria in which they place value, thus they can learn about new features while interacting with the system and accordingly create new criteria. In this article, we present a user model and dialogue state representation that accommodate these patterns by considering the user's knowledge and preferences. To estimate the parameters used in the user model, we implemented a trial sightseeing guidance system, collected dialogue data, and trained a user simulator. Since the user parameters are not observable from the system, the dialogue is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and a dialogue state representation was introduced based on the model. We then optimized its dialogue strategy so that users can make better choices. The dialogue strategy is evaluated using a user simulator trained from a large number of dialogues collected using a trial dialogue system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23057","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23057","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23058","fieldValue":"Introduction to the special issue on speech and language processing of children's speech for child-machine interaction applications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23058","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23058","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23059","fieldValue":" In this article, we focus on keyword detection in children's speech as it is needed in voice command systems. We use the FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus which contains emotionally colored spontaneous children's speech recorded in a child-robot interaction scenario and investigate various recent keyword spotting techniques. As the principle of bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) is known to be well-suited for context-sensitive phoneme prediction, we incorporate a BLSTM network into a Tandem model for flexible coarticulation modeling in children's speech. Our experiments reveal that the Tandem model prevails over a triphone-based Hidden Markov Model approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23059","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23059","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23060","fieldValue":" This article presents a description of the INESC-ID Age and Gender classification systems which were developed for aiding the detection of child abuse material within the scope of the European project I-DASH. The Age and Gender classification systems are composed respectively by the fusion of four and six individual subsystems trained with short- and long-term acoustic and prosodic features, different classification strategies, Gaussian Mixture Models-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), trained over five different speech corpus. The best results obtained by the calibration and linear logistic regression fusion back-end show an absolute improvement of 2&percnt; on the unweighted accuracy value for the Age and 1&percnt; for the Gender when compared to the best individual frontend systems in the development set. The final age\/gender detection system evaluated using a six-hour child abuse (CA) test set achieved promising results given the extremely difficult conditions of this type of video material. In order to further improve the performance in the CA domain, the classification modules were adapted using unsupervised selection of training data. An automatic data selection algorithm using frame-level posterior probabilities was developed. Performance improvement after adapting the classification modules was around 10&percnt; relative when compared with the baseline classifiers."}
