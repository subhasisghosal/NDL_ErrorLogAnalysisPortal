In this paper, we describe a processing pipeline for dealing with complex light sources from acquisition to global illumination rendering. We carefully design optical filters to guarantee high precision measurements of real-world light sources. We discuss two practically feasible setups that allow us to measure light sources with different characteristics. Finally, we introduce an efficient importance sampling algorithm for our representation that can be used, for example, in conjunction with Photon Maps."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15341","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15341","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15342","fieldValue":" This paper presents a new interactive rendering and display technique for complex scenes with expensive shading, such as global illumination. Our approach combines sparsely sampled shading (points) and analytically computed discontinuities (edges) to interactively generate high-quality images. The edge-and-point image is a new compact representation that combines edges and points such that fast, table-driven interpolation of pixel shading from nearby point samples is possible, while respecting discontinuities.The edge-and-point renderer is extensible, permitting the use of arbitrary shaders to collect shading samples. Shading discontinuities, such as silhouettes and shadow edges, are found at interactive rates. Our software implementation supports interactive navigation and object manipulation in scenes that include expensive lighting effects (such as global illumination) and geometrically complex objects. For interactive rendering we show that high-quality images of these scenes can be rendered at 8--14 frames per second on a desktop PC: a speedup of 20--60 over a ray tracer computing a single sample per pixel."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15343","fieldValue":" We present a versatile and complete free-form shape modeling framework for point-sampled geometry. By combining unstructured point clouds with the implicit surface definition of the moving least squares approximation, we obtain a hybrid geometry representation that allows us to exploit the advantages of implicit and parametric surface models. Based on this representation we introduce a shape modeling system that enables the designer to perform large constrained deformations as well as boolean operations on arbitrarily shaped objects. Due to minimum consistency requirements, point-sampled surfaces can easily be re-structured on the fly to support extreme geometric deformations during interactive editing. In addition, we show that strict topology control is possible and sharp features can be generated and preserved on point-sampled objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on a large set of input models, including noisy range scans, irregular point clouds, and sparsely as well as densely sampled models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15343","fieldValue":"ACM"}
