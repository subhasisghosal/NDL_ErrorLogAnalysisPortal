Besides two spatial dimensions, they are resolved in time of flight. Cost-efficient approaches for their capture use amplitude modulated continuous wave lidar systems but typically take more than a minute of capture time. We propose new techniques for measurement and reconstruction of transient images, which drastically reduce this capture time. To this end, we pose the problem of reconstruction as a trigonometric moment problem. A vast body of mathematical literature provides powerful solutions to such problems. In particular, the maximum entropy spectral estimate and the Pisarenko estimate provide two closed-form solutions for reconstruction using continuous densities or sparse distributions, respectively. Both methods can separate m distinct returns using measurements at m modulation frequencies. For m = 3 our experiments with measured data confirm this. Our GPU-accelerated implementation can reconstruct more than 100000 frames of a transient image per second. Additionally, we propose modifications of the capture routine to achieve the required sinusoidal modulation without increasing the capture time. This allows us to capture up to 18.6 transient images per second, leading to transient video. An important byproduct is a method for removal of multipath interference in range imaging."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17456","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17456","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2651","fieldValue":" Sequence representations supporting the queries access, select, and rank are at the core of many data structures. There is a considerable gap between the various upper bounds and the few lower bounds known for such representations, and how they relate to the space used. In this article, we prove a strong lower bound for rank, which holds for rather permissive assumptions on the space used, and give matching upper bounds that require only a compressed representation of the sequence. Within this compressed space, the operations access and select can be solved in constant or almost-constant time, which is optimal for large alphabets. Our new upper bounds dominate all of the previous work in the time\/space map."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2651","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2651","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17457","fieldValue":" Wire wrapping is a traditional form of handmade jewelry that involves bending metal wire to create intricate shapes. The technique appeals to novices and casual crafters because of its low cost, accessibility and unique aesthetic. We present a computational design tool that addresses the two main challenges of creating 2D wire-wrapped jewelry: decomposing an input drawing into a set of wires, and bending the wires to give them shape. Our main contribution is an automatic wire decomposition algorithm that segments a drawing into a small number of wires based on aesthetic and fabrication principles. We formulate the task as a constrained graph labeling problem and present a stochastic optimization approach that produces good results for a variety of inputs. Given a decomposition, our system generates a 3D-printed custom support structure, or jig, that helps users bend the wire into the appropriate shape. We validated our wire decomposition algorithm against existing wire-wrapped designs, and used our end-to-end system to create new jewelry from clipart drawings. We also evaluated our approach with novice users, who were able to create various pieces of jewelry in less than half an hour."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17457","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17457","fieldValue":"ACM"}
