In this paper, we overcome these limitations by introducing a general node-isolation model for heavy-tailed user lifetimes and arbitrary neighbor-se-lection algorithms. Using this model, we analyze two age-biased neighbor-selection strategies and show that they significantly improve the residual lifetimes of chosen users, which dramatically reduces the probability of user isolation and graph partitioning compared with uniform selection of neighbors. In fact, the second strategy based on random walks on age-proportional graphs demonstrates that, for lifetimes with infinite variance, the system monotonically increases its resilience as its age and size grow. Specifically, we show that the probability of isolation converges to zero as these two metrics tend to infinity. We finish the paper with simulations in finite-size graphs that demonstrate the effect of this result in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9823","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9823","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9823","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1890","fieldValue":"Carlson, Trevor E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1890","fieldValue":" Computer architects rely heavily on microarchitecture simulation to evaluate design alternatives. Unfortunately, cycle-accurate simulation is extremely slow, being at least 4 to 6 orders of magnitude slower than real hardware. This longstanding problem is further exacerbated in the multi-&sol;many-core era, because single-threaded simulation performance has not improved much, while the design space has expanded substantially. Parallel simulation is a promising approach, yet does not completely solve the simulation challenge. Furthermore, existing sampling techniques, which are widely used for single-threaded applications, do not readily apply to multithreaded applications as thread interaction and synchronization must now be taken into account. This work presents PCantorSim, a novel Cantor set (a classic fractal)--based sampling scheme to accelerate parallel simulation of multithreaded applications. Through the use of the proposed methodology, only less than 5&percnt; of an application's execution time is simulated in detail. We have implemented our approach in Sniper (a parallel multicore simulator) and evaluated it by running the PARSEC benchmarks on a simulated 8-core system. The results show that PCantorSim increases simulation speed over detailed parallel simulation by a factor of 20Ã\u2014, on average, with an average absolute execution time prediction error of 5.3&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1890","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1890","fieldValue":"ACM"}
