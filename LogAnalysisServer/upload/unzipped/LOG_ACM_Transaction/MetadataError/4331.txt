We combine features of the unstructured lumigraph algorithm and image fidelity metrics to efficiently rank the perceptual impact of the removal of subregions of input views (subviews). We use a greedy approach to estimate the order in which subviews should be pruned to minimize perceptual degradation at each step. Renderings using varying numbers of subviews can then be easily visualized with confidence that the retained subviews are well chosen, thus facilitating the choice of how many to retain. The regions of the input views that are left are repacked into a texture atlas. Our method takes advantage of any scene geometry information available but only requires a very coarse approximation. We perform a user study to validate its behaviour, as well as investigate the impact of the choice of image fidelity metric as well as that of user parameters. The three metrics considered fall in the physical, statistical and perceptual categories. The overall benefit of our method is the semiautomation of the view selection process, resulting in unstructured lumigraphs that are thriftier in texture memory use and faster to render. Using the same framework, we adjust the parameters of the unstructured lumigraph algorithm to optimise it on a scene by scene basis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24007","fieldValue":" We address the problem of adaptive compression of natural language text, considering the case where the receiver is much less powerful than the sender, as in mobile applications. Our techniques achieve compression ratios around 32&percnt; and require very little effort from the receiver. Furthermore, the receiver is not only lighter, but it can also search the compressed text with less work than that necessary to decompress it. This is a novelty in two senses: it breaks the usual compressor\/decompressor symmetry typical of adaptive schemes, and it contradicts the long-standing assumption that only semistatic codes could be searched more efficiently than the uncompressed text. Our novel compression methods are preferable in several aspects over the existing adaptive and semistatic compressors for natural language texts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24008","fieldValue":" PageRank is one of the most important ranking techniques used in today's search engines. A recent very interesting research track focuses on exploiting efficient numerical methods to speed up the computation of PageRank, among which the Arnoldi-type algorithm and the GMRES algorithm are competitive candidates. In essence, the former deals with the PageRank problem from an eigenproblem, while the latter from a linear system, point of view. However, there is little known about the relations between the two approaches for PageRank. In this article, we focus on a theoretical and numerical comparison of the two approaches. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results."}
