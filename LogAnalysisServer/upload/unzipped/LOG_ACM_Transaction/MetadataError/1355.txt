The points could be measurements from a physical phenomenon, and the objective in this process could be to find patterns among the points and describe the phenomenon analytically. The points could be measurements from a geometric model, and the objective could be to reconstruct the model by a combination of parametric curves. The algorithm proposed here can be used in various applications, especially where given points are dense and noisy. Examples demonstrating the behavior of the algorithm under noise and density of the points are presented and discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15188","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15188","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15189","fieldValue":" We introduce the notion of image-driven simplification, a framework that uses images to decide which portions of a model to simplify. This is a departure from approaches that make polygonal simplification decisions based on geometry. As with many methods, we use the edge collapse operator to make incremental changes to a model. Unique to our approach, however, is the use at comparisons between images of the original model against those of a simplified model to determine the cost of an ease collapse. We use common graphics rendering hardware to accelerate the creation of the required images. As expected, this method produces models that are close to the original model according to image differences. Perhaps more surprising, however, is that the method yields models that have high geometric fidelity as well. Our approach also solves the quandary of how to weight the geometric distance versus appearance properties such as normals, color, and texture. All of these trade-offs are balanced by the image metric. Benefits of this approach include high fidelity silhouettes, extreme simplification of hidden portions of a model, attention to shading interpolation effects, and simplification that is sensitive to the content of a texture. In order to better preserve the appearance of textured models, we introduce a novel technique for assigning texture coordinates to the new vertices of the mesh. This method is based on a geometric heuristic that can be integrated with any edge collapse algorithm to produce high quality textured surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15189","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15189","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2438","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of embedding a directed graph onto evenly spaced points on a circle while minimizing the total weighted edge length. We present the first poly-logarithmic approximation factor algorithm for this problem which yields an approximation factor of O(log n log log n), thus improving the previous Ã\u2022(&sqrt;n) approximation factor. In order to achieve this, we introduce a new problem which we call the directed penalized linear arrangement. This problem generalizes both the directed feedback edge set problem and the directed linear arrangement problem. We present an O(log n log log n)-approximation factor algorithm for this newly defined problem. Our solution uses two distinct directed metrics (â\u20ACœrightâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœleftâ\u20AC?) which together yield a lower bound on the value of an optimal solution. In addition, we define a sequence of new directed spreading metrics that are used for applying the algorithm recursively on smaller subgraphs. The new spreading metrics allow us to define an asymmetric region growing procedure that accounts simultaneously for both incoming and outgoing edges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a region growing procedure is defined in directed graphs that allows for such an accounting."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2438","fieldValue":"ACM"}
