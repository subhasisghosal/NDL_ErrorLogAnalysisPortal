{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10989","fieldValue":" Due to the lossy nature of wireless links, it is difficult to determine if packet losses are due to wireless-induced effects or from malicious discarding. Many prior efforts on detecting malicious packet drops rely on evidence collected via passive monitoring by neighbor nodes. However, they do not analyze the cause of packet losses. In this paper, we ask: 1 Given certain macroscopic parameters of the network like traffic intensity and node density what is the likelihood that evidence exists with respect to a transmission? 2 How can these parameters be used to perform a forensic analysis of the reason for the losses? Toward answering the above questions, we first build an analytical framework that computes the likelihood that evidence we call this transmission evidence, or TE for short exists with respect to transmissions, in terms of a set of network parameters. We validate our analytical framework via both simulations as well as real-world experiments on two different wireless testbeds. The analytical framework is then used as a basis for a protocol within a forensic analyzer to assess the cause of packet losses and determine the likelihood of forwarding misbehaviors. Through simulations, we find that our assessments are close to the ground truth in all examined cases, with an average deviation of 2.3% from the ground truth and a worst case deviation of 15.0%."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10989","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10989","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10989","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10990","fieldValue":"Yi Qin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10990","fieldValue":"Riheng Jia"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10990","fieldValue":"Jinbei Zhang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10990","fieldValue":"Weijie Wu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10990","fieldValue":"Xinbing Wang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10990","fieldValue":" This paper investigates the multicast capacity of static wireless social networks. We adopt the two-layer network model, which includes the social layer and the networking layer. In the social layer, the social group size of each source node is modeled as power-law distribution. Moreover, the rank-based model is utilized to describe the relation between source and destinations in the networking layer. Based on the two-layer network model, the probability density function PDF of the destination positions is analyzed and verified by numerical simulation, which is different from the traditional ad hoc networks. According to the PDF, the bound of the network capacity is derived, and we propose a Euclidean minimum-spanning-tree-based transmission scheme, which is proved to achieve the order of capacity bound for most cases. Finally, the capacity of social networks is compared to the traditional multicast ad hoc networks, which indicates that the capacity scaling performs better in social networks than traditional ones. To our best knowledge, this is the first work of analyzing the impact on the capacity of social relation and group size in multicast ad hoc networks for the rank-based model."}
