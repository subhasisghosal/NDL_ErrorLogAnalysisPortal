However, because of the phenomenon of false-positive reads, RFID data streams resemble noisy analog measurements rather than the desired recordings of activities within a business process. The present study investigates the use of data mining techniques for filtering and aggregating raw RFID data. We consider classifiers based on logistic regression, decision trees, and artificial neural networks using attributes derived from low-level reader data. In addition, we present a custom-made algorithm for generating decision rules using artificial attributes and an iterative training procedure. We evaluate the classifiers using a massive set of data on pallet movements collected under real-world conditions at one of the largest retailers worldwide. The results clearly indicate high classification performance of the classification models, with the rule-based classifier outperforming all others. Moreover, we show that utilizing the full spectrum of data generated by the reader hardware leads to superior performance compared with the approaches based on timestamp and antenna information proposed in prior research."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8220","fieldValue":"RFID"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8220","fieldValue":"Classification Models for RFID-Based Real-Time Detection of Process Events in the Supply Chain: An Empirical Study"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8118","fieldValue":"Issue 3(Special Issue on Complexity of Systems Evolution: Requirements Engineering Perspective), January 2015"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8221","fieldValue":" Walking on water, and programming according to specifications is easyâ\u20AC\u201Das long as both of them are frozen. --Robert Glass This introduction discusses the changing nature of complexity associated with requirements engineering (RE) tasks and how it has shifted from managing internal complexity to adapting and leveraging upon external and dynamic complexity. We note several significant drivers in the requirements knowledge that have resulted in this change and discuss in light of complexity theory how the RE research community can respond to this. We observe several research challenges associated with â\u20ACœnew complexityâ\u20AC? and highlight how the articles included in the special issue advance the field by defining complexity more accurately, observing more vigilantly new sources of complexity, and suggesting new ways to manage complexity in terms of economic assessments, knowledge flows, and modeling for adaptability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8221","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8221","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8222","fieldValue":" The probability of IT project failures can be mitigated more successfully when discovered early. To support a more insightful management of IT projects, which may also facilitate an early detection of IT project failures, transparency regarding a project's cash flows shall be increased. Therefore, an appropriate analysis of a project's benefits, costs, requirements, their respective risks and interdependencies is inevitable. However, to date, in requirements engineering only few methods exist that appropriately consider these factors when estimating the ex ante project business case. Furthermore, empirical studies reveal that a lot of risk factors emerge during the runtime of projects why the ex ante valuation of IT projects even with respect to requirements seems insufficient. Therefore, using the Action Design Research approach, we design, apply, and evaluate a practicable method for value-based continuous IT project steering especially for large-scale IT projects."}
