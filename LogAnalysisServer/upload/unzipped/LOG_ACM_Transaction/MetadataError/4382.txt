We present a methodology for measuring participants' beliefs and confidence about the efficacy of treatment before, during, and after search episodes. We consider interventions studied in the Cochrane collection of meta-analyses. We extract related queries from search engine logs and consider the Cochrane assessments as ground truth. We analyze the dynamics of belief over time and show the influence of prior beliefs and confidence at the end of sessions. We present evidence for confirmation bias and for anchoring-and-adjustment during search and retrieval. Then, we build predictive models to estimate postsearch beliefs using sets of features about behavior and content. The findings provide insights about the influence of Web content on the beliefs of people and have implications for the design of search systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24130","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24130","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24131","fieldValue":"Dang, Edward Kai FUNG"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24131","fieldValue":" The inverted index is the dominant indexing method in information retrieval systems. It enables fast return of the list of all documents containing a given query term. However, for retrieval schemes involving query expansion, as in pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), the retrieval time based on an inverted index increases linearly with the number of expansion terms. In this regard, we have examined the use of a forward index, which consists of the mapping of each document to its constituent terms. We propose a novel forward index-based reranking scheme to shorten the PRF retrieval time. In our method, a first retrieval of the original query is performed using an inverted index, and then a forward index is employed for the PRF part. We have studied several new forward indexes, including using a novel spstring data structure and the weighted variable bit-block compression (wvbc) signature. With modern hardware such as solid-state drives (SSDs) and sufficiently large main memory, forward index methods are particularly promising. We find that with the whole index stored in main memory, PRF retrieval using a spstring or wvbc forward index excels in time efficiency over an inverted index, being able to obtain the same levels of performance measures at shorter times."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24131","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24131","fieldValue":"ACM"}
