{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20061","fieldValue":" The theory of abstract data types is generalized to the case of nondeterministic operations (set-valuedfunctions). Since the nondeterminism of operations may be coupled, signatures are extended so that operations can have results in Cartesian products. Input\/output behavior is used to characterize implementation of one model by another. It is described by means of accumulated arrows, which form a generalization of the term algebra. Morphisms of nondeterministic models are introduced. Both innovations prove to be powerful tools in the analysis of input\/output behavior. Extraction equivalence and observable equivalence of values are investigated. Quotient models for such equivalence relations are constructed. The equivalence relations are compared with each other, with separation of values by means of experiments, and with the separation property that characterizes a terminal model. Examples are given to show that the four concepts are different. In deterministic models the concepts coincide."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2920","fieldValue":"Kuo, Jin-Shea"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2920","fieldValue":"Yang, Ying-Kuei"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2920","fieldValue":" This article proposes an approach for the automatic extraction of transliteration pairs from Chinese Web corpora. In this approach, we formulate the machine transliteration process using a syllable-based phonetic similarity model which consists of phonetic confusion matrices and a Chinese character n-gram language model. With the phonetic similarity model, the extraction of transliteration pairs becomes a two-step process of recognition followed by validation: First, in the recognition process, we identify the most probable transliteration in the k-neighborhood of a recognized English word. Then, in the validation process, we qualify the transliteration pair candidates with a hypothesis test. We carry out an analytical study on the statistics of several key factors in English-Chinese transliteration to help formulate phonetic similarity modeling. We then conduct both supervised and unsupervised learning of a phonetic similarity model on a development database. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the phonetic similarity model by achieving an F-measure of 0.739 in supervised learning. The unsupervised learning approach works almost as well as the supervised one, thus allowing us to deploy automatic extraction of transliteration pairs in the Web space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2920","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2920","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20062","fieldValue":" Systems semantics extends the denotational semantics of programming languages to a semantics for the description of arbitrary systems, including objects that are not computations in any sense. By defining different meaning functions, the same formal description may be used to denote different system properties, such as structure, behavior, component cost, and performance aspects (e.g., timing).The definition of these semantic functions also provides guidance in language design, in particular for the match between language constructs and the system concepts to be expressed. Aiming at compositionality ensures useful properties for formal manipulation. In this fashion, the meaning functions can be made sufficiently simple to serve not only as a direct implementation on a machine but also as rules for reasoning about systems in a transformational manner. As the applications show, however, compositionality can be ensured only through careful consideration of the characteristics of the flow of information inside the system.Two classes of application are discussed:Unidirectional systems, in particular digital systems without feedback (combinational) and with feedback (sequential), and a certain class of analog systems.Nonunidirectional systems, in particular two-port analog networks. The emphasis will be on the functional style of description and on formal reasoning (theorem proving, derivation of properties).Implementation and rapid prototyping strategies in various system description environments are also briefly discussed. These would permit the concepts of system semantics to be explored without the need for a complete implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20062","fieldValue":"ACM"}
