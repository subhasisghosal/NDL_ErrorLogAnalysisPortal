Such information management systems must allow querying in simple ways, mostly by a form of searching. Motivated by these developments, we propose a theory of search queries in a general model of dataspaces. In this model, a dataspace is a collection of data objects, where each data object is a collection of data items. Basic search queries are expressed using filters on data items, following the basic model of Boolean search in information retrieval. We characterize semantically the class of queries that can be expressed by searching. We apply our theory to classical relational databases, where we connect search queries to the known class of fully generic queries, and to dataspaces where data items are formed by attribute-value pairs. We also extend our theory to a more powerful, associative form of searching, where one can ask for objects that are similar to objects satisfying given search conditions. Such associative search queries are shown to correspond to a very limited kind of joins. We show that the basic search language extended with associative search can exactly define the queries definable in a restricted fragment of the semijoin algebra working on an explicit relational representation of the dataspace."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14524","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14524","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1165","fieldValue":" This article presents a semantics-based context-aware dynamic service composition framework that composes an application through combining distributed components based on the semantics of components and contexts of users. The proposed framework consists of Component Service Model with Semantics (CoSMoS), Component Runtime Environment (CoRE), and Semantic Graph based Service Composition (SeGSeC). CoSMoS models the semantics of components and contexts of users. CoRE is a middleware to support CoSMoS on various distributed computing technologies. SeGSeC is a mechanism to compose an application by synthesizing its workflow based on the semantics of components and contexts of users. The proposed framework is capable of composing applications requested in a natural language by leveraging the semantic information of components. The proposed framework composes applications differently to individual users based on their contexts and preferences. The proposed framework acquires user preferences from user-specified rules and also via learning. The proposed framework also adapts to dynamic environments by autonomously composing a new application upon detecting context change. This article describes the design and mechanism of the proposed framework, and also presents simulation experiments to evaluate the proposed framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1165","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1165","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2380","fieldValue":"McGregor, Andrew"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2380","fieldValue":" In many data mining and machine learning problems, the data items that need to be clustered or classified are not arbitrary points in a high-dimensional space, but are distributions, that is, points on a high-dimensional simplex. For distributions, natural measures are not $&ell;_p$ distances, but information-theoretic measures such as the Kullback-Leibler and Hellinger divergences. Similarly, quantities such as the entropy of a distribution are more natural than frequency moments. Efficient estimation of these quantities is a key component in algorithms for manipulating distributions. Since the datasets involved are typically massive, these algorithms need to have only sublinear complexity in order to be feasible in practice. We present a range of sublinear-time algorithms in various oracle models in which the algorithm accesses the data via an oracle that supports various queries. In particular, we answer a question posed by Batu et al. on testing whether two distributions are close in an information-theoretic sense given independent samples. We then present optimal algorithms for estimating various information-divergences and entropy with a more powerful oracle called the combined oracle that was also considered by Batu et al. Finally, we consider sublinear-space algorithms for these quantities in the data-stream model. In the course of doing so, we explore the relationship between the aforementioned oracle models and the data-stream model. This continues work initiated by Feigenbaum et al. An important additional component to the study is considering data streams that are ordered randomly rather than just those which are ordered adversarially."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2380","fieldValue":"ACM"}
