To realize effective Web content delivery for users, two kinds of application-level QoS policies, transmission time and transmission order of inline objects, are introduced. Next, we define a language to specify these policies. We show that transmission order control can be implemented using HTTP\/1.1 pipelined requests in which a client recognizes the transmission order description in a Web page and simulates parallel transmission of inline objects by HTTP\/1.1 range requests. Experimental results show that our proposed mechanism realizes effective content delivery to a diverse group of Internet users. Finally, we introduce two methods to specify application-level QoS policies, one by content authors, and the other by end users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24324","fieldValue":" Despite the growth in multimedia, there have been few studies that focus on characterizing streaming audio and video stored on the Web. This investigation used a customized Web crawler to traverse 17 million Web pages from diverse geographic locations and identify nearly 30,000 streaming audio and video clips available for analysis. Using custom-built extraction tools, these streaming media objects were analyzed to determine attributes such as media type, encoding format, playout duration, bitrate, resolution, and codec. The streaming media content encountered is dominated by proprietary audio and video formats with the top four commercial products being RealPlayer, Windows Media Player, MP3 and QuickTime. The distribution of the stored playout durations of streaming audio and video clips are long-tailed. More than half of the streaming media clips encountered are video, encoded primarily for broadband connections and at resolutions considerably smaller than the resolutions of typical monitors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24325","fieldValue":" A Portlet is a multistep, user-facing application delivered through a Web application (e.g., a portal). OASIS approved standard, WSRP, is an attempt to standardize the interface between the provider and the consumer of the Portlet. This initiative promotes Portlet interoperability, componentware practices, and the existence of a Portlet market. This work argues that the diversity of the settings where a Portlet might be syndicated recommends that Portlets be instrumented for variability, and this, in turn, demands a product-line approach. This work introduces a new source of variability, the â\u20ACœinteraction lifecycleâ\u20AC?, a description of the visible flow of a Portlet, and shows how this feature can be adapted to cater to the idiosyncrasies of the hosting application. Distinct variants are identified that permit the consumer to customize the presentation, content, and links of the Portlet markup in a controlled way. The use of product-line techniques allow the consumer to cope with this variability in a cost-effective manner. The article ends by illustrating how the extensible capabilities of WSRP are used to accomodate this process."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24325","fieldValue":"ACM"}
