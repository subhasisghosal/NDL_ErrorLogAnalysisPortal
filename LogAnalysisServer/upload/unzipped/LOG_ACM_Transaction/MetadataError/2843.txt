The global error (GE) of a numerical solution to a BVODE is the amount by which the numerical solution differs from the exact solution. The defect is the amount by which the numerical solution fails to satisfy the ODEs and boundary conditions. Although GE control is often familiar to users, the defect controlled numerical solution can be interpreted as the exact solution to a perturbation of the original BVODE. Software packages based on GE control and on defect control are in wide use. The defect control solver, BVP_SOLVER, can provide an a posteriori estimate of the GE using Richardson extrapolation. In this article, we consider three more strategies for GE estimation based on (i) the direct use of a higher-order discretization formula (HO), (ii) the use of a higher-order discretization formula within a deferred correction (DC) framework, and (iii) the product of an estimate of the maximum defect and an estimate of the BVODE conditioning constant, and demonstrate that the HO and DC approaches have superior performance. We also modify BVP_SOLVER to introduce GE control."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19345","fieldValue":" This article proposes a type of pseudorandom number generator, Mersenne Twister for Graphic Processor (MTGP), for efficient generation on graphic processessing units (GPUs). MTGP supports large state sizes such as 11213 bits, and uses the high parallelism of GPUs in computing many steps of the recursion in parallel. The second proposal is a parameter-set generator for MTGP, named MTGP Dynamic Creator (MTGPDC). MTGPDC creates up to $2^32$ distinct parameter sets which generate sequences with high-dimensional uniformity. This facility is suitable for a large grid of GPUs where each GPU requires separate random number streams. MTGP is based on linear recursion over the two-element field, and has better high-dimensional equidistribution than the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator."}
