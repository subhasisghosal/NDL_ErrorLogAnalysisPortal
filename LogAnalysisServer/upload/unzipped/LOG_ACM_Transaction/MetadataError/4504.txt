This challenge is about enabling services actuated by IoT devices to be delivered spontaneously from the perspective of users. To accomplish this goal, we propose the Service-Oriented Internet of Things (SoIoT), a user-centric IoT-based service framework, which integrates services that utilize IoT resources in an urban computing environment. This framework provides a task-oriented computing approach that enables the composition of IoT-based services in a spontaneous manner to accomplish a user task. Tasks can also be recommended to users based on the available IoT resources in an environment and on the contextual knowledge that is represented and managed in social, spatial, and temporal aspects. These tasks are then bound to a set of service instances and performed in a distributed manner. This final composition ensures the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the tasks and is assigned to multiple client devices for the efficient utilization of IoT resources. We prove the practicality of our approach by showing a real-case service scenario implemented in our IoT-based test-bed as well as experimental results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24519","fieldValue":"Ngu, Anne H H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24519","fieldValue":" The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) bridges the gap between the physical and the digital worlds, which enables a deeper understanding of user preferences and behaviors. The rich interactions and relations between users and things call for effective and efficient recommendation approaches to better meet usersâ\u20AC™ interests and needs. In this article, we focus on the problem of things recommendation in IoT, which is important for many applications such as e-Commerce and health care. We discuss the new properties of recommending things of interest in IoT, and propose a unified probabilistic factor based framework by fusing relations across heterogeneous entities of IoT, for example, user-thing relations, user-user relations, and thing-thing relations, to make more accurate recommendations. Specifically, we develop a hypergraph to model thingsâ\u20AC™ spatiotemporal correlations, on top of which implicit things correlations can be generated. We have built an IoT testbed to validate our approach and the experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness."}
