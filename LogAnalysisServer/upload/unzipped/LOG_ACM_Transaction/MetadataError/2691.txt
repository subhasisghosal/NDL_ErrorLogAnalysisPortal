A key issue is to profile algorithms in terms of the qualitative characteristics of benchmark problems. In this methodological note, we adapt a novel all-pairs algorithm for the profiling task; given performance rankings for m algorithms on n problem instances, each described with p features, identify a (minimal) subset of p that is useful for assessing the selective superiority of an algorithm over another, for all pairs of m algorithms. We show how techniques presented in the mathematical software literature are inadequate for such profiling purposes. In conclusion, we also address various statistical issues underlying the effective application of this technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18989","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18989","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18990","fieldValue":" We develop an algorithmic framework for reducing the bandwidth of symmetric matrices via orthogonal similarity transformations. This framework includes the reduction of full matrices to banded or tridiagonal form and the reduction of banded matrices to narrower banded or tridiagonal form, possibly in multiple steps. Our framework leads to algorithms that require fewer floating-point operations than do standard algorithms, if only the eigenvalues are required. In addition, it allows for space-time tradeoffs and enables or increases the use of blocked transformations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18991","fieldValue":" We present a software toolbox for symmetric band reduction via orthogonal transformations, together with a testing and timing program. The toolbox contains drivers and computational routines for the reduction of full symmetric matrices to banded form and the reduction of banded matrices to narrower banded or tridiagonal form, with optional accumulation of the orthogonal transformations, as well as repacking routines for storage rearrangement. The functionality and the calling sequences of the routines are described, with a detailed discussion of the â\u20ACœcontrolâ\u20AC? parameters that allow adaptation of the codes to particular machine and matrix characteristics. We also briefly describe the testing and timing program included in the toolbox."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18991","fieldValue":"ACM"}
