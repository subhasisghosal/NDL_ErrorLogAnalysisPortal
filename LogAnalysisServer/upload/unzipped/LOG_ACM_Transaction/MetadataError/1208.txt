{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14603","fieldValue":" Recent work [Ives et al. 2005] proposed a new class of systems for supporting data sharing among scientific and other collaborations: this new collaborative data sharing system connects heterogeneous logical peers using a network of schema mappings. Each peer has a locally controlled and edited database instance, but wants to incorporate related data from other peers as well. To achieve this, every peer's data and updates propagate along the mappings to the other peers. However, this operation, termed update exchange, is filtered by trust conditionsâ\u20AC\u201Dexpressing what data and sources a peer judges to be authoritativeâ\u20AC\u201Dwhich may cause a peer to reject another's updates. In order to support such filtering, updates carry provenance information. This article develops methods for realizing such systems: we build upon techniques from data integration, data exchange, incremental view maintenance, and view update to propagate updates along mappings, both to derived and optionally to source instances. We incorporate a novel model for tracking data provenance, such that curators may filter updates based on trust conditions over this provenance. We implement our techniques in a layer above an off-the-shelf RDBMS, and we experimentally demonstrate the viability of these techniques in the Orchestra prototype system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14603","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14603","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2389","fieldValue":"Fernndez-Baca, David"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2389","fieldValue":" Efficient sensitivity analysis algorithms are presented for two problems arising in the study of Markov models of sequence evolution: ancestral reconstruction in evolutionary trees and local ungapped alignment under log-odds scoring. The algorithms generate complete descriptions of the optimum solutions for all possible values of the evolutionary distance. The running time for the parametric ancestral reconstruction problem under the Kimura 2-parameter model is O(kn + $kn^2\/3 log k), where n is the number of sequences and k is their length, assuming all edges have the same length. For the parametric gapless alignment problem under the Jukes-Cantor model, the running time is O(mn + mn2\/3$ log m), where m and n are the sequence lengths and n â\u2030¤ m."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14604","fieldValue":"zsoyolu, Z.
