Although data-driven statistical approaches are of most interest, there have been attempts of using rule-based methods for DST, due to their simplicity, efficiency and portability. However, the performance of these methods are usually not competitive to data-driven tracking approaches and it is not possible to improve the DST performance when training data are available. In this paper, a novel hybrid framework, constrained Markov Bayesian polynomial (CMBP), is proposed to formulate rule-based DST in a general way and allow data-driven rule generation. Here, a DST rule is defined as a polynomial function of a set of probabilities satisfying certain linear constraints. Prior knowledge is encoded in these constraints. Under reasonable assumptions, CMBP optimization can be converted to a constrained integer linear programming problem. The integer coefficient CMBP model is further extended to CMBP with real coefficients by applying grid search. CMBP was evaluated on the data corpora of the first, the second, and the third Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC-1\/2\/3). Experiments showed that CMBP has good generalization ability and can significantly outperform both traditional rule-based approaches and data-driven statistical approaches with similar feature set. Compared with the state-of-the-art statistical DST approaches with much richer features, CMBP is also competitive."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3858","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3858","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3859","fieldValue":" This paper presents spatially robust far-field microphone beamformers and nullformers derived using the von Mises and von Mises-Fisher distributions to model the expected direction of arrival. Simple analytic expressions are presented for 2D and 3D far-field correlation functions and used to design spatially robust beamformers and nullformers. It is demonstrated that the spatially robust beamformers show a modest improvement in tolerating uncertainty in the target direction of arrival without incurring a significant penalty in terms of SINR performance compared with the MVDR beamformer. In addition, the spatially robust formulation shows significantly improved numerical robustness, indicating improved ability in tolerating intrinsic array errors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3860","fieldValue":" Algorithms for the automatic detection and recognition of acoustic events are increasingly gaining relevance for the reliable and robust functioning of consumer, assistive and monitoring systems. The extraction of appropriate task relevant acoustic features from the raw sound signal clearly influences performance of subsequent statistical classification, in particular in adverse acoustic situations. The present contribution investigates the use of biologically-inspired features, derived from a filter-bank of two-dimensional Gabor functions, that decompose the spectro-temporal power density into components which capture spectral, temporal and joint spectro-temporal modulation patterns. It is hypothesized that the comparably large joint spectral and temporal extent of these Gabor functions results in features that allow for robust classification. Evaluation of the proposed feature extraction scheme together with an hidden Markov model (HMM) classifier is conducted on two corpora comprising acoustic events in realistic adverse conditions from the D-CASE and CLEAR'07 evaluation campaigns. Relevance of each Gabor filter for classification is analyzed and an optimized parameter set for the Gabor filterbank (GFB) is identified. Performance of the optimized GFB is evaluated in comparison to other state-of-the-art algorithms on isolated event classification and on the full acoustic event detection (AED) including joint classification and temporal segmentation of events. Results show that Gabor features result in a signal representation that exhibits separated average class-specific patterns. An improvement in classification accuracy of up to 26% relative to the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) baseline is obtained with the optimized GFB. Further experiments demonstrate that this improvement cannot be explained by purely temporal or purely spectral Gabor basis functions. Rather, a GFB with features extending in joint spectro-temporal directions is required to obtain optimum performance. Performance on AED with the D-CASE challenge dataset is shown to improve on previous algorithms from the recent literature."}
