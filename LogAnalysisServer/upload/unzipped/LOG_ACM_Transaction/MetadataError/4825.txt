{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25501","fieldValue":" Current mobile pay-TV systems have two types of Conditional Access Systems (CAS): group-key-based and public-key systems. The best feature of group-key-based systems is the ability to enjoy the broadcast nature in delivery multimedia contents, while the major advantage of public-key systems is consolidating the security foundation to withstand various attacks, such as collusion attacks. However, the problems of group-key-based systems include collusion attacks, lack of nonrepudiation, and troublesome key distribution. Even worse, the benefit of broadcast efficiency is confined to a group size of no more than 512 subscribers. For public-key systems, the poor delivery scalability is the major shortcoming because the unique private key feature is only suitable for one-to-one delivery. In this article, we introduce a scalable access control scheme to integrate the merits of broadcasting regardless of group size and sound security assurance, including fine-grained access control and collusion attack resistance. For subscriber revocation, a single message is broadcast to the other subscribers to get the updated key, thus significantly boosting subscriber revocation scalability. Due to mobile subscribers' dynamic movements, this article also analyzes the benefit of retransmission cases in our system. Through the performance evaluation and functionality comparison, the proposed scheme should be a decent candidate to enhance the security strength and transmission efficiency in a mobile pay-TV system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25501","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25501","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25502","fieldValue":" In general reversible watermarking algorithms, the convention is to reject the entire cover image at the receiver end if it fails authentication, since there is no way to detect the exact locations of tampering. This feature may be exploited by an adversary to bring about a form of DoS attack. Here we provide a solution to this problem in form of a tamper localization mechanism for reversible watermarking algorithms, which allows selective rejection of distorted cover image regions in case of authentication failure, thus avoiding rejection of the complete image. Additionally it minimizes the bandwidth requirement of the communication channel."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25503","fieldValue":" Enjoyment of audio has now become about flexibility and personal freedom. Digital audio content can be acquired from many sources and wireless networking allows digital media devices and associated peripherals to be unencumbered by wires. However, despite recent improvements in capacity and quality of service, wireless networks are inherently unreliable communications channels for the streaming of audio, being susceptible to the effects of range, interference, and occlusion. This time-varying reliability of wireless audio transfer introduces data corruption and loss, with unpleasant audible effects that can be profound and prolonged in duration. Traditional communications techniques for error mitigation perform poorly and in a bandwidth inefficient manner in the presence of such large-scale defects in a digital audio stream. A novel solution that can complement existing techniques takes account of the semantics and natural repetition of music. Through the use of self-similarity metadata, missing or damaged audio segments can be seamlessly replaced with similar undamaged segments that have already been successfully received. We propose a technology to generate relevant self-similarity metadata for arbitrary audio material and to utilize this metadata within a wireless audio receiver to provide sophisticated and real-time correction of large-scale errors. The primary objectives are to match the current section of a song being received with previous sections while identifying incomplete sections and determining replacements based on previously received portions of the song. This article outlines our approach to Forward Error Correction (FEC) technology that is used to â\u20ACœrepairâ\u20AC? a bursty dropout when listening to time-dependent media on a wireless network. Using self-similarity analysis on a music file, we can â\u20ACœautomaticallyâ\u20AC? repair the dropout with a similar portion of the music already received thereby minimizing a listener's discomfort."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25504","fieldValue":"Ho, Edmond S L"}
