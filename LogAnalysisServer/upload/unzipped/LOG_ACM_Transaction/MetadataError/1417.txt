We capture this phenomena by simulating the motion of particles in a fluid dynamics generated velocity field. A novel aspect of this paper is the creation of highly detailed three-dimensional turbulent velocity fields at interactive rates using a low to moderate amount of memory. The key idea is the combination of two-dimensional high resolution physically based flow fields with a moderate sized three-dimensional Kolmogorov velocity field tiled periodically in space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15356","fieldValue":"ACM"}
