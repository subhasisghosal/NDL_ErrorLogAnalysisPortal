However, the resulting service guarantees are only relative, in the sense that guarantees given to a flow class at any time are expressed with reference to the service given to other flow classes. While it is, in principle, not feasible to provision for absolute guarantees (i.e., to assure lower bounds on service metrics at all times) without admission control and\/or traffic policing, we will show in this paper that such a service can be reasonably well emulated using adaptive rate allocation and dropping mechanisms at the link schedulers of routers. We name the resulting type of guarantees best-effort bounds. We propose mechanisms for link schedulers of routers that achieve these and other guarantees by adjusting the drop rates and the service rate allocations of traffic classes to current load conditions. The mechanisms are rooted in control theory and employ adaptive feedback loops. We demonstrate that these mechanisms can realize many recently proposed approaches to class-based service differentiation. The effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms are evaluated in measurement experiments of a kernel-level implementation in FreeBSD PC-routers with multiple 100 Mbps Ethernet interfaces, complemented with simulations of larger scale networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9623","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9623","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9623","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1869","fieldValue":" As microprocessor designs integrate more cores, scalability of cache coherence protocols becomes a challenging problem. Most directory-based protocols avoid races by using blocking tag directories that can impact the performance of parallel applications. In this article, we first quantitatively demonstrate that state-of-the-art blocking protocols significantly constrain throughput at large core counts for several parallel applications. Nonblocking protocols address this throughput concern at the expense of scalability in the interconnection network or in the required resource overheads. To address this concern, we enhance nonblocking directory protocols by migrating the point of service of responses. Our approach uses in-flight chains of cores making parallel memory requests to incorporate scalability while maintaining high-throughput. The proposed cache coherence protocol called chained cache coherence, can outperform blocking protocols by up to 20&percnt; on scientific and 12&percnt; on commercial applications. It also has low resource overheads and simple address ordering requirements making it both a high-performance and scalable protocol. Furthermore, in-flight chains provide a scalable solution to building hierarchical and nonblocking tag directories as well as optimize communication latencies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1869","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1869","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9624","fieldValue":" Network providers are often interested in providing dynamically provisioned bandwidth to customers based on periodically measured nonstationary traffic while meeting service level agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we propose a dynamic bandwidth provisioning framework for such a situation. In order to have a good sense of nonstationary periodically measured traffic data, measurements were first collected over a period of three weeks excluding the weekends in three different months from an Internet access link. To characterize the traffic data rate dynamics of these data sets, we develop a seasonal AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) based model with the innovation process (disturbances) generalized to the class of heavy-tailed distributions. We observed a strong empirical evidence for the proposed model. Based on the ARCH-model, we present a probability-hop forecasting algorithm, an augmented forecast mechanism using the confidence-bounds of the mean forecast value from the conditional forecast distribution. For bandwidth estimation, we present different bandwidth provisioning schemes that allocate or deallocate the bandwidth based on the traffic forecast generated by our forecasting algorithm. These provisioning schemes are developed to allow trade off between the underprovisioning and the utilization, while addressing the overhead cost of updating bandwidth. Based on extensive studies with three different data sets, we have found that our approach provides a robust dynamic bandwidth provisioning framework for real-world periodically measured nonstationary traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9624","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
