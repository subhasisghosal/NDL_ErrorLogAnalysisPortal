{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16003","fieldValue":" We introduce a novel representation for random-access rendering of antialiased vector graphics on the GPU, along with efficient encoding and rendering algorithms. The representation supports a broad class of vector primitives, including multiple layers of semitransparent filled and stroked shapes, with quadratic outlines and color gradients. Our approach is to create a coarse lattice in which each cell contains a variable-length encoding of the graphics primitives it overlaps. These cell-specialized encodings are interpreted at runtime within a pixel shader. Advantages include localized memory access and the ability to map vector graphics onto arbitrary surfaces, or under arbitrary deformations. Most importantly, we perform both prefiltering and supersampling within a single pixel shader invocation, achieving inter-primitive antialiasing at no added memory bandwidth cost. We present an efficient encoding algorithm, and demonstrate high-quality real-time rendering of complex, real-world examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16004","fieldValue":"Tai, Yu-Wing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16004","fieldValue":"Tang, Chi-Keung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16004","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16004","fieldValue":" Constrained parameterization is an effective way to establish texture coordinates between a 3D surface and an existing image or photograph. A known drawback to constrained parameterization is visual distortion that arises when the 3D geometry is mismatched to highly textured image regions. This paper introduces an approach to reduce visual distortion by expanding image regions via texture synthesis to better fit the 3D geometry. The result is a new amended texture that maintains the essence of the input texture image but exhibits significantly less distortion when mapped onto the 3D model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16004","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16004","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16005","fieldValue":" Preserving details from a high resolution reference model onto lower resolution models is a complex, and sometimes daunting, task as manual intervention is required to correct texture misplacements. Inverse Geometric Textures (IGT) is a parameterization-independent texturing technique that allows preservation of texture details from a high resolution reference model onto lower resolutions, generated with any given simplification method. IGT uses a parameterization defined on the reference model to generate an inversely parameterized texture that stores, for each texel, a list with information about all the triangles mapped onto it. In this way, for any valid texture coordinate, IGT can identify the point and the triangle of the detailed model that was projected, allowing details from the reference model to be applied onto the fragment from the low-resolution model. IGT is encoded in compact data structures and can be evaluated quickly. Furthermore, the high resolution model can have its own independent artist-provided, unmodified parameterization, so that no additional effort is required to directly use artist-designed content."}
