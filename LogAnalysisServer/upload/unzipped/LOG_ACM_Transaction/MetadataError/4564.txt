HASE allows rapid development and exploration of computer architectures at multiple levels of abstraction, encompassing both hardware and software. It has five modes of operation (Design, Model Validation, Build Simulation, Simulate System, and Experiment) which formalize the design cycle and allow a proper separation of concerns among the different phases of simulation activity. The software of HASE itself includes a project data storage facility, a discrete-event simulation engine, graphical display\/ editing mechanisms, a visualization mechanism, and tools for setting up experiments and gathering results. HASE has been used in a number of research and student projects and these exemplify many of the interesting features of HASE and their relation to designing, simulating and evaluating scalable systems. They include the modeling of scalable implementations of the hierarchical PRAM model of parallel computation on a 2-D mesh, the evaluation of the performance of multiprocessor interconnection networks, and a model of the Stanford DASH architecture."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24800","fieldValue":"HASE"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24800","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24800","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24801","fieldValue":" Procedures for multiple comparisons with the best are investigated in the context of steady-state simulation, whereby a number k of different systems (stochastic processes) are compared based upon their (asymptotic) means Î¼i (i = 1,2,â\u20AC¦, k). The variances of these (asymptotically stationary) processes are assumed to be unknown and possibly unequal. We consider the problem of constructing simultaneous confidence intervals for mi-max jâ\u2030 imj i=1,2,&ldots;,k which is known as multiple comparisons with the best (MCB). Our intervals are constrained to contain 0, and so are called constrained MCB intervals. In particular, two-stage procedures for construction of absolute- and relative-width confidence intervals are presented. Their validity is addressed by showing that the confidence intervals cover the parameters with probability of at least some user-specified threshold value, as the confidence intervals' width parameter shrinks to 0. The general assumption about the processes is that they satisfy a functional central limit theorem. The simulation output analysis procedures are based on the method of standardized time series (the batch means method is a special case). The techniques developed here extend to other multiple-comparison procedures such as unconstrained MCB, multiple comparisons with a control, and all-pairwise comparisons. Although simulation is the context in this paper, the results naturally apply to (asymptotically) stationary time series."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24801","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24801","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3397","fieldValue":" In 1958, JJ Gibson put forward proposals on the visual control of locomotion. Research in the last 50 years has served to clarify the sources of visual and nonvisual information that contribute to successful steering, but has yet to determine how this information is optimally combined under conditions of uncertainty. Here, we test the conditions under which a locomotor robot with a mobile camera can steer effectively using simple visual and extra-retinal parameters to examine how such models cope with the noisy real-world visual and motor estimates that are available to humans. This applied modeling gives us an insight into both the advantages and limitations of using active gaze to sample information when steering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3397","fieldValue":"ACM"}
