The MSS method computes the minimizer of a quadratic function defined by a limited-memory BFGS matrix subject to a two-norm trust-region constraint. This solver is an adaptation of the Moré-Sorensen direct method into an L-BFGS setting for large-scale optimization. The MSS method makes use of a recently proposed stable fast direct method for solving large shifted BFGS systems of equations [Erway and Marcia 2012; Erway et al. 2012] and is able to compute solutions to any user-defined accuracy. This MATLAB implementation is a matrix-free iterative method for large-scale optimization. Numerical experiments on the CUTEr [Bongartz et al. 1995; Gould et al. 2003]) suggest that using the MSS method as a trust-region subproblem solver can require significantly fewer function and gradient evaluations needed by a trust-region method as compared with the Steihaug-Toint method."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19389","fieldValue":"L-BFGS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2875","fieldValue":" We report on Korean monolingual, Chinese-Korean English-as-pivot bilingual, and Chinese-English bilingual CLIR experiments using MT software augmented with Web-based entity-oriented translation as resources in the NTCIR-4 environment. Simple stemming is helpful in improving bigram indexing for Korean retrieval. For word indexing, keeping nouns only is preferable. Web-based translation reduces untranslated terms left over after MT and substantially improves CLIR results. Translation concatenation is found to consistently improve CLIR effectiveness, while combining a retrieval list from bigram and word indexing is also helpful. A method to disambiguate multiple MT outputs using a log likelihood ratio threshold was tested. Depending on the nature of the title or description queries, bigram only or a retrieval combination, or relaxed or rigid evaluations, direct bilingual CLIR returned an average precision of 71--79&percnt; (English-Korean) and 76--84&percnt; (Chinese-English) of the corresponding Korean-Korean and English-English monolingual results. Using English as a pivot in Chinese-Korean CLIR provides about 55--65&percnt; the effectiveness that Korean alone does. Entity\/terminology translation at the pivot language stage accounts for a large portion of this deficiency. A topic with comparatively worse Chinese-English bilingual result does not necessarily mean that it will continue to under-perform (after further transitive Korean translation) at the Korean retrieval level."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2875","fieldValue":"Rich results from poor resources: NTCIR-4 monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval of korean texts using chinese and english"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2875","fieldValue":"ACM"}
