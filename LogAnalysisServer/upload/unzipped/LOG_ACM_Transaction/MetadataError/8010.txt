Past work has focused on one of two models. First, design the network for the known point-to-point peak demands. Second, design the network to support all hose matrices (all matrices not exceeding marginal bounds at the nodes). Both models may be too conservative if additional information on traffic patterns is available. We introduce a capped hose model to explore a range of traffic scenarios, which includes the above two as special cases. It is known that optimal network designs for the hose model are always determined by single-hub routing, and for the fixed-demand model are based on shortest-path routing. We demonstrate that a wider variety of routing templates is required to address the broader spectrum of capped hose matrices. We propose the use of hierarchical multihub routing templates, a generalization of hub and tree routing. Our empirical analysis is based on a heuristic for the resulting robust network design problem. These lead to two important findings: 1) designs based on multihub routing are often preferable to both hub and shortest path; 2) it may be possible for a carrier to sample their traffic in order to determine which type of routing is most cost-effective for their network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10840","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10840","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10840","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10841","fieldValue":" Poor visibility into the network hampers progress in a number of important research areas, from network troubleshooting to Internet topology and performance mapping. This persistent, well-known problem has served as motivation for numerous proposals to build or extend existing Internet measurement platforms by recruiting larger, more diverse vantage points. Capturing the edge of the network, however, remains an elusive goal. We argue that at its root the problem is one of incentives. Today's measurement platforms build on the assumption that the goals of experimenters and those hosting the platform are the same. As much of the Internet growth occurs in residential broadband networks, this assumption no longer holds. We present a measurement experimentation platform that reaches the network edge by explicitly aligning the objectives of the experimenters with those of the users hosting the platform. Dasu---our current prototype---is designed to support both network measurement experimentation and broadband characterization. Dasu has been publicly available since July 2010 and has been installed by over 100 000 users with a heterogeneous set of connections spreading across 2431 autonomous systems (ASs) and 166 countries. We discuss some of the challenges we faced building and using a platform for the Internet's edge, describe its design and implementation, and illustrate the unique perspective its current deployment brings to Internet measurement."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10841","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10841","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10841","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10842","fieldValue":" Intradomain traffic engineering (TE) has become an indispensable tool for Internet service providers (ISPs) to optimize network performance and utilize network resources efficiently. Various explicit routing TE methods were recently proposed and have been able to achieve high network performance. However, explicit routing has high complexity and requires large ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) in the routers. Moreover, it is costly to deploy explicit routing in IP networks. In this paper, we present an approach, called generalized destination-based multipath routing (GDMR), to achieve the same high performance as explicit routing. The main contribution of this paper is that we prove that an arbitrary explicit routing can be converted to a loop-free destination-based routing without any performance penalty for a given traffic matrix. We present a systematic approach including a heuristic algorithm to realize GDMR. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of GDMR."}
