However, only a limited number of methodologies refers to how to move from a conceptual model to an executable simulation model. Besides, existing M&S methodologies do not typically provide a formal method for model transformations between the models in different stages of the development process. Hence, in the current M&S practice, model continuity is usually not fulfilled. In this article, a model-driven development framework for M&S is presented to bridge the gap between different stages of a simulation study and to obtain model continuity. The applicability of the framework is illustrated with a prototype modeling environment and a case study in the discrete event simulation domain."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25127","fieldValue":"Model Continuity in Discrete Event Simulation: A Framework for Model-Driven Development of Simulation Models"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25127","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25127","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25128","fieldValue":" Model calibration and validation are important processes in the development of stochastic computer models of real complex systems. This article introduces an integrated approach for model calibration, validation, and prediction based on Gaussian process metamodels and a Bayesian approach. Within this integrated approach, a sequential approach is further proposed for stochastic computer model calibration. Several design criteria for this sequential stage are proposed and studied, including an entropy-based criterion and one based on minimizing prediction error. To further use the data resources to improve the performance of both calibration and prediction, an adaptive procedure that combines these criteria is introduced to balance the resource allocation between the calibration and prediction. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed sequential calibration approach and the integrated approach are illustrated with several numerical examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25128","fieldValue":"Calibration, Validation, and Prediction in Random Simulation Models: Gaussian Process Metamodels and a Bayesian Integrated Solution"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25128","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25128","fieldValue":"ACM"}
