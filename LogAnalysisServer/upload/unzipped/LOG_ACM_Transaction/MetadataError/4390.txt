The basic idea is to allow users to rate each other even without being direct neighbours. In this case, the purpose is to derive a trust score for a given user, which could be of help to decide whether to trust other users or not. In this article, we investigate the properties of trust propagation within social networks, based on the notion of transitivity, and we introduce the TISoN model to generate and evaluate Trust Inference within online Social Networks. To do so, (i) we develop a novel TPS algorithm for Trust Path Searching where we define neighboursâ\u20AC™ priority based on their direct trust degrees, and then select trusted paths while controlling the path length; and, (ii) we develop different TIM algorithms for Trust Inference Measuring and build a trust network. In addition, we analyse existing algorithms and we demonstrate that our proposed model better computes transitive trust values than do the existing models. We conduct extensive experiments on a real online social network dataset, Advogato. Experimental results show that our work is scalable and generates better results than do the pioneering approaches of the literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24150","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24150","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24151","fieldValue":" Online social networks have become an effective and important social platform for communication, opinions exchange, and information sharing. However, they also make it possible for rapid and wide misinformation diffusion, which may lead to pernicious influences on individuals or society. Hence, it is extremely important and necessary to detect the misinformation propagation by placing monitors. In this article, we first define a general misinformation-detection problem for the case where the knowledge about misinformation sources is lacking, and show its equivalence to the influence-maximization problem in the reverse graph. Furthermore, considering node vulnerability, we aim to detect the misinformation reaching to a specific user. Therefore, we study a Ï\u201E-Monitor Placement problem for cases where partial knowledge of misinformation sources is available and prove its #P complexity. We formulate a corresponding integer program, tackle exponential constraints, and propose a Minimum Monitor Set Construction (MMSC) algorithm, in which the $cut-set^2$ has been exploited in the estimation of reachability of node pairs. Moreover, we generalize the problem from a single target to multiple central nodes and propose another algorithm based on a Monte Carlo sampling technique. Extensive experiments on real-world networks show the effectiveness of proposed algorithms with respect to minimizing the number of monitors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24151","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24151","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3347","fieldValue":" Visual perception is an inherently selective process. To understand when and why a particular region of a scene is selected, it is imperative to observe and describe the eye movements of individuals as they go about performing specific tasks. In this sense, vision is an active process that integrates scene properties with specific, goal-oriented oculomotor behavior. This study is an investigation of how task influences the visual selection of stimuli from a scene. Four eye tracking experiments were designed and conducted to determine how everyday tasks affect oculomotor behavior. A portable eyetracker was created for the specific purpose of bringing the experiments out of the laboratory and into the real world, where natural behavior is most likely to occur. The experiments provide evidence that the human visual system is not a passive collector of salient environemental stimuli, nor is vision general-purpose. Rather, vision is active and specific, tightly coupled to the requirements of a task and a plan of action. The experiments support the hypothesis that the purpose of selective attention is to maximize task efficiency by fixating relevant objects in the scene. A computational model of visual attention is presented that imposes a high-level constraint on the bottom-up salient properties of a scene for the purpose of locating regions that are likely to correspond to foreground objects rather than background or other salient nonobject stimuli. In addition to improving the correlation to human subject fixation densities over a strictly bottom-up model [Itti et al. 1998; Parkhurst et al. 2002], this model predicts a central fixation tendency when that tendency is warranted, and not as an artificially primed location bias."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24152","fieldValue":" The task of query performance prediction is to estimate the effectiveness of search performed in response to a query when no relevance judgments are available. We present a novel probabilistic analysis of the performance prediction task. The analysis gives rise to a general prediction framework that uses pseudo-effective or ineffective document lists that are retrieved in response to the query. These lists serve as reference to the result list at hand, the effectiveness of which we want to predict. We show that many previously proposed prediction methods can be explained using our framework. More generally, we shed new light on existing prediction methods and establish formal common grounds to seemingly different prediction approaches. In addition, we formally demonstrate the connection between prediction using reference lists and fusion of retrieved lists, and provide empirical support to this connection. Through an extensive empirical exploration, we study various factors that affect the quality of prediction using reference lists."}
