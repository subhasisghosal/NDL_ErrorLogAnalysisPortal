The method facilitates concurrent program design by separating the concerns of correctness from those of hardware and implementation. It uses predicate transformer semantics to define a set of basic operators for the specification and verification of programs. From an initial specification program development proceeds by a series of refinement steps, each of which constitutes a strengthening of the specification of the previous refinement. The method is completely formal in the sense that all reasoning steps are performed within predicate calculus. A program is viewed as a mathematical object enjoying certain properties, rather than in terms of its possible executions. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by deriving an efficient algorithm for the Maximum Flow Problem in a top-down manner."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20113","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20113","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2925","fieldValue":" In this paper, we address the problem of skewed data in topic tracking: the small number of stories labeled positive as compared to negative stories and propose a method for estimating effective training stories for the topic-tracking task. For a small number of labeled positive stories, we use bilingual comparable, i.e., English, and Japanese corpora, together with the EDR bilingual dictionary, and extract story pairs consisting of positive and associated stories. To overcome the problem of a large number of labeled negative stories, we classified them into clusters. This is done using a semisupervised clustering algorithm, combining k means with EM. The method was tested on the TDT English corpus and the results showed that the system works well when the topic under tracking is talking about an event originating in the source language country, even for a small number of initial positive training stories."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20114","fieldValue":" A new approach to goal-oriented programming is described, whereby the search for values of variables to satisfy a goal is invariably directed by that goal or by information provided by its failure. This goal-directed approach is in contrast to that employed by logic programming systems, which attempt to satisfy a goal that has failed by resatisfying an already tested goal, and which furthermore do this in a way determined solely by the order of facts and rules in the database and without reference to the goal that has failed. Proposed changes in the control structure of logic programs designed to improve their execution serve more to reduce the search space than to add goal direction. A goal-directed language that embodies the new approach is presented. It is at the same time a functional programming language and a specification interpreter for the direct execution and testing of functional specifications, and permits the user to write executable program descriptions in which some of the constituent functions are fully defined while others are â\u20ACœmerelyâ\u20AC? specified. The language has been successfully tested on examples drawn from such fields as deductive question answering and problem solving, where it compares favorably with the logic programming languages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20114","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20114","fieldValue":"ACM"}
