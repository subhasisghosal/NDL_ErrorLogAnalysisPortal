Of great concern to the user of such a system is the response time associated with issuing a query to the database. This study presents a procedure for estimating response time for one of the most frequently encountered physical storage mechanisms, the indexed file. The model provides a fairly high degree of accuracy, but is simple enough so that the cost of applying the model is not exorbitant. The model incorporates the knowledge that the distribution of access key occurrences is known to follow Zipf's law. It first estimates the access time required to complete the query, which includes the time needed for all input and output transactions, and CPU time used in performing the search. The effects of multiple users on an individual's response time are then assessed using a simple regression estimation technique. The two-step procedure allows for the separation of access time from multiuser influences."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14046","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14046","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14047","fieldValue":"Yuan, Li-Yan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14047","fieldValue":" We consider nested relations whose schemes are structured as trees, called scheme trees, and introduce a normal form for such relations, called the nested normal form. Given a set of attributes U, and a set of multivalued dependencies (MVDs) M over these attributes, we present an algorithm to obtain a nested normal form decomposition of U with respect to M. Such a decomposition has several desirable properties, such as explicitly representing a set of full and embedded MVDs implied by M, and being a faithful and nonredundant representation of U. Moreover, if the given set of MVDs is conflict-free, then the nested normal form decomposition is also dependency-preserving. Finally, we show that if M is conflict-free, then the set of root-to-leaf paths of scheme trees in nested normal form decomposition is precisely the unique 4NF decomposition [9, 16] of U with respect to M."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14048","fieldValue":" In this paper we examine the problem of object and record retrieval from optical disks. General objects (such as images, documents, etc.) may be long and their length may have high variance. We assume that all the components of an object are stored consecutively in storage to speed-up retrieval performance. We first present an optical disk model and an optimal schedule for retrieval of records and objects which qualify in a single query on a file stored on an optical disk device. We then provide exact and approximate analytic results for evaluating the retrieval performance for objects from an optical disk. The analysis provides some basic analytic tools for studying the performance of various file and database organizations for optical disks. The results involve probability distribution of block accesses, probability distributions of span accesses, and probability distribution of seek times. Record retrieval is an important special case. This analysis differs from similar ones in database environments in the following respects: (1) the large size and large variance of the size of objects; (2) crossing of track boundaries by objects; (3) the capability for span access that optical disks provide (e.g., when the optical assembly is located in a given position, information can be read from a number of consecutive tracks (span) with a small additional cost)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14048","fieldValue":"ACM"}
