Rather than using a large linear program with a quadratic number of variables, we apply the theory of optimal transportation and pass to a dual differential formulation with linear scaling. After discretization using finite elements (FEM) and development of an accompanying optimization method, we apply our new EMD to problems in graphics and geometry processing. In particular, we uncover a class of smooth distances on a surface transitioning from a purely spectral distance to the geodesic distance between points; these distances also can be extended to the volume inside and outside the surface. A number of additional applications of our machinery to geometry problems in graphics are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17060","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17060","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17061","fieldValue":" Controlling the singular values of n-dimensional matrices is often required in geometric algorithms in graphics and engineering. This paper introduces a convex framework for problems that involve singular values. Specifically, it enables the optimization of functionals and constraints expressed in terms of the extremal singular values of matrices. Towards this end, we introduce a family of convex sets of matrices whose singular values are bounded. These sets are formulated using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI), allowing optimization with standard convex Semidefinite Programming (SDP) solvers. We further show that these sets are optimal, in the sense that there exist no larger convex sets that bound singular values. A number of geometry processing problems are naturally described in terms of singular values. We employ the proposed framework to optimize and improve upon standard approaches. We experiment with this new framework in several applications: volumetric mesh deformations, extremal quasi-conformal mappings in three dimensions, non-rigid shape registration and averaging of rotations. We show that in all applications the proposed approach leads to algorithms that compare favorably to state-of-art algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17062","fieldValue":" This paper introduces an algorithm for computing low-distortion, bijective mappings between surface meshes. The algorithm recieves as input a coarse set of corresponding pairs of points on the two surfaces, and follows three steps: (i) cutting the two meshes to disks in a consistent manner; (ii) jointly flattening the two disks via a novel formulation for minimizing isometric distortion while guaranteeing local injectivity (the flattenings can overlap, however); and (iii) computing a unique continuous bijection that is consistent with the flattenings. The construction of the algorithm stems from two novel observations: first, bijections between disk-type surfaces can be uniquely and efficiently represented via consistent locally injective flattenings that are allowed to be globally overlapping. This observation reduces the problem of computing bijective surface mappings to the task of computing locally injective flattenings, which is shown to be easier. Second, locally injective flattenings that minimize isometric distortion can be efficiently characterized and optimized in a convex framework. Experiments that map a wide baseline of pairs of surface meshes using the algorithm are provided. They demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to produce high-quality continuous bijective mappings between pairs of surfaces of varying isometric distortion levels."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17063","fieldValue":" We solve the form-finding problem for polyhedral meshes in a way which combines form, function and fabrication; taking care of user-specified constraints like boundary interpolation, planarity of faces, statics, panel size and shape, enclosed volume, and last, but not least, cost. Our main application is the interactive modeling of meshes for architectural and industrial design. Our approach can be described as guided exploration of the constraint space whose algebraic structure is simplified by introducing auxiliary variables and ensuring that constraints are at most quadratic. Computationally, we perform a projection onto the constraint space which is biased towards low values of an energy which expresses desirable \"soft\" properties like fairness. We have created a tool which elegantly handles difficult tasks, such as taking boundary-alignment of polyhedral meshes into account, planarization, fairing under planarity side conditions, handling hybrid meshes, and extending the treatment of static equilibrium to shapes which possess overhanging parts."}
