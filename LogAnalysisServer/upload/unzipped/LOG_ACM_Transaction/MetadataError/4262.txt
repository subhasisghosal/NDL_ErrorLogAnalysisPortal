We initially describe a binary string encoding for 1D relations that permits the automatic derivation of similarity measures. We then extend this model to various granularity levels and many dimensions, and show that reasoning on spatio-temporal structure is significantly facilitated in the new framework. Finally, we provide algorithms and optimization methods for four types of queries: (i) object retrieval based on some spatio-temporal relations with respect to a reference object, (ii) spatial joins, i.e., retrieval of object pairs that satisfy some input relation, (iii) structural queries, which retrieve configurations matching a particular spatio-temporal structure, and (iv) special cases of motion queries. Considering the current large availability of multidimensional data and the increasing need for flexible query-answering mechanisms, our techniques can be used as the core of spatio-temporal query processors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23829","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23829","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23830","fieldValue":" The proliferation of searchable text databases on corporate networks and the Internet causes a database selection problem for many people. Algorithms such as gGLOSS and CORI can automatically select which text databases to search for a given information need, but only if given a set of resource descriptions that accurately represent the contents of each database. The existing techniques for a acquiring resource descriptions have significant limitations when used in wide-area networks controlled by many parties. This paper presents query-based sampling, a new technicque for acquiring accurate resource descriptions. Query-based sampling does not require the cooperation of resource providers, nor does it require that resource providers use a particular search engine or representation technique. An extensive set of experimental results demonstrates that accurate resource descriptions are crated, that computation and communication costs are reasonable, and that the resource descriptions do in fact enable accurate automatic dtabase selection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23830","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23830","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23831","fieldValue":" Today, when searching for information on the WWW, one usually performs a query through a term-based search engine. These engines return, as the query's result, a list of Web pages whose contents matches the query. For broad-topic queries, such searches often result in a huge set of retrieved documents, many of which are irrelevant to the user. However, much information is contained in the link-structure of the WWW. Information such as which pages are linked to others can be used to augment search algorithms. In this context, Jon Kleinberg introduced the notion of two distinct types of Web pages: hubs and authorities. Kleinberg argued that hubs and authorities exhibit a mutually reinforcing relationship: a good hub will point to many authorities, and a good authority will be pointed at by many hubs. In light of this, he dervised an algoirthm aimed at finding authoritative pages. We present SALSA, a new stochastic approach for link-structure analysis, which examines random walks on graphs derived from the link-structure. We show that both SALSA and Kleinberg's Mutual Reinforcement approach employ the same metaalgorithm. We then prove that SALSA is quivalent to a weighted in degree analysis of the link-sturcutre of WWW subgraphs, making it computationally more efficient than the Mutual reinforcement approach. We compare that results of applying SALSA to the results derived through Kleinberg's approach. These comparisions reveal a topological Phenomenon called the TKC effectwhich, in certain cases, prevents the Mutual reinforcement approach from identifying meaningful authorities."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23831","fieldValue":"SALSA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23831","fieldValue":"ACM"}
