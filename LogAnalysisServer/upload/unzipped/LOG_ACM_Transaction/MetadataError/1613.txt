By making use of this simplification and the properties of Fourier space representation of elliptic equations, we use a common spectral method to solve both of these equations. Based on this system of equations, we propose a level set based input description which provides a flexible environment for the user to model a wide range of flows and artistic effects in 2D. This input type allows the modeling of vortex sheet patterns and other complex flows with a very practical approach and chaotic, dynamic flows, even with viscous Stokes equations. A user interface is developed for the level set input which allows the user to draw the strokes or edit the level set data by applying transformation functions or perturbations. To sum up, this model can be used for the simulation of very viscous flows, vorticity dynamics, vortex sheet patterns, turbulent and chaotic flows as well as other artistic effects such as the traditional marbling patterns, with a simple, fast and stable system at high resolutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15867","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15867","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15868","fieldValue":" This article presents a generic framework for the representation and deformation of level set surfaces at extreme resolutions. The framework is composed of two modules that each utilize optimized and application specific algorithms: 1) A fast out-of-core data management scheme that allows for resolutions of the deforming geometry limited only by the available disk space as opposed to memory, and 2) compact and fast compression strategies that reduce both offline storage requirements and online memory footprints during simulation. Out-of-core and compression techniques have been applied to a wide range of computer graphics problems in recent years, but this article is the first to apply it in the context of level set and fluid simulations. Our framework is generic and flexible in the sense that the two modules can transparently be integrated, separately or in any combination, into existing level set and fluid simulation software based on recently proposed narrow band data structures like the DT-Grid of Nielsen and Museth [2006] and the H-RLE of Houston et al [2006]. The framework can be applied to narrow band signed distances, fluid velocities, scalar fields, particle properties as well as standard graphics attributes like colors, texture coordinates, normals, displacements etc. In fact, our framework is applicable to a large body of computer graphics problems that involve sequential or random access to very large co-dimension one (level set) and zero (e.g. fluid) data sets. We demonstrate this with several applications, including fluid simulations interacting with large boundaries (&approx; $1500^3), surface deformations (&approx; 20483), the solution of partial differential equations on large surfaces (&approx; 40963) and mesh-to-level set scan conversions of resolutions up to &approx; 350003$ (7 billion voxels in the narrow band). Our out-of-core framework is shown to be several times faster than current state-of-the-art level set data structures relying on OS paging. In particular we show sustained throughput (grid points\/sec) for gigabyte sized level sets as high as 65&percnt; of state-of-the-art throughput for in-core simulations. We also demonstrate that our compression techniques out-perform state-of-the-art compression algorithms for narrow bands."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15868","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15868","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15869","fieldValue":" We explore the use of space-time cuts to smoothly transition between stochastic mesh animation clips involving numerous deformable mesh groups while subject to physical constraints. These transitions are used to construct Mesh Ensemble Motion Graphs for interactive data-driven animation of high-dimensional mesh animation datasets, such as those arising from expensive physical simulations of deformable objects blowing in the wind. We formulate the transition computation as an integer programming problem, and introduce a novel randomized algorithm to compute transitions subject to geometric nonpenetration constraints. We present examples for several physically based motion datasets, with real-time display and optional interactive control over wind intensity via transitions between wind levels. We discuss challenges and opportunities for future work and practical application."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15869","fieldValue":"ACM"}
