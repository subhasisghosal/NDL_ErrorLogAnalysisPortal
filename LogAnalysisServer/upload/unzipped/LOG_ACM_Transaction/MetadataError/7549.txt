PRESTO proxies construct time-series models of observed trends in the sensor data and transmit the parameters of the model to sensors. Sensors check sensed data with model-predicted values and transmit only deviations from the predictions back to the proxy. Such a model-driven push approach is energy-efficient, while ensuring that anomalous data trends are never missed. In addition to supporting queries on current data, PRESTO also supports queries on historical data using interpolation and local archival at sensors. PRESTO can adapt model and system parameters to data and query dynamics to further extract energy savings. We have implemented PRESTO on a sensor testbed comprising Intel Stargates and Telos Motes. Our experiments show that in a temperature monitoring application, PRESTO yields one to two orders of magnitude reduction in energy requirements over on-demand, proactive or model-driven pull approaches. PRESTO also results in an order of magnitude reduction in query latency in a 1% duty-cycled five hop sensor network over a system that forwards all queries to remote sensor nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9905","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9905","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9905","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9906","fieldValue":"McKeown, Nick"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9906","fieldValue":" This paper presents Ethane, a new network architecture for the enterprise. Ethane allows managers to define a single network-wide fine-grain policy and then enforces it directly. Ethane couples extremely simple flow-based Ethernet switches with a centralized controller that manages the admittance and routing of flows. While radical, this design is backwards-compatible with existing hosts and switches. We have implemented Ethane in both hardware and software, supporting both wired and wireless hosts.We also show that it is compatible with existing high-fanout switches by porting it to popular commodity switching chipsets. We have deployed and managed two operational Ethane networks, one in the Stanford University Computer Science Department supporting over 300 hosts, and another within a small business of 30 hosts. Our deployment experiences have significantly affected Ethane's design."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9906","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9906","fieldValue":"ACM"}
