In this paper, we address the â\u20ACœincentive issueâ\u20AC? of a cooperative proxy caching system and how to motivate each proxy to provide cache space to the system. To encourage proxies to participate, we propose a â\u20ACœrevenue-rewarding schemeâ\u20AC? to credit the cooperative proxies according to the resources they contribute. A game-theoretic model is used to analyze the interactions among proxies under the revenue-rewarding scheme. We propose two cooperative game settings that lead to optimal situations. In particular, (1) We propose a distributed incentive framework for peers to participate in resource contribution for media streaming; (2) Proxies are encouraged to cooperate under the revenue-rewarding scheme; (3) Profit and social welfare are maximized in these cooperative games; and (4) Cost-effective resource allocation is achieved in these cooperative games. Large scale simulation is carried out to validate and verify the merits of our proposed incentive schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25300","fieldValue":"A revenue-rewarding scheme of providing incentive for cooperative proxy caching for media streaming systems"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25300","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25300","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25301","fieldValue":"He, Li-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25301","fieldValue":" Remote viewing of lectures presented to a live audience is becoming increasingly popular. At the same time, the lectures can be recorded for subsequent on-demand viewing over the Internet. Providing such services, however, is often prohibitive due to the labor-intensive cost of capturing and pre\/post-processing. This article presents a complete automated end-to-end system that supports capturing, broadcasting, viewing, archiving and searching of presentations. Specifically, we describe a system architecture that minimizes the pre- and post-production time, and a fully automated lecture capture system called iCam2 that synchronously captures all contents of the lecture, including audio, video, and presentation material. No staff is needed during lecture capture and broadcasting, so the operational cost of the system is negligible. The system has been used on a daily basis for more than 4 years, during which 522 lectures have been captured. These lectures have been viewed over 20,000 times."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25302","fieldValue":" At one end of the spectrum, research in interactive content-based retrieval concentrates on machine learning methods for effective use of relevance feedback. On the other end, the information visualization community focuses on effective methods for conveying information to the user. What is lacking is research considering the information visualization and interactive retrieval as truly integrated parts of one content-based search system. In such an integrated system, there are many degrees of freedom like the similarity function, the number of images to display, the image size, different visualization modes, and possible feedback modes. To base the optimal values for all of those on user studies is unfeasible. We therefore develop search scenarios in which tasks and user actions are simulated. From there, the proposed scheme is optimized based on objective constraints and evaluation criteria. In such a manner, the degrees of freedom are reduced and the remaining degrees can be evaluated in user studies. In this article, we present a system that integrates advanced similarity based visualization with active learning. We have performed extensive experimentation on interactive category search with different image collections. The results using the proposed simulation scheme show that indeed the use of advanced visualization and active learning pays off in all of these datasets."}
