The dynamic nature of such data requires the sentiment and topic analysis model to be also dynamically updated, capturing the most recent language use of sentiments and topics in text. We propose a dynamic Joint Sentiment-Topic model (dJST) which allows the detection and tracking of views of current and recurrent interests and shifts in topic and sentiment. Both topic and sentiment dynamics are captured by assuming that the current sentiment-topic-specific word distributions are generated according to the word distributions at previous epochs. We study three different ways of accounting for such dependency information: (1) sliding window where the current sentiment-topic word distributions are dependent on the previous sentiment-topic-specific word distributions in the last S epochs; (2) skip model where history sentiment topic word distributions are considered by skipping some epochs in between; and (3) multiscale model where previous long- and short- timescale distributions are taken into consideration. We derive efficient online inference procedures to sequentially update the model with newly arrived data and show the effectiveness of our proposed model on the Mozilla add-on reviews crawled between 2007 and 2011."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7523","fieldValue":" Twitter is a popular microblogging service that acts as a ground-level information news flashes portal where people with different background, age, and social condition provide information about what is happening in front of their eyes. This characteristic makes Twitter probably the fastest information service in the world. In this article, we recognize this role of Twitter and propose a novel, user-aware topic detection technique that permits to retrieve, in real time, the most emerging topics of discussion expressed by the community within the interests of specific users. First, we analyze the topology of Twitter looking at how the information spreads over the network, taking into account the authority\/influence of each active user. Then, we make use of a novel term aging model to compute the burstiness of each term, and provide a graph-based method to retrieve the minimal set of terms that can represent the corresponding topic. Finally, since any user can have topic preferences inferable from the shared content, we leverage such knowledge to highlight the most emerging topics within her foci of interest. As evaluation we then provide several experiments together with a user study proving the validity and reliability of the proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1684","fieldValue":" Branch prediction feeds a speculative execution processor core with instructions. Branch mispredictions are inevitable and have negative effects on performance and energy consumption. With the advent of highly accurate conditional branch predictors, nonconditional branch instructions are gaining importance. In this article, we address the prediction of procedure returns. On modern processors, procedure returns are predicted through a return address stack (RAS). The overwhelming majority of the return mispredictions are due to RAS overflows and\/or overwriting the top entries of the RAS on a mispredicted path. These sources of misprediction were addressed by previously proposed speculative return address stacks [Jourdan et al. 1996; Skadron et al. 1998]. However, the remaining misprediction rate of these RAS designs is still significant when compared to state-of-the-art conditional predictors. We present two low-cost corruption detectors for RAS predictors. They detect RAS overflows and wrong path corruption with 100&percnt; coverage. As a consequence, when such a corruption is detected, another source can be used for predicting the return. On processors featuring a branch target buffer (BTB), this BTB can be used as a free backup predictor for predicting returns when corruption is detected. Our experiments show that our proposal can be used to improve the behavior of all previously proposed speculative RASs. For instance, without any specific management of the speculative states on the RAS, an 8-entry BTB-backed up RAS achieves the same performance level as a state-of-the-art, but complex, 64-entry self-checkpointing RAS [Jourdan et al. 1996]. Therefore, our proposal can be used either to improve the performance of the processor or to reduce its hardware complexity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1684","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1684","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7524","fieldValue":" The dramatic rise in the use of social network platforms such as Facebook or Twitter has resulted in the availability of vast and growing user-contributed repositories of data. Exploiting this data by extracting useful information from it has become a great challenge in data mining and knowledge discovery. A recently popular way of extracting useful information from social network platforms is to build indicators, often in the form of a time series, of general public mood by means of sentiment analysis. Such indicators have been shown to correlate with a diverse variety of phenomena. In this article we follow this line of work and set out to assess, in a rigorous manner, whether a public sentiment indicator extracted from daily Twitter messages can indeed improve the forecasting of social, economic, or commercial indicators. To this end we have collected and processed a large amount of Twitter posts from March 2011 to the present date for two very different domains: stock market and movie box office revenue. For each of these domains, we build and evaluate forecasting models for several target time series both using and ignoring the Twitter-related data. If Twitter does help, then this should be reflected in the fact that the predictions of models that use Twitter-related data are better than the models that do not use this data. By systematically varying the models that we use and their parameters, together with other tuning factors such as lag or the way in which we build our Twitter sentiment index, we obtain a large dataset that allows us to test our hypothesis under different experimental conditions. Using a novel decision-tree-based technique that we call summary tree we are able to mine this large dataset and obtain automatically those configurations that lead to an improvement in the prediction power of our forecasting models. As a general result, we have seen that nonlinear models do take advantage of Twitter data when forecasting trends in volatility indices, while linear ones fail systematically when forecasting any kind of financial time series. In the case of predicting box office revenue trend, it is support vector machines that make best use of Twitter data. In addition, we conduct statistical tests to determine the relation between our Twitter time series and the different target time series."}
