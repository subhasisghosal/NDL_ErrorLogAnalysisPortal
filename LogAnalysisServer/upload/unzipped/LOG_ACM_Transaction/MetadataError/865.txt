Self-aligned double patterning (SADP) provides better control on line edge roughness and overlay, but it has very restrictive design constraints and prefers regular layout patterns. This article presents a comprehensive pin-access planning and regular routing framework (PARR) for SADP friendliness. Our key techniques include precomputation of both intracell and intercell pin accessibility, as well as local and global pin-access planning to enable handshaking between standard cell-level pin access and detailed routing under SADP constraints. A pin accessâ\u20AC\u201Cdriven rip-up and reroute scheme is proposed to improve the ultimate routability. Our experimental results demonstrate that PARR can achieve much better routability and overlay control compared with previous approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13505","fieldValue":"SADP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13506","fieldValue":"Gao, Jhih-Rong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13506","fieldValue":" Electron beam lithography (EBL) is a promising, maskless solution for the technology beyond 14nm logic nodes. To overcome its throughput limitation, industry has proposed character projection (CP) technique, where some complex shapes (characters) can be printed in one shot. Recently, the traditional EBL system was extended into a multi-column cell (MCC) system to further improve the throughput. In an MCC system, several independent CPs are used to further speed-up the writing process. Because of the area constraint of stencil, the MCC system needs to be packed\/planned carefully to take advantage of the characters. In this article, we prove that the overlapping aware stencil planning (OSP) problem is NP-hard. Then we propose E-BLOW, a tool to solve the MCC system OSP problem. E-BLOW involves several novel speedup techniques, such as successive relaxation and dynamic programming. Experimental results show that, compared with previous works, E-BLOW demonstrates better performance for both the conventional EBL system and the MCC system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13506","fieldValue":"ACM"}
