A usage control decision is determined by combining authorizations, obligations, and conditions, presented as UCONABC core models by Park and Sandhu. Based on these core aspects, we develop a formal model and logical specification of UCON with an extension of Lamport's temporal logic of actions (TLA). The building blocks of this model include: (1) a set of sequences of system states based on the attributes of subjects, objects, and the system, (2) authorization predicates based on subject and object attributes, (3) usage control actions to update attributes and accessing status of a usage process, (4) obligation actions, and (5) condition predicates based on system attributes. A usage control policy is defined as a set of temporal logic formulas that are satisfied as the system state changes. A fixed set of scheme rules is defined to specify general UCON policies with the properties of soundness and completeness. We show the flexibility and expressive capability of this formal model by specifying the core models of UCON and some applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22196","fieldValue":"Joshi, James B D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22196","fieldValue":" The modern enterprise spans several functional units or administrative domains with diverse authorization requirements. Access control policies in an enterprise environment typically express these requirements as authorization constraints. While desirable for access control, constraints can lead to conflicts in the overall policy in a multidomain environment. The administration problem for enterprise-wide access control, therefore, not only includes authorization management for users and resources within a single domain but also conflict resolution among heterogeneous access control policies of multiple domains to allow secure interoperation within the enterprise. This work presents design and implementation of X-GTRBAC Admin, an administration model that aims at enabling administration of role-based access control (RBAC) policies in the presence of constraints with support for conflict resolution in a multidomain environment. A key feature of the model is that it allows decentralization of policy administration tasks through the abstraction of administrative domains, which not only simplifies authorization management, but is also fundamental to the concept of decentralized conflict resolution presented. The paper also illustrates the applicability of the outlined administrative concepts in a realistic enterprise environment using an implementation prototype that facilitates policy administration in large enterprises."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22196","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22196","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22196","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22197","fieldValue":" Ubiquitous computing uses a variety of information for which access needs to be controlled. For instance, a person's current location is a sensitive piece of information that only authorized entities should be able to learn. Several challenges arise in the specification and implementation of policies controlling access to location information. For example, there can be multiple sources of location information. The sources can be within different administrative domains, which might allow different entities to specify policies, and policies need to be flexible. We address these issues in our design of a distributed access control mechanism for a people location system. Our design encodes policies as digital certificates, which enables decentralized storage of policies. We also present an algorithm for the discovery of distributed certificates. Furthermore, we discuss several privacy issues and show how our design addresses them. To show feasibility of our design, we built an example implementation based on SPKI\/SDSI certificates. Using measurements, we quantify the influence of access control on query processing time. We also discuss trade-offs between RSA-based and DSA-based signature schemes for digital certificates."}
