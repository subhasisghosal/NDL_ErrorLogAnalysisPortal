For directional sources this can be achieved by preserving the relative transfer function (RTF) which is defined as the ratio of the acoustical transfer functions relating the source and the two ears and corresponds to the binaural cues. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the performance of three algorithms that are based on the binaural minimum variance distortionless response (BMVDR) beamformer, and hence, process the desired source without distortion. The BMVDR beamformer preserves the binaural cues of the desired source but distorts the binaural cues of the interfering source. By adding an interference reduction (IR) constraint, the recently proposed BMVDR-IR beamformer is able to preserve the binaural cues of both the desired source and the interfering source. We further propose a novel algorithm for preserving the binaural cues of both the desired source and the interfering source by adding a constraint preserving the RTF of the interfering source, which will be referred to as the BMVDR-RTF beamformer. We analytically evaluate the performance in terms of binaural signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the three considered beamformers. It can be shown that the BMVDR-RTF beamformer outperforms the BMVDR-IR beamformer in terms of SINR and outperforms the BMVDR beamformer in terms of SIR. Among all beamformers which are distortionless with respect to the desired source and preserve the binaural cues of the interfering source, the newly proposed BMVDR-RTF beamformer is optimal in terms of SINR. Simulations using acoustic transfer functions measured on a binaural hearing aid validate our theoretical results."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3881","fieldValue":"Theoretical analysis of binaural transfer function MVDR beamformers with interference cue preservation constraints"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3881","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3881","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3882","fieldValue":" This paper evaluated psychophysically an ultra-low-power, analog biomimetic cochlear-implant (CI) processor filterbank architecture, which was recently proposed and demonstrated in hardware. The architecture\/strategy emulates the lateral inhibition (LI) mechanism by employing an automatic gain control (AGC) scheme that is coupled across One-Zero-Gamma-tone-Filter (OZGF) channels. The OZGF filtering and the coupled channel AGC were tested respectively in two experiments, where normal-hearing listeners were required to listen to sentences and recognise key words therein. The sentences were mixed with a steady background noise at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of -6, -3 and 0 dB, and processed through a noise-excited envelope vocoder serving as the acoustic simulator of cochlear implants. In the first experiment, the OZGF filtering was compared with cascaded bandpass biquad filtering employed in recent attempts towards fully-implantable CI processing, in terms of the resulting intelligibility. The results showed that the sharply tuned OZGF response did not degrade intelligibility despite the very limited number (16) of channels used. In the second experiment, the sentences were processed in two multi-channel compression systems, one with the channel AGC coupled, whilst another uncoupled. The results showed that the AGC-coupled system was significantly advantageous, and the improvement averaged across the SNRs is 31 percentage points. Furthermore, this compressive system results in no significant decrease in intelligibility when compared to the linear filtering systems investigated in the first experiment. Thus, the coupled channel AGC may be considered as a potential solution to the limited spectral contrast of current CI systems, which may partially account for their noise-susceptibility."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3882","fieldValue":"Psychophysical evaluation of an ultra-low power, analog biomimetic cochlear implant processor filterbank architecture with across channels AGC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3882","fieldValue":"ACM"}
