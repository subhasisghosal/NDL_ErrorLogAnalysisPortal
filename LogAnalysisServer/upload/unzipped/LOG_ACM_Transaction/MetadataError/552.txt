We feel this is a prerequisite for the efficient use of many verification techniques. We focus on computing conditions for the safe removal of a component FSM in a FSM network, where removal is safe if it preserves a certain well-defined trace equivalence. We present an optimized algorithm for determining language universality of a FSM, as well as determining independence of a FSM from those of its inputs connected to outputs of neighboring FSMs. These two properties, input independence and language universality, provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for safe removal. In addition, we show how simulation relations can be utilized, both to reduce the cost of computing safe removal and to create an appropriate abstract FSM when safe removal is not possible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12788","fieldValue":"Yan, Jin-Tai"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12788","fieldValue":" It is well known that a nonManhattan channel router can use fewer routing tracks, and is never worse than a Manhattan router in a channel. To my knowledge, a three-layer bubble-sorting-based nonManhattan channel routing problem is always solved by the solution in a two-layer bubble-sorintg-based nonManhattan channel routing problem. Recently, an O(kn2) heuristic algorithm [Chaudhary et al. 1991] and an O(kn2) optimal algorithm [Chen et al. 1994] have been proposed, where k is the number of two-layer routing tracks and n is the number of terminals in a bubble-sorintg-based nonManhattan channel. In this paper we propose an optimal three-layer bubble-sorintg-based nonManhattan routing algorithm to minimize the number of three-layer routing tracks. Furthermore, the time complexity of theis optimal algorithm is proven to be in O(hn) time, where h is the number of three-layer routing tracks and n is the number of terminals in a bubble-sorting-based nonManhattan channel."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12788","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12788","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12789","fieldValue":"Yang, Cheng-Hsing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12789","fieldValue":"Chen, Sao-Jie"}
