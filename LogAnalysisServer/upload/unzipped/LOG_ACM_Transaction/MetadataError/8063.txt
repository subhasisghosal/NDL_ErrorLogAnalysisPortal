Transmission rate of a channel evolves randomly. Each primary needs to select a price depending on the transmission rate of its channel. Each secondary selects a channel depending on the price and the transmission rate of the channel. We formulate the above problem as a noncooperative game. We show that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) and explicitly compute it. Under the NE strategy profile, a primary prices its channel to render the channel that provides high transmission rate more preferable; this negates the perception that prices ought to be selected to render channels equally preferable to the secondary regardless of their transmission rates. We show the loss of revenue in the asymptotic limit due to the noncooperation of primaries. In the repeated version of the game, we characterize a subgame perfect NE where a primary can attain a payoff arbitrarily close to the payoff it would obtain when primaries cooperate."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10937","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10937","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10938","fieldValue":" The advent and continued growth of large data centers has led to much interest in switch architectures that can economically meet the high capacities needed for interconnecting the thousands of servers in these data centers. Various multilayer architectures employing thousands of switches have been proposed in the literature. We make use of the observation that the traffic in a data center is a mixture of relatively static and rapidly fluctuating components, and develop a combined scheduler for both these components using a generalization of the load-balanced scheduler. The presence of the known static component introduces asymmetries in the ingress-egress capacities, which preclude the use of a load-balanced scheduler as is. We generalize the load-balanced scheduler and also incorporate an opportunistic scheduler that sends traffic on a direct path when feasible to enhance the overall switch throughput. Our evaluations show that this scheduler works very well despite avoiding the use of a central scheduler for making packet-by-packet scheduling decisions."}
