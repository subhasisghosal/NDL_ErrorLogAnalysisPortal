The client compiler is at the heart of the VM configuration used by default for interactive desktop applications. For such applications, low startup and pause times are more important than peak performance. This paper outlines the new architecture of the client compiler and shows how it interacts with the VM. It presents the intermediate representation that now uses static single-assignment (SSA) form and the linear scan algorithm for global register allocation. Efficient support for exception handling and deoptimization fulfills the demands that are imposed by the dynamic features of the Java programming language. The evaluation shows that the new client compiler generates better code in less time. The popular SPECjvm98 benchmark suite is executed 45&percnt; faster, while the compilation speed is also up to 40&percnt; better. This indicates that a carefully selected set of global optimizations can also be integrated in just-in-time compilers that focus on compilation speed and not on peak performance. In addition, the paper presents the impact of several optimizations on execution and compilation speed. As the source code is freely available, the Java HotSpot#8482; VM and the client compiler are the ideal basis for experiments with new feedback-directed optimizations in a production-level Java just-in-time compiler. The paper outlines research projects that add fast algorithms for escape analysis, automatic object inlining, and array bounds check elimination."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7429","fieldValue":" Multimodal understanding of shared content is an important success factor for many Web 2.0 applications and platforms. This article addresses the fundamental question of geo-spatial awareness in social media applications. In this context, we introduce an approach for improved characterization of social media by combining text features (e.g., tags as a prominent example of short, unstructured text labels) with spatial knowledge (e.g., geotags, coordinates of images, and videos). Our model-based framework GeoFolk combines these two aspects in order to construct better algorithms for content management, retrieval, and sharing. We demonstrate in systematic studies the benefits of this combination for a broad spectrum of scenarios related to social media: recommender systems, automatic content organization and filtering, and event detection. Furthermore, we establish a simple and technically sound model that can be seen as a reference baseline for future research in the field of geotagged social media."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7429","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7429","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7430","fieldValue":" The primary goal of this special section of ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology is to foster research in the interplay between Social Media, Data\/Opinion Mining and Search, aiming to reflect the actual developments in technologies that exploit user-generated content."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7430","fieldValue":"ACM"}
