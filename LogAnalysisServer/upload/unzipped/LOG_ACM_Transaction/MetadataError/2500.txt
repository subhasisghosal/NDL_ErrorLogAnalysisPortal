In particular, we show that there is no polynomial time approximation algorithm with performance guarantee better than 1.539 unless P &equals; NP for the case when k &equals; 2. For the case of general k (tending to infinity), we obtain a better hardness factor of 1.61. Interestingly, our results show that the two-level problem is computationally harder than the well-known uncapacitated facility location problem (k &equals; 1) since the best-known approximation guarantee for the latter problem is 1.488 due to Li &lsqb;2013&rsqb;, and our inapproximability is a factor of 1.539 for the two-level problem. The only inapproximability result known before for this class of metric facility location problems is the bound of 1.463 due to Guha and Khuller &lsqb;1999&rsqb;, which holds even for the case of k &equals; 1."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18459","fieldValue":" A test problem generator for large-scale unconstrained optimization is described.
