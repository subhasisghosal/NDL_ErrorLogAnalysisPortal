A learning algorithm applied to a set of relevance judgments obtained from a single human would be expected to perform on new material at a level somewhat below that human. However, we examine two learning methods which when trained on the superior source of pooled human relevance judgments are able to perform at the level of a single human on new material. All performance comparisons are based on an independent human judge. Both algorithms function by producing term weightsâ\u20AC\u201Done by a log odds calculation and the other by producing a least-squares fit to human relevance ratings. Some characteristics of the algorithms are examined."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23788","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23788","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23789","fieldValue":" The areas of application of hypermedia technology, combined with the capabilities that hypermedia provides for manipulating structure, create an environment in which version control is very important. A hypermedia version control framework has been designed to specifically address the version control problem in open hypermedia environments. One of the primary distinctions of the framework is the partitioning of hypermedia version control functionality into intrinsic and application-specific categories. The version control has been used as a model for the design of version control services for a hyperbase management system that provides complete version support for both data and structural entities. In addition to serving as a version control model for open hypermedia environments, the framework offers a clarifying and unifying context in which to examine the issues of version control in hypermedia."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23789","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23789","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23790","fieldValue":" The problem of selectivity estimation for queries of nontraditional databases is still an open issue. In this article, we examine the problem of selectivity estimation for some types of spatial queries in databases containing real data. We have shown earlier [Faloutsos and Kamel 1994] that real point sets typically have a nonuniform distribution, violating consistently the uniformity and independence assumptions. Moreover, we demonstrated that the theory of fractals can help to describe real point sets. In this article we show how the concept of fractal dimension, i.e., (noninteger) dimension, can lead to the solution for the selectivity estimation problem in spatial databases. Among the infinite family of fractal dimensions, we consider here the Hausdorff fractal dimension D0 and the â\u20ACœCorrelationâ\u20AC? fractal dimension D2. Specifically, we show that (a) the average number of neighbors for a given point set follows a power law, with D2 as exponent, and (b) the average number of nonempty range queries follows a power law with E âˆ\u2019 D0 as exponent (E is the dimension of the embedding space). We present the formulas to estimate the selectivity for â\u20ACœbiasedâ\u20AC? range queries, for self-spatial joins, and for the average number of nonempty range queries. The result of some experiments on real and synthetic point sets are shown. Our formulas achieve very low relative errors, typically about 10%, versus 40%â\u20AC\u201C100% of the formulas that are based on the uniformity and independence assumptions."}
