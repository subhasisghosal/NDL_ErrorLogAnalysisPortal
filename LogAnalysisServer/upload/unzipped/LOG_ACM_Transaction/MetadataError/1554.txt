However, acquiring high-resolution face geometry is often tedious and expensive. Consequently, most face models used in games, virtual reality, or computer vision look unrealistically smooth. In this paper, we introduce a new statistical technique for the analysis and synthesis of small three-dimensional facial features, such as wrinkles and pores. We acquire high-resolution face geometry for people across a wide range of ages, genders, and races. For each scan, we separate the skin surface details from a smooth base mesh using displaced subdivision surfaces. Then, we analyze the resulting displacement maps using the texture analysis\/synthesis framework of Heeger and Bergen, adapted to capture statistics that vary spatially across a face. Finally, we use the extracted statistics to synthesize plausible detail on face meshes of arbitrary subjects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in several applications, including analysis of facial texture in subjects with different ages and genders, interpolation between high-resolution face scans, adding detail to low-resolution face scans, and adjusting the apparent age of faces. In all cases, we are able to re-produce fine geometric details consistent with those observed in high resolution scans."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15711","fieldValue":" We present a modification to subdivision surfaces, which guarantees second-order smoothness everywhere in the surface, including extraordinary points. The idea is to blend the limit surface with a low degree polynomial defined over the characteristic map, in the vicinity of each extraordinary point. We demonstrate our method on Catmull-Clark surfaces, but a similar modification can be applied to other schemes as well. The proposed modification to Catmull-Clark is simple to implement and can be applied to quad meshes of arbitrary topological type, even when extraordinary vertices share edges."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15711","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15711","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15712","fieldValue":"Weiwei"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15712","fieldValue":" Vertex- and face-based subdivision schemes are now routinely used in geometric modeling and computational science, and their primal\/dual relationships are well studied. In this paper, we interpret these schemes as defining bases for discrete differential 0- resp. 2-forms, and complete the picture by introducing edge-based subdivision schemes to construct the missing bases for discrete differential 1-forms. Such subdivision schemes map scalar coefficients on edges from the coarse to the refined mesh and are intrinsic to the surface. Our construction is based on treating vertex-, edge-, and face-based subdivision schemes as a joint triple and enforcing that subdivision commutes with the topological exterior derivative. We demonstrate our construction for the case of arbitrary topology triangle meshes. Using Loop's scheme for 0-forms and generalized half-box splines for 2-forms results in a unique generalized spline scheme for 1-forms, easily incorporated into standard subdivision surface codes. We also provide corresponding boundary stencils. Once a metric is supplied, the scalar 1-form coefficients define a smooth tangent vector field on the underlying subdivision surface. Design of tangent vector fields is made particularly easy with this machinery as we demonstrate."}
