Different types of social ties have essentially different influences on people. Awareness of the types of social ties can benefit many applications, such as recommendation and community detection. For example, our close friends tend to move in the same circles that we do, while our classmates may be distributed into different communities. Though a bulk of research has focused on inferring particular types of relationships in a specific social network, few publications systematically study the generalization of the problem of predicting social ties across multiple heterogeneous networks. In this work, we develop a framework referred to as TranFG for classifying the type of social relationships by learning across heterogeneous networks. The framework incorporates social theories into a factor graph model, which effectively improves the accuracy of predicting the types of social relationships in a target network by borrowing knowledge from a different source network. We also present several active learning strategies to further enhance the inferring performance. To scale up the model to handle really large networks, we design a distributed learning algorithm for the proposed model. We evaluate the proposed framework (TranFG) on six different networks and compare with several existing methods. TranFG clearly outperforms the existing methods on multiple metrics. For example, by leveraging information from a coauthor network with labeled advisor-advisee relationships, TranFG is able to obtain an F1-score of 90&percnt; (8&percnt;--28&percnt; improvements over alternative methods) for predicting manager-subordinate relationships in an enterprise email network. The proposed model is efficient. It takes only a few minutes to train the proposed transfer model on large networks containing tens of thousands of nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24140","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24140","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24141","fieldValue":" Several properties of information retrieval (IR) data, such as query frequency or document length, are widely considered to be approximately distributed as a power law. This common assumption aims to focus on specific characteristics of the empirical probability distribution of such data (e.g., its scale-free nature or its long\/fat tail). This assumption, however, may not be always true. Motivated by recent work in the statistical treatment of power law claims, we investigate two research questions: (i) To what extent do power law approximations hold for term frequency, document length, query frequency, query length, citation frequency, and syntactic unigram frequency? And (ii) what is the computational cost of replacing ad hoc power law approximations with more accurate distribution fitting? We study 23 TREC and 5 non-TREC datasets and compare the fit of power laws to 15 other standard probability distributions. We find that query frequency and 5 out of 24 term frequency distributions are best approximated by a power law. All remaining properties are better approximated by the Inverse Gaussian, Generalized Extreme Value, Negative Binomial, or Yule distribution. We also find the overhead of replacing power law approximations by more informed distribution fitting to be negligible, with potential gains to IR tasks like index compression or test collection generation for IR evaluation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24141","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24141","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24142","fieldValue":"Gomez-Rodriguez, Manuel"}
