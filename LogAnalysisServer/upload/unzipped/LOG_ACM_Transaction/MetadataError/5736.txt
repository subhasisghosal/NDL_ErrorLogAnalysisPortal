We develop and evaluate a haptic direction indicator that delivers directional information in real time through kinesthetic cues. The indicator uses a novel kinesthetic perception method called the pseudo-attraction force technique, which employs the nonlinear relationship between perceived and physical acceleration to generate a force sensation. In an experiment, we find that the haptic direction indicator allowed people with visual impairments to walk safely along a predefined route at their usual walking pace without any previous training, independent of the existence of auditory information. The findings indicate that the haptic direction indicator is effective at delivering simple navigational information, and is a suitable substitute for and\/or enhancement to conventional wayfinding methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5186","fieldValue":"DeJesus, Michael A."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5186","fieldValue":" Transposon mutagenesis experiments enable the identification of essential genes in bacteria. Deep-sequencing of mutant libraries provides a large amount of high-resolution data on essentiality. Statistical methods developed to analyze this data have traditionally assumed that the probability of observing a transposon insertion is the same across the genome. This assumption, however, is inconsistent with the observed insertion frequencies from transposon mutant libraries of M. tuberculosis. We propose a modified Binomial model of essentiality that can characterize the insertion probability of individual genes in which we allow local variation in the background insertion frequency in different non-essential regions of the genome. Using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, samples of the posterior insertion probabilities were obtained for each gene, and the probability of each gene being essential is estimated. We compared our predictions to those of previous methods and show that, by taking into consideration local insertion frequencies, our method is capable of making more conservative predictions that better match what is experimentally known about essential and non-essential genes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5186","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5186","fieldValue":"Capturing uncertainty by modeling local transposon insertion frequencies improves discrimination of essential genes"}
