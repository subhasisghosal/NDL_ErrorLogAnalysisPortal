Optimal and practical mechanisms to maximize the customer average quality of service (QoS), defined in terms of a normalized time average received rate, are established. By scaling the arrival rate and link capacity, we obtain asymptotic expressions for customer average QoS in the case of networks with single bottleneck links. The optimal adaptation policy is identified as the solution to an integer program which has an intuitive \"sort by volume\" interpretation for the case of single bottleneck links, where stream volume is the total number of bits associated with a stream at its maximum resolution. Our asymptotic analysis shows the optimal adaptation policy may yield performance improvements of up to 42% over baseline policies. We demonstrate that a static multi-class admission control policy can achieve the same asymptotic QoS as that of the optimal adaptation policy. This implies that dynamic adaptation may be unnecessary for large capacity networks with appropriate call admission."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9405","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9406","fieldValue":" In this paper we propose a new fluid model approach in which a different description of the dynamics of traffic sources is adopted, exploiting partial differential equations. This new description of the source dynamics allows the natural representation of short-lived as well as long-lived TCP connections, with no sacrifice in the scalability of the model. In addition, the use of partial differential equations permits the description of distributions, instead of averages, thus providing better accuracy in the results.The comparison between the performance estimates obtained with fluid models and with ns-2 simulations proves the accuracy of the proposed modeling approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9406","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
