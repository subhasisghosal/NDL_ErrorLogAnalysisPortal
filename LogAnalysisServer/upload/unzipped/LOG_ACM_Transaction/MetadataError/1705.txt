{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16097","fieldValue":" This paper introduces an optimization-based approach to synthesizing hand manipulations from a starting grasping pose. We describe an automatic method that takes as input an initial grasping pose and partial object trajectory, and produces as output physically plausible hand animation that effects the desired manipulation. In response to different dynamic situations during manipulation, our algorithm can generate a range of possible hand manipulations including changes in joint configurations, changes in contact points, and changes in the grasping force. Formulating hand manipulation as an optimization problem is key to our algorithm's ability to generate a large repertoire of hand motions from limited user input. We introduce an objective function that accentuates the detailed hand motion and contacts adjustment. Furthermore, we describe an optimization method that solves for hand motion and contacts efficiently while taking into account long-term planning of contact forces. Our algorithm does not require any tuning of parameters, nor does it require any prescribed hand motion sequences."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16097","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16097","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16098","fieldValue":" We present a fully automatic method for generating gaits and morphologies for legged animal locomotion. Given a specific animal's shape we can determine an efficient gait with which it can move. Similarly, we can also adapt the animal's morphology to be optimal for a specific locomotion task. We show that determining such gaits is possible without the need to specify a good initial motion, and without manually restricting the allowed gaits of each animal. Our approach is based on a hybrid optimization method which combines an efficient derivative-aware spacetime constraints optimization with a derivative-free approach able to find non-local solutions in high-dimensional discontinuous spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by synthesizing dynamic locomotions of bipeds, a quadruped, and an imaginary five-legged creature."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16098","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16098","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16099","fieldValue":" Most game interfaces today are largely symbolic, translating simplified input such as keystrokes into the choreography of full-body character movement. In this paper, we describe a system that directly uses human motion performance to provide a radically different, and much more expressive interface for controlling virtual characters. Our system takes a data feed from a motion capture system as input, and in real-time translates the performance into corresponding actions in a virtual world. The difficulty with such an approach arises from the need to manage the discrepancy between the real and virtual world, leading to two important subproblems 1) recognizing the user's intention, and 2) simulating the appropriate action based on the intention and virtual context. We solve this issue by first enabling the virtual world's designer to specify possible activities in terms of prominent features of the world along with associated motion clips depicting interactions. We then integrate the prerecorded motions with online performance and dynamic simulation to synthesize seamless interaction of the virtual character in a simulated virtual world. The result is a flexible interface through which a user can make freeform control choices while the resulting character motion maintains both physical realism and the user's personal style."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16100","fieldValue":"McAdams, Aleka"}
