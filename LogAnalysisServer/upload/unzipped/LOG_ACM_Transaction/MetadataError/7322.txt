The multicast capacity cannot exceed the capacity of any cut separating the source from a destination; the minimum of the cut capacities is called the cut bound. A fundamental theorem in graph theory by Edmonds established that if all nodes other than the source are destinations, the cut bound can be achieved by routing. In general, however, the cut bound cannot be achieved by routing. Ahlswede et al. established that the cut bound can be achieved by performing network coding, which generalizes routing by allowing information to be mixed. This paper presents a unifying theorem that includes Edmonds' theorem and Ahlswede et al.'s theorem as special cases. Specifically, it shows that the multicast capacity can still be achieved even if information mixing is only allowed on edges entering relay nodes. This unifying theorem is established via a graph theoretic hardwiring theorem, together with the network coding theorems for multicasting. The proof of the hardwiring theorem implies a new proof of Edmonds' theorem."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9461","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9461","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9461","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9461","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9462","fieldValue":" We examine the throughput benefits that network coding offers with respect to the average throughput achievable by routing, where the average throughput refers to the average of the rates that the individual receivers experience. We relate these benefits to the integrality gap of a standard linear programming formulation for the directed Steiner tree problem. We describe families of configurations over which network coding at most doubles the average throughput, and analyze a class of directed graph configurations with N receivers where network coding offers benefits proportional to âˆšN. We also discuss other throughput measures in networks, and show how in certain classes of networks, average throughput bounds can be translated into minimum throughput bounds, by employing vector routing and channel coding. Finally, we show configurations where use of randomized coding may require an alphabet size exponentially larger than the minimum alphabet size required."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9462","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
