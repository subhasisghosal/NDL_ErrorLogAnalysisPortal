The most practical way to do this is to capture alternating exposures for every LDR frame and then use an alignment method based on optical flow to register the exposures together. However, this results in objectionable artifacts whenever there is complex motion and optical flow fails. To address this problem, we propose a new approach for HDR reconstruction from alternating exposure video sequences that combines the advantages of optical flow and recently introduced patch-based synthesis for HDR images. We use patch-based synthesis to enforce similarity between adjacent frames, increasing temporal continuity. To synthesize visually plausible solutions, we enforce constraints from motion estimation coupled with a search window map that guides the patch-based synthesis. This results in a novel reconstruction algorithm that can produce high-quality HDR videos with a standard camera. Furthermore, our method is able to synthesize plausible texture and motion in fast-moving regions, where either patch-based synthesis or optical flow alone would exhibit artifacts. We present results of our reconstructed HDR video sequences that are superior to those produced by current approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16984","fieldValue":" We present a trajectory optimization approach to animating human activities that are driven by the lower body. Our approach is based on contact-invariant optimization. We develop a simplified and generalized formulation of contact-invariant optimization that enables continuous optimization over contact timings. This formulation is applied to a fully physical humanoid model whose lower limbs are actuated by musculotendon units. Our approach does not rely on prior motion data or on task-specific controllers. Motion is synthesized from first principles, given only a detailed physical model of the body and spacetime constraints. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of activities, such as walking, running, jumping, and kicking. Our approach produces walking motions that quantitatively match ground-truth data, and predicts aspects of human gait initiation, incline walking, and locomotion in reduced gravity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16984","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16984","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16985","fieldValue":"OSullivan, Carol"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16985","fieldValue":" Recent advances in rendering and data-driven animation have enabled the creation of compelling characters with impressive levels of realism. While data-driven techniques can produce animations that are extremely faithful to the original motion, many challenging problems remain because of the high complexity of human motion. A better understanding of the factors that make human motion recognizable and appealing would be of great value in industries where creating a variety of appealing virtual characters with realistic motion is required. To investigate these issues, we captured thirty actors walking, jogging and dancing, and applied their motions to the same virtual character (one each for the males and females). We then conducted a series of perceptual experiments to explore the distinctiveness and attractiveness of these human motions, and whether characteristic motion features transfer across an individual's different gaits. Average faces are perceived to be less distinctive but more attractive, so we explored whether this was also true for body motion. We found that dancing motions were most easily recognized and that distinctiveness in one gait does not predict how recognizable the same actor is when performing a different motion. As hypothesized, average motions were always amongst the least distinctive and most attractive. Furthermore, as 50% of participants in the experiment were Caucasian European and 50% were Asian Korean, we found that the latter were as good as or better at recognizing the motions of the Caucasian actors than their European counterparts, in particular for dancing males, whom they also rated more highly for attractiveness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16985","fieldValue":"ACM"}
