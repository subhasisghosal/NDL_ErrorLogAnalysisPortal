Object-based audio techniques provide more flexibility for personalized rendering as well as a more accurate audio object trajectory. For encoding and transmitting multiple audio objects in a lossy manner, a new compression framework for multiple simultaneously occurring audio objects is presented in this work. The proposed encoding approach is based on the intra-object sparsity (approximate k-sparsity). After establishing a quantitative measure of approximate k-sparsity, statistical analysis is employed to validate the proposed intra-object sparsity of audio objects. By exploring this intra-object sparsity, multiple simultaneously occurring audio objects are compressed into a mono downmix signal with side information. This downmix signal can be further compressed by legacy audio codecs. Meanwhile, the side information is transmitted in a lossless manner. The objective and subjective evaluations revealed that the proposed compression framework achieved better perceptual quality compared to an existing technique where up to eight audio objects are considered. The subjective evaluations also confirmed that the proposed approach is able to achieve scalable transmission according to the bandwidth while preserving the perceptual quality of both the individual audio objects and the spatial audio scenes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3938","fieldValue":"McVicar, Matt"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3938","fieldValue":" We present AutoGuitarTab, a system for generating realistic guitar tablature given an input symbolic chord and key sequence. Our system consists of two modules: AutoRhythm-Guitar and AutoLeadGuitar. The first of these generates rhythm guitar tablatures which outline the input chord sequence in a particular style (using Markov chains to ensure playability) and performs a structural analysis to produce a structurally consistent composition. AutoLeadGuitar generates lead guitar parts in distinct musical phrases, guiding the pitch classes towards chord tones and steering the evolution of the rhythmic and melodic intensity according to user preference. Experimentally, we uncover musician-specific trends in guitar playing style, and demonstrate our system's ability to produce playable, realistic and style-specific tablature using a combination of algorithmic, user-surveyed and expert evaluation techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3938","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3938","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1301","fieldValue":" Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) offer a formal model for planning in cooperative multiagent systems where agents operate with noisy sensors and actuators, as well as local information. Prevalent solution techniques are centralized and model basedâ\u20AC\u201Dlimitations that we address by distributed reinforcement learning (RL). We particularly favor alternate learning, where agents alternately learn best responses to each other, which appears to outperform concurrent RL. However, alternate learning requires an initial policy. We propose two principled approaches to generating informed initial policies: a naive approach that lays the foundation for a more sophisticated approach. We empirically demonstrate that the refined approach produces near-optimal solutions in many challenging benchmark settings, staking a claim to being an efficient (and realistic) approximate solver in its own right. Furthermore, alternate best response learning seeded with such policies quickly learns high-quality policies as well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1301","fieldValue":"ACM"}
