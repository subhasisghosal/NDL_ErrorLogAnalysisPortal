They also need to assess the possible impacts of an accident resulting in partial or complete closure of navigation channels. For lack of adequate analytical tools, modeling and simulation are the only means for such studies. To date, however, no adequate simulation tool exists for modeling and simulating the complex traffic at a large-scale hub port. The challenge is to efficiently model the large number of interacting vessels while accurately reflecting the navigational behaviors of various types of vessels whose movements must comply with prevailing protocols in a location- and situation-aware fashion. We present a systematic approach that enables the construction of a marine traffic simulation system called MTSS. MTSS was calibrated based on detailed analysis of historical records obtained from a major hub port, and it was validated by the domain experts. MTSS was used in a capacity study of marine traffic at a hub port that is unique in the scale and complexity of its waterway networks, the intricacies of its traffic patterns, and the required accuracy of the navigational behaviors of different types of vessels. The usefulness of MTSS is further demonstrated by applying it to assess the impacts of partial closure of a waterway under an emergency scenario. For large-scale hub ports, MTSS now opens up new possibilities of realistic scenario studies and disruption management."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25169","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25169","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3435","fieldValue":"Corteel, tienne"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3435","fieldValue":"Katz, Brian F G"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3435","fieldValue":" We present a study on audio, visual, and audio-visual egocentric distance perception by moving subjects in virtual environments. Audio-visual rendering is provided using tracked passive visual stereoscopy and acoustic wave field synthesis (WFS). Distances are estimated using indirect blind-walking (triangulation) under each rendering condition. Experimental results show that distances perceived in the virtual environment are systematically overestimated for rendered distances closer than the position of the audio-visual rendering system and underestimated for farther distances. Interestingly, subjects perceived each virtual object at a modality-independent distance when using the audio modality, the visual modality, or the combination of both. WFS was able to synthesise perceptually meaningful sound fields. Dynamic audio-visual cues were used by subjects when estimating the distances in the virtual world. Moving may have provided subjects with a better visual distance perception of close distances than if they were static. No correlation between the feeling of presence and the visual distance underestimation has been found. To explain the observed perceptual distance compression, it is proposed that, due to conflicting distance cues, the audio-visual rendering system physically anchors the virtual world to the real world. Virtual objects are thus attracted by the physical audio-visual rendering system."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3435","fieldValue":"Audio, visual, and audio-visual egocentric distance perception by moving subjects in virtual environments"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3435","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3435","fieldValue":"ACM"}
