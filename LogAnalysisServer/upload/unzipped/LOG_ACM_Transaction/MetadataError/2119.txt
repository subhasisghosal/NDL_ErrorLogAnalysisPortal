Given a source and a target shape, our method blends them topologically and geometrically, producing continuous series of in-betweens as new shape creations. The blending operations are defined on a spatio-structural graph composed of medial curves and sheets. Such a shape abstraction is structure-oriented, part-aware, and facilitates topology manipulations. Fundamental topological operations including split and merge are realized by allowing one-to-many correspondences between the source and the target. Multiple blending paths are sampled and presented in an interactive, exploratory tool for creative 3D modeling. We show a variety of topology-varying 3D shapes generated via continuous structural blending between man-made shapes exhibiting complex topological differences, in real time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17151","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17151","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17152","fieldValue":" Intrinsic image decomposition separates an image into a reflectance layer and a shading layer. Automatic intrinsic image decomposition remains a significant challenge, particularly for real-world scenes. Advances on this longstanding problem have been spurred by public datasets of ground truth data, such as the MIT Intrinsic Images dataset. However, the difficulty of acquiring ground truth data has meant that such datasets cover a small range of materials and objects. In contrast, real-world scenes contain a rich range of shapes and materials, lit by complex illumination. In this paper we introduce Intrinsic Images in the Wild, a large-scale, public dataset for evaluating intrinsic image decompositions of indoor scenes. We create this benchmark through millions of crowdsourced annotations of relative comparisons of material properties at pairs of points in each scene. Crowdsourcing enables a scalable approach to acquiring a large database, and uses the ability of humans to judge material comparisons, despite variations in illumination. Given our database, we develop a dense CRF-based intrinsic image algorithm for images in the wild that outperforms a range of state-of-the-art intrinsic image algorithms. Intrinsic image decomposition remains a challenging problem; we release our code and database publicly to support future research on this problem, available online at http:\/\/intrinsic.cs.cornell.edu\/."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17152","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17152","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17153","fieldValue":"Zhu, Jun-Yan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17153","fieldValue":" This paper proposes an interactive framework that allows a user to rapidly explore and visualize a large image collection using the medium of average images. Average images have been gaining popularity as means of artistic expression and data visualization, but the creation of compelling examples is a surprisingly laborious and manual process. Our interactive, real-time system provides a way to summarize large amounts of visual data by weighted average(s) of an image collection, with the weights reflecting user-indicated importance. The aim is to capture not just the mean of the distribution, but a set of modes discovered via interactive exploration. We pose this exploration in terms of a user interactively \"editing\" the average image using various types of strokes, brushes and warps, similar to a normal image editor, with each user interaction providing a new constraint to update the average. New weighted averages can be spawned and edited either individually or jointly. Together, these tools allow the user to simultaneously perform two fundamental operations on visual data: user-guided clustering and user-guided alignment, within the same framework. We show that our system is useful for various computer vision and graphics applications."}
