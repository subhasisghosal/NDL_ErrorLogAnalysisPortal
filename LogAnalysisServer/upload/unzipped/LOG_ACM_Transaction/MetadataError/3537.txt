{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21510","fieldValue":" Sensor mission assignment involves matching the sensing resources of a wireless sensor network (WSN) to appropriate tasks (missions), which may come to the network dynamically. Although solutions for WSNs with battery-operated nodes have been proposed for this problem, no attention has been given to networks whose nodes have energy-harvesting capabilities and are powered in part by uncontrollable environmental sources, which impose quite a different energy model. In this article we address this problem by providing both an analytical model and a distributed heuristic, called EN-MASSE, specifically tailored for energy-harvesting mission-centric WSNs. To assess the performance of our proposed solution we have interfaced TelosB nodes with solar cells and performed extensive experiments to derive models and traces of solar energy acquisition. We use such real-life traces in our simulations. A comparative performance evaluation between EN-MASSE and other schemes previously proposed in the literature has shown that our solution significantly outperforms existing energy-harvesting-unaware mission assignment schemes. Moreover, using our analytical model as a benchmark, we also show that the profit earned by EN-MASSE is close to the optimum. Finally, we have implemented our proposed solution in TinyOS and experimentally validated its performance, showing the effectiveness of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21510","fieldValue":"MIP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21511","fieldValue":" Recent years have witnessed the pilot deployments of audio or low-rate video wireless sensor networks for a class of mission-critical applications including search-and-rescue, security surveillance, and disaster management. In this article, we report the design and implementation of Quality-aware Voice Streaming (QVS) for wireless sensor networks. QVS is built upon SenEar, a new sensor hardware platform we developed for high-bandwidth wireless audio communication. QVS comprises several novel components, which include an empirical model for online voice-quality evaluation and control, dynamic voice compression\/duplication adaptation for lossy wireless links, and distributed stream admission control that exploits network capacity for rate allocation. We have extensively tested QVS on a 20-node network deployment. Our experimental results show that QVS delivers satisfactory voice quality under a range of realistic settings while achieving high network capacity utilization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21512","fieldValue":" While it is essential to exploit in-network processing in wireless sensor networks in order to save bandwidth and energy, we are constrained by the limited storage available in off-the-shelf sensor devices. NAND flash memory has great potential for extending storage capacity for sensor applications. Since each sensor platform is typically equipped with limited main memory and sensor data, as well as the fact that queries are temporal, existing flash index or file systems for general portable devices are not suitable for sensor networks. We propose Time-Log Tree (TL-Tree), a novel unbalanced and cascaded structure, that takes advantage of available flash capacity while making use of the time-series property as a primary feature for optimizing both memory and energy constraints. Extensive experiments show TL-Tree's ability to utilize both flash capacity and temporal locality to support sensor data processing. Compared to other schemes, it achieves much better access and energy savings for different kinds of random and temporal range queries. In addition, TL-Tree can also be easily extended to support value-based queries. We have developed a hardware board that includes a raw 128MB NAND flash chip on MicaZ mote. We have also implemented a flash driver and the TL-Tree to demonstrate the practicality of this idea."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21512","fieldValue":"ACM"}
