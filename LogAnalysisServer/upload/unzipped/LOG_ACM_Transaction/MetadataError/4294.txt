{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23912","fieldValue":" The use of text summaries in information-seeking research has focused on query-based summaries. Extracting content that resembles the query alone, however, ignores the greater context of the document. Such context may be central to the purpose and meaning of the document. We developed a generic, a query-based, and a hybrid summarizer, each with differing amounts of document context. The generic summarizer used a blend of discourse information and information obtained through traditional surface-level analysis. The query-based summarizer used only query-term information, and the hybrid summarizer used some discourse information along with query-term information. The validity of the generic summarizer was shown through an intrinsic evaluation using a well-established corpus of human-generated summaries. All three summarizers were then compared in an information-seeking experiment involving 297 subjects. Results from the information-seeking experiment showed that the generic summaries outperformed all others in the browse tasks, while the query-based and hybrid summaries outperformed the generic summary in the search tasks. Thus, the document context of generic summaries helped users browse, while such context was not helpful in search tasks. Such results are interesting given that generic summaries have not been studied in search tasks and the that majority of Internet search engines rely solely on query-based summaries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23912","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23912","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23913","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23913","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3323","fieldValue":" Humans have the ability to identify objects under varying lighting conditions with extraordinary accuracy. We investigated the behavioral aspects of this ability and compared it to the performance of the illumination cones (IC) model of Belhumeur and Kriegman [1998]. In five experiments, observers learned 10 faces under a small subset of illumination directions. We then tested observers' recognition ability under different illuminations. Across all experiments, recognition performance was found to be dependent on the distance between the trained and tested illumination directions. This effect was modulated by the nature of the trained illumination directions. Generalizations from frontal illuminations were different than generalizations from extreme illuminations. Similarly, the IC model was also sensitive to whether the trained images were near-frontal or extreme. Thus, we find that the nature of the images in the training set affects the accuracy of an object's representation under variable lighting for both humans and the model. Beyond this general correspondence, the microstructure of the generalization patterns for both humans and the IC model were remarkably similar, suggesting that the two systems may employ related algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23914","fieldValue":" Technological developments in content-based analysis of digital video information are undergoing much progress, with ideas for fully automatic systems now being proposed and demonstrated. Yet because we do not yet have robust operational video retrieval systems that can be deployed and used, the usual HCI practise of conducting a usage study and an informed iterative system design is thus not possible. Físchlár-News is one of the first automatic, content-based broadcast news analysis and archival systems that process broadcast news video so that users can search, browse, and play it in an easy-to-use manner with a conventional web browser. The system incorporates a number of state-of-the-art research components, some of which are not yet considered mature technology, yet it has been built to be robust enough to be deployed to users who are interested in access to daily news throughout a university campus. In this article we report and discuss a user-evaluation study conducted with 16 users, each of whom utilized the system freely for a one month period. Results from a detailed qualitative analysis are presented, looking at collected questionnaires, incident diaries, and interaction-log data. The findings suggest that our users employed the system in conjunction with their other news update methods, such as watching TV news at home and browsing online news websites at their workplace, their major concerns being up-to-dateness and coverage of the news content. They tried to accommodate the system to fit their established web browsing habits, and they found local news content and the ability to play self-contained news stories on their desktop as major values of the system. Our study also resulted in a detailed wishlist of new features which will help in the further development of both our and others' systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23914","fieldValue":"ACM"}
