{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9856","fieldValue":" We revisit the problem of detecting greedy behavior in the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol by evaluating the performance of two previously proposed schemes: DOMINO and the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). Our evaluation is carried out in four steps. We first derive a new analytical formulation of the SPRT that considers access to the wireless medium in discrete time slots. Then, we introduce an analytical model for DOMINO. As a third step, we evaluate the theoretical performance of SPRT and DOMINO with newly introduced metrics that take into account the repeated nature of the tests. This theoretical comparison provides two major insights into the problem: it confirms the optimality of SPRT, and motivates us to define yet another test: a nonparametric CUSUM statistic that shares the same intuition as DOMINO but gives better performance. We finalize the paper with experimental results, confirming the correctness of our theoretical analysis and validating the introduction of the new nonparametric CUSUM statistic."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9856","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9856","fieldValue":"CUSUM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9856","fieldValue":"DOMINO"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9856","fieldValue":"SPRT"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9856","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9856","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9857","fieldValue":" Depending upon the type of feedback that is primarily used as a congestion measure, congestion control methods can be generally classified into two categories: marking\/loss-based or delay-based. While both marking and queueing delay provide information about the congestion state of a network, they have been largely treated with separate control strategies. In this paper, we propose the notion of the normalized queueing delay, which serves as a congestion measure by combining both delay and marking information. Utilizing normalized queueing delay (NQD), we propose an approach to congestion control that allows a source to scale its rate dynamically to prevailing network conditions through the use of a time-variant set-point. In ns-2 simulation studies, an NQD-enabled FAST TCP demonstrates a significant link utilization improvement over FAST TCP under certain conditions. In addition, we propose another NQD-based controller D + M TCP (Delay+Marking TCP) that achieves quick convergence to fair and stable rates with nearly full link utilization. Therefore, NQD is a suitable candidate as a congestion measure for practical congestion control."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9857","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9857","fieldValue":"TCP"}
