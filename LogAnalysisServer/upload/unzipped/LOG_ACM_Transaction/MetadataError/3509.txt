Of those, an important one is of providing privacy to the event-detecting sensor node and integrity to the data gathered by the node. Compromised source privacy can inadvertently leak event location. Safeguarding the privacy of the source node is important, as sensor networks hold critical roles in military application, tracking endangered species, etc. Existing techniques in sensor networks use either random walk path or generate fake event packets to make it hard for an adversary to trace back to the source, since encryption alone may not help prevent a traffic analysis attack. In this work, without using traditional overhead-intensive methods, we present a scheme for hiding source information using cryptographic techniques incurring lower overhead. The packet is modified en route by dynamically selected nodes to make it difficult for a malicious entity to trace back the packet to a source node and also to prevent packet spoofing. This is important because the adversary model considers a super-local eavesdropper having the ability to compromise sensor nodes. Additionally, we provide a method for the base station to recover corrupted packets and identify the location of the compromised node. We analyze the ability of our proposed scheme to withstand different attacks and demonstrate its efficiency in terms of overhead and functionality when compared to existing work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21446","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21446","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21447","fieldValue":"Pishro-Nik, Hossein"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21447","fieldValue":" Many analytic results for the connectivity, coverage, and capacity of wireless networks have been reported for the case where the number of nodes, n, tends to infinity (large-scale networks). The majority of these results have not been extended for small or moderate values of n; whereas in many practical networks, n is not very large. In this article, we consider finite (small-scale) wireless sensor networks. We first show that previous asymptotic results provide poor approximations for such networks. We provide a set of differences between small-scale and large-scale analysis and propose a methodology for analysis of finite sensor networks. Furthermore, we consider two models for such networks: unreliable sensor grids and sensor networks with random node deployment. We provide easily computable expressions for bounds on the coverage and connectivity of these networks. With validation from simulations, we show that the derived analytic expressions give very good estimates of such quantities for finite sensor networks. Our investigation confirms the fact that small-scale networks possess unique characteristics different from their large-scale counterparts, necessitating the development of a new framework for their analysis and design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21447","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21447","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21448","fieldValue":" We consider a sensor network involving sensors placed in specific locations. An area phenomenon is detected and tracked by activated sensors. The area phenomenon is modeled to consist of K spatially distributed point phenomena. The activated sensors collect data samples characterizing the parameters of the involved point phenomena. They compress observed data readings and transport them to a processing center. The center processes the received data to derive estimates of the point phenomena's parameters. Our sensing stochastic process models account for distance-dependent observation noise perturbations as well as noise correlations. At the processing center, sample mean calculations are used to derive the estimates of the underlying area phenomenon's parameters. We develop computationally efficient algorithms to determine the specific set of sensors for activation under capacity and energy resource constraints so that a sufficiently low reproduction distortion level is attained. We derive lower bounds on the realizable levels of the distortion measure. Using illustrative cases, we demonstrate one of our algorithms to yield distortion levels that are very close to the lower bound, while other lower-complexity schemes often yield distortion levels relatively close to the lower bound."}
