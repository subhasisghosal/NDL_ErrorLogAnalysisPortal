Given a few user-provided examples, our system can synthesize a diverse set of plausible new scenes by learning from a larger scene database. We rely on three novel contributions. First, we introduce a probabilistic model for scenes based on Bayesian networks and Gaussian mixtures that can be trained from a small number of input examples. Second, we develop a clustering algorithm that groups objects occurring in a database of scenes according to their local scene neighborhoods. These contextual categories allow the synthesis process to treat a wider variety of objects as interchangeable. Third, we train our probabilistic model on a mix of user-provided examples and relevant scenes retrieved from the database. This mixed model learning process can be controlled to introduce additional variety into the synthesized scenes. We evaluate our algorithm through qualitative results and a perceptual study in which participants judged synthesized scenes to be highly plausible, as compared to hand-created scenes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16724","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16724","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16725","fieldValue":" We present an interactive approach to semantic modeling of indoor scenes with a consumer-level RGBD camera. Using our approach, the user first takes an RGBD image of an indoor scene, which is automatically segmented into a set of regions with semantic labels. If the segmentation is not satisfactory, the user can draw some strokes to guide the algorithm to achieve better results. After the segmentation is finished, the depth data of each semantic region is used to retrieve a matching 3D model from a database. Each model is then transformed according to the image depth to yield the scene. For large scenes where a single image can only cover one part of the scene, the user can take multiple images to construct other parts of the scene. The 3D models built for all images are then transformed and unified into a complete scene. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach by modeling several real-world scenes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16725","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16725","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16726","fieldValue":" We present an algorithm for recognition and reconstruction of scanned 3D indoor scenes. 3D indoor reconstruction is particularly challenging due to object interferences, occlusions and overlapping which yield incomplete yet very complex scene arrangements. Since it is hard to assemble scanned segments into complete models, traditional methods for object recognition and reconstruction would be inefficient. We present a search-classify approach which interleaves segmentation and classification in an iterative manner. Using a robust classifier we traverse the scene and gradually propagate classification information. We reinforce classification by a template fitting step which yields a scene reconstruction. We deform-to-fit templates to classified objects to resolve classification ambiguities. The resulting reconstruction is an approximation which captures the general scene arrangement. Our results demonstrate successful classification and reconstruction of cluttered indoor scenes, captured in just few minutes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16726","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16726","fieldValue":"ACM"}
