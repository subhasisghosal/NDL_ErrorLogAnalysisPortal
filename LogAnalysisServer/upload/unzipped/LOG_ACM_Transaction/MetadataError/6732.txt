Researchers have long known about the existence of Sybil accounts in online communities such as file-sharing systems, but they have not been able to perform large-scale measurements to detect them or measure their activities. In this article, we describe our efforts to detect, characterize, and understand Sybil account activity in the Renren Online Social Network (OSN). We use ground truth provided by Renren Inc. to build measurement-based Sybil detectors and deploy them on Renren to detect more than 100,000 Sybil accounts. Using our full dataset of 650,000 Sybils, we examine several aspects of Sybil behavior. First, we study their link creation behavior and find that contrary to prior conjecture, Sybils in OSNs do not form tight-knit communities. Next, we examine the fine-grained behaviors of Sybils on Renren using clickstream data. Third, we investigate behind-the-scenes collusion between large groups of Sybils. Our results reveal that Sybils with no explicit social ties still act in concert to launch attacks. Finally, we investigate enhanced techniques to identify stealthy Sybils. In summary, our study advances the understanding of Sybil behavior on OSNs and shows that Sybils can effectively avoid existing community-based Sybil detectors. We hope that our results will foster new research on Sybil detection that is based on novel types of Sybil features."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7962","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7962","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7963","fieldValue":"Lee, Victor E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7963","fieldValue":" A key task in analyzing social networks and other complex networks is role analysis: describing and categorizing nodes according to how they interact with other nodes. Two nodes have the same role if they interact with equivalent sets of neighbors. The most fundamental role equivalence is automorphic equivalence. Unfortunately, the fastest algorithms known for graph automorphism are nonpolynomial. Moreover, since exact equivalence is rare, a more meaningful task is measuring the role similarity between any two nodes. This task is closely related to the structural or link-based similarity problem that SimRank addresses. However, SimRank and other existing similarity measures are not sufficient because they do not guarantee to recognize automorphically or structurally equivalent nodes. This article makes two contributions. First, we present and justify several axiomatic properties necessary for a role similarity measure or metric. Second, we present RoleSim, a new similarity metric that satisfies these axioms and can be computed with a simple iterative algorithm. We rigorously prove that RoleSim satisfies all of these axiomatic properties. We also introduce Iceberg RoleSim, a scalable algorithm that discovers all pairs with RoleSim scores above a user-defined threshold Î¸. We demonstrate the interpretative power of RoleSim on both both synthetic and real datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7963","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7963","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7964","fieldValue":" People's personal social networks are big and cluttered, and currently there is no good way to automatically organize them. Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (e.g., â\u20ACœcirclesâ\u20AC? on Google&plus;, and â\u20ACœlistsâ\u20AC? on Facebook and Twitter). However, circles are laborious to construct and must be manually updated whenever a user's network grows. In this article, we study the novel task of automatically identifying users' social circles. We pose this task as a multimembership node clustering problem on a user's ego network, a network of connections between her friends. We develop a model for detecting circles that combines network structure as well as user profile information. For each circle, we learn its members and the circle-specific user profile similarity metric. Modeling node membership to multiple circles allows us to detect overlapping as well as hierarchically nested circles. Experiments show that our model accurately identifies circles on a diverse set of data from Facebook, Google&plus;, and Twitter, for all of which we obtain hand-labeled ground truth."}
