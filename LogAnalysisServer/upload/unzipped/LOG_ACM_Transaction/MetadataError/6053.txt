Our goal is to analyze this setting for a simple, yet highly interesting, AND-OR game, where one agent is single minded and the other is unit demand. We find a mixed equilibrium of this game and show that every other equilibrium admits the same expected allocation and payments. In addition, we study the equilibrium, highlighting the change in revenue and social welfare as a function of the playersâ\u20AC™ valuations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6074","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6074","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6075","fieldValue":" We study mechanisms for the combinatorial auction (CA) problem, in which m objects are sold to rational agents and the goal is to maximize social welfare. Of particular interest is the special case of s-CAs, where agents are interested in sets of size at most s, for which a simple greedy algorithm obtains an s + 1 approximation, but no polynomial time deterministic truthful mechanism is known to attain an approximation ratio better than O(m\/&sqrt;log m). We view this not only as an extreme gap between the power of greedy auctions and truthful greedy auctions, but also as exemplifying the gap between the known power of truthful and non-truthful polynomial time deterministic algorithms. We associate the notion of greediness with a broad class of algorithms, known as priority algorithms, which encapsulate many natural auction methods. This motivates us to ask: how well can a truthful greedy algorithm approximate the optimal social welfare for CA problems? We show that no truthful greedy priority algorithm can obtain an approximation to the CA problem that is sublinear in m, even for s-CAs with s â\u2030¥ 2. Our inapproximations are independent of any time constraints on the mechanism and are purely a consequence of the greedy-type restriction. We conclude that any truthful combinatorial auction mechanism with a non-trivial approximation factor must fall outside the scope of many natural auction methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6075","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6075","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6076","fieldValue":" We introduce a quantitative approach to comparative statics that allows to bound the maximum effect of an exogenous parameter change on a systemâ\u20AC™s equilibrium. The motivation for this approach is a well-known paradox in multimarket Cournot competition, where a positive price shock on a monopoly market may actually reduce the monopolistâ\u20AC™s profit. We use our approach to quantify for the first time the worst-case profit reduction for multimarket oligopolies exposed to arbitrary positive price shocks. For markets with affine price functions and firms with convex cost technologies, we show that the relative profit loss of any firm is at most 25%, no matter how many firms compete in the oligopoly. We further investigate the impact of positive price shocks on total profit of all firms as well as on social welfare. We find tight bounds also for these measures showing that total profit and social welfare decreases by at most 25% and 16.6%, respectively. Finally, we show that in our model, mixed, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria are essentially unique, thus, all our bounds apply to these game solutions, as well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6076","fieldValue":"ACM"}
