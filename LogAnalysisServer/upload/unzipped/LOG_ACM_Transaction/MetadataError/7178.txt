First, we show that the topology can be described efficiently with power laws. The elegance and simplicity of the power laws provide a novel perspective into the seemingly uncontrolled Internet structure. Second, we show that power laws have appeared consistently over the last five years. We also observe that the power laws hold even in the most recent and more complete topology with correlation coefficient above 99% for the degree-based power law. In addition, we study the evolution of the power-law exponents over the five-year interval and observe a variation for the degree-based power law of less than 10%. Third, we provide relationships between the exponents and other topological metrics."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9177","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9177","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9177","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1119","fieldValue":" Despite the growing interest in pheromone-based interaction to enforce adaptive and context-aware coordination, the number of deployed systems exploiting digital pheromones to coordinate the activities of situated autonomous agents is still very limited. In this article, we present a simple low-cost and general-purpose implementation of a pheromone-based interaction mechanism for pervasive environments. This is realized by making use of RFID tags to store digital pheromones and by having humans or robots spread\/sense pheromones by properly writing\/reading RFID tags populating the surrounding physical environment. We exemplify and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach via an application for object-tracking. This application allows robots and humans to find forgotten-somewhere objects by following pheromones trails associated with them. In addition, we sketch further potential applications of our approach in pervasive computing scenarios, discuss related work in the area, and identify future research directions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1119","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1119","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1826","fieldValue":"Crespi Reghizzi, Stefano"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1826","fieldValue":" Optimizing programs to exploit the underlying hardware architecture is an important task. Much research has been done on enabling compilers to find the best set of code optimizations that can build the fastest and less resource-hungry executable for a given program. A common approach is iterative compilation, sometimes enriched by machine learning techniques. This provides good results, but requires extremely long compilation times and an initial training phase lasting even for days or weeks. We present long-term learning, a new algorithm that allows the compiler user to improve the performance of compiled programs with reduced compilation times with respect to iterative compilation, and without an initial training phase. Our algorithm does not just build good programs: it acquires knowledge every time a program is compiled and it uses such knowledge to learn compiler heuristics, without the need for an expert to manually define them. The heuristics are evolved during every compilation, by evaluating their effect on the generated programs. We present implementations of long-term learning on top of two different compilers, and experimental data gathered on multiple hardware configurations showing its effectiveness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1826","fieldValue":"ACM"}
