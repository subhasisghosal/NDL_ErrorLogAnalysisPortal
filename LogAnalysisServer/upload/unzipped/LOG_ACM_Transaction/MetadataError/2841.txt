The collection contains problems from models of real-life applications as well as ones constructed specifically to have particular properties. A classification is given of polynomial eigenvalue problems according to their structural properties. Identifiers based on these and other properties can be used to extract particular types of problems from the collection. A brief description of each problem is given. NLEVP serves both to illustrate the tremendous variety of applications of nonlinear eigenvalue problems and to provide representative problems for testing, tuning, and benchmarking of algorithms and codes."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19340","fieldValue":"MATLAB"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19341","fieldValue":" We illustrate how linear algebra calculations can be enhanced by statistical techniques in the case of a square linear system Axâ\u20AC\u2030=â\u20AC\u2030b. We study a random transformation of A that enables us to avoid pivoting and then to reduce the amount of communication. Numerical experiments show that this randomization can be performed at a very affordable computational price while providing us with a satisfying accuracy when compared to partial pivoting. This random transformation called Partial Random Butterfly Transformation (PRBT) is optimized in terms of data storage and flops count. We propose a solver where PRBT and the LU factorization with no pivoting take advantage of the current hybrid multicore\/GPU machines and we compare its Gflop\/s performance with a solver implemented in a current parallel library."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19341","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19341","fieldValue":"ACM"}
