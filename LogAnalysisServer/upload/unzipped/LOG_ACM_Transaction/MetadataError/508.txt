The Circle Formation Problem (CFP) consists of the design of a protocol insuring that, starting from an initial arbitrary configuration where no two robots are at the same position, all the robots eventually form a regular n-gonâ\u20AC\u201Dthe robots take place on the circumference of a circle C with equal spacing between any two adjacent robots on C. CFP is known to be unsolvable by arranging the robots evenly along the circumference of a circle C without leaving Câ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, starting from a configuration where the robots are on the boundary of C. We circumvent this impossibility result by designing a scheme based on concentric circles. This is the first scheme that deterministically solves CFP. We present our method with two different implementations working in the semi-synchronous system (SSM) for any number n â\u2030¥ 5 of robots."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1148","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1148","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2205","fieldValue":" This article has two main results. First, we develop a simple algorithm to list all nonisomorphic rooted plane trees in lexicographic order using a level sequence representation. Then, by selecting a unique centroid to act as the root of a free plane tree, we apply the rooted plane tree algorithm to develop an algorithm to list all nonisomorphic free plane trees. The latter algorithm also uses a level sequence representation and lists all free plane trees with a unique centroid first followed by all free plane trees with two centroids. Both algorithms are proved to run in constant amortized time using straightforward bounding methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12683","fieldValue":" In this article we address the problem of optimization of VLSI circuits to minimize power consumption while meeting performance goals. We present a method of estimating power consumption of a basic or complex CMOS gate which takes the internal capacitances of the gate into account. This method is used to select an ordering of series-connected transistors found in CMOS gates to achieve lower power consumption. The method is very efficient when used by library-based design styles. We describe a multipass algorithm that makes use of transistor reordering to optimize performance and power consumption of circuits, has a linear time complexity per pass, and converges to a solution in a small number of passes. Transformations in addition to transistor reordering can be used by the algorithm. The algorithm has been benchmarked on several large examples and the results are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12683","fieldValue":"ACM"}
