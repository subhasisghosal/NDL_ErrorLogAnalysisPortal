A number of logical characterizations of the main behavioral relations on PLTSs have been studied. In particular, Parma and Segala [2007] and Hermanns et al. [2011] define a probabilistic Hennessy-Milner logic interpreted over probability distributions, whose corresponding logical equivalence\/preorder when restricted to Dirac distributions coincides with standard bisimulation\/simulation between the states of a PLTS. This result is here extended by studying the full logical equivalence\/preorder between (possibly non-Dirac) distributions in terms of a notion of bisimulation\/simulation defined on an LTS whose states are distributions (dLTS). We show that the well-known spectrum of behavioral relations on nonprobabilistic LTSs as well as their corresponding logical characterizations in terms of Hennessy-Milner logic scales to the probabilistic setting when considering dLTSs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11724","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11724","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11725","fieldValue":" In many applications, Knowledge Bases (KBs) contain confidential or private information (secrets). The KB should be able to use this secret information in its reasoning process but in answering user queries care must be exercised so that secrets are not revealed to unauthorized users. We consider this problem under the Open World Assumption (OWA) in a setting with multiple querying agents $M_1,â\u20AC¦, Mm that can pose queries against the KB K and selectively share answers that they receive from K with one or more other querying agents. We assume that for each Mi, the KB has a prespecified set of secrets Si that need to be protected from Mi. Communication between querying agents is modeled by a communication graph, a directed graph with self-loops. We introduce a general framework and propose an approach to secrecy-preserving query answering based on sound and complete proof systems. The idea is to hide the truthful answer from a querying agent Mi by feigning ignorance without lying (i.e., to provide the answer â\u20AC˜Unknownâ\u20AC™ to a query q if it needs to be protected. Under the OWA, a querying agent cannot distinguish between the case that q is being protected (for reasons of secrecy) and the case that it cannot be inferred from K. In the pre-query stage we compute a set of envelopes E1, â\u20AC¦, Em (restricted to a finite subset of the set of formulae that are entailed by K) so that SiâŠ\u2020 Ei, and a query Î± posed by agent Mi can be answered truthfully whenever Î± âˆ\u2030 Ei and Â¬ Î± âˆ\u2030 Ei$. After the pre-query stage, the envelope is updated as needed. We illustrate this approach with two simple cases: the Propositional Horn KBs and the Description Logic AL KBs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11725","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11725","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11726","fieldValue":" When studying probabilistic dynamical systems, temporal logic has typically been used to analyze path properties. Recently, there has been some interest in analyzing the dynamical evolution of state probabilities of these systems. In this article, we show that verifying linear temporal properties concerning the state evolution induced by a Markov chain is equivalent to the decidability of the Skolem problem -- a long-standing open problem in Number Theory. However, from a practical point of view, usually it is enough to check properties up to some acceptable error bound &epsi;. We show that an approximate version of the Skolem problem is decidable, and that it can be applied to verify, up to arbitrarily small &epsi;, linear temporal properties of the state evolution induced by a Markov chain."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11726","fieldValue":"Decidability of Approximate Skolem Problem and Applications to Logical Verification of Dynamical Properties of Markov Chains"}
