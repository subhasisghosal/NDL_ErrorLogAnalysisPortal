Previous works have showed that the end-to-end delay scales linearly with the source-to-destination distance, and thus the delay performance can be characterized by the delay-distance ratio γ. However, the range of γ, which may be the most important parameter for delay, remains unknown. We expect that γ may depend heavily on the node density λ of a wireless multihop network. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental relationship between γ and λ. Obtaining the exact value of γ(λ) is extremely hard, mainly because of the dynamically changing network topologies caused by the link unreliability. Instead, we provide both upper bound and lower bound to the delay-distance ratio γ(λ). Simulations are conducted to verify our theoretical analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10634","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10634","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10634","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10635","fieldValue":" Sensor-enabled radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has generated a lot of interest from industries lately. Integrated with miniaturized sensors, RFID tags can provide not only the IDs, but also valuable real-time information about the state of the objects or their surrounding environment, which can benefit many practical applications, such as warehouse management and inventory control. In this paper, we study the problem of designing efficient protocols for a reader to collect sensor-produced information from unknown target tags in an RFID system with minimum execution time. Different from information collection with all target tags known a priori, in the scenarios we consider, the reader has to first find out the target tags in order to read information from them, which makes traditional information collection protocols not efficient any more. We design a Bloom-filter-based information collection protocol (BIC) to address this challenging problem. A Bloom filter is constructed for the reader to efficiently determine the target tags, which significantly reduces the communication and time overhead. We also introduce the allocation vectors to coordinate the transmissions from different tags and minimize collision during information collection. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our protocol is highly efficient in terms of execution time, and it performs much better than other solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10635","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10635","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10635","fieldValue":"ACM"}
