This motivates the game-theoretic study of network formation, and our article considers one of the most well-studied models, originally proposed by Fabrikant et al. In the model, each of n agents corresponds to a vertex, which can create edges to other vertices at a cost of Î± each, for some parameter Î±. Every edge can be freely used by every vertex, regardless of who paid the creation cost. To reflect the desire to be close to other vertices, each agentâ\u20AC™s cost function is further augmented by the sum total of all (graph-theoretic) distances to all other vertices. Previous research proved that for many regimes of the (Î±, n) parameter space, the total social cost (sum of all agentsâ\u20AC™ costs) of every Nash equilibrium is bounded by at most a constant multiple of the optimal social cost. In algorithmic game-theoretic nomenclature, this approximation ratio is called the price of anarchy. In our article, we significantly sharpen some of those results, proving that for all constant nonintegral Î± > 2, the price of anarchy is in fact 1 + o(1); that is, not only is it bounded by a constant, but also it tends to 1 as n â\u2020\u2019 âˆž. For constant integral Î± &ges; 2, we show that the price of anarchy is bounded away from 1. We provide quantitative estimates on the rates of convergence for both results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18036","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18036","fieldValue":"ACM"}
