We propose an adaptive probabilistic model that accrues temporal camera correlations over time as the cameras report observed events. No extrinsic, intrinsic, or color calibration of cameras is required. We efficiently obtain the camera parameter predictions using a modified Sequential Monte Carlo method. We demonstrate the performance of the model in an example face detection scenario in both simulated and real environment experiments, using several active cameras."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21377","fieldValue":" This article develops a utility-based optimization framework for resource sharing by multiple competing missions in a mission-oriented wireless sensor network (WSN) environment. Prior work on network utility maximization (NUM) based optimization has focused on unicast flows with sender-based utilities in either wireline or wireless networks. In this work, we develop a generalized NUM model to consider three key new features observed in mission-centric WSN environments: i) the definition of the utility of an individual mission (receiver) as a joint function of data from multiple sensor sources; ii) the consumption of each sender's (sensor) data by multiple missions; and iii) the multicast-tree-based dissemination of each sensor's data flow, using link-layer broadcasts to exploit the â\u20ACœwireless broadcast advantageâ\u20AC? in data forwarding. We show how a price-based, distributed protocol (WSN-NUM) can ensure optimal and proportionally fair rate allocation across multiple missions, without requiring any coordination among missions or sensors. We also discuss techniques to improve the speed of convergence of the protocol, which is essential in an environment as dynamic as the WSN. Further, we analyze the impact of various network and protocol parameters on the bandwidth utilization of the network, using a discrete-event simulation of a stationary wireless network. Finally, we corroborate our simulation-based performance results of the WSN-NUM protocol with an implementation of an 802.11b network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21378","fieldValue":" The inherent many-to-one flow of traffic in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) produces a skewed distribution of energy consumption rates, leading to the early demise of those sensors that are critical to the ability of surviving nodes to communicate their measurements to the base station. Numerous previous approaches aimed at balancing the consumption of energy in wireless networks are either too complex or do not address problems unique to the flow of traffic in WSNs. In this article, we propose the use of a dynamic programming algorithm (DPA), an operational, low-complexity algorithm, used in conjunction with four different route discovery algorithms. We perform complexity analysis, statistical evaluation of changes in power consumption rates effected, and verify spatial redistribution of energy consumption of sensors in the network. Our results on multihop networks of 100 randomly placed nodes show that, on average, the two best performing variants of DPA yield a reduction of up to 28&percnt; and 36&percnt; in power consumption rate variance at the cost of raising average power consumption by 15&percnt; and 21&percnt;, respectively. Computational complexities of DPA variants range from $O(N^3) to O(N4), which is significantly lower than linear search of the solution space of O(N&excl;Ni$). Analysis by diffusion plots shows that DPA reduces power consumption of sensors that experience the highest power consumption under the shortest path routes."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21378","fieldValue":"A dynamic programming approach to maximizing a statistical measure of the lifetime of sensor networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21378","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21378","fieldValue":"ACM"}
