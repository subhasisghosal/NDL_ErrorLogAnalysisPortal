However, the gate-misalignment problem resulting from process variation and the parasitic resistance resulting from interconnecting wires based on the FinFET technology becomes even more severe compared with the conventional planar CMOS technology. Such gate misalignment and unwanted parasitic resistance may increase the threshold voltage and decrease the drain current of transistors. When applying the FinFET technology to analog circuit design, the variation of drain currents can destroy current-ratio matching among transistors and degrade circuit performance. In this article, we present the first FinFET placement and routing algorithms for layout generation of a common-centroid FinFET array to precisely match the current ratios among transistors. Experimental results show that the proposed matching-driven FinFET placement and routing algorithms can obtain the best current-ratio matching compared with the state-of-the-art common-centroid placer."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13503","fieldValue":" Application-specific Network-on-Chip (ASNoC) has been proposed as a promising solution to address the global communication challenges in System-on-Chips. However, with the number of cores increasing, the on-chip communication becomes more and more complex and the power consumption imposes the major challenge for designing ASNoCs. In this article, we propose a four-stage floorplanning and topology synthesis approach for ASNoCs with Radio-Frequency Interconnect (RF-I). First, considering the advantage of RF-I in long-distance on-chip communication, we integrate the floorplanning and clustering to explore the proper clustering of cores, where the cores belonging to the same cluster will share the same switch for communications, form an island, and occupy a contiguous physical region. After the switches and network interfaces are inserted into the floorplan, the allocation of routing paths and the RF-I logical channels are integrated in an iterative procedure to generate fine-grained dynamically reconfigurable ASNoC topologies. Finally, considering the signal integrity of RF-I, we adjust the placement of the switches by a simulated annealing-based method to reduce the number of RF-I routing corners. To evaluate the placement of switches, we propose a dynamical programming-based method to route the transmission line with the minimized number of routing corners in linear time. The results show that, using the RF-I, we can reduce the power consumption of ASNoCs by 20&percnt; to 26&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13504","fieldValue":"Jiang, Iris Hui-Ru"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13504","fieldValue":" Circuit clustering is usually done through discrete optimizations to enable circuit size reduction or design-specific cluster formation. In this article, we are interested in the register-clustering technique for clock-power reduction by leveraging new opportunities introduced by multibit flip-flop (MBFF). Currently, INTEGRA is the only existing postplacement MBFF clustering optimizer with a subquadratic time complexity. However, it severely degrades the wirelength, especially for realistic designs, which may nullify the benefits of MBFF clustering. In contrast, we formulate an analytical clustering score with a nonlinear programming framework, in which the wirelength objective can be seamlessly integrated and the solver has empirical subquadratic time complexity. With the MBFF library, the application of our analytical clustering method achieves comparable clock power to the state-of-the-art techniques, but further reduces the wirelength by about 25&percnt;. Even without the MBFF library, we can still achieve 30&percnt; clock wirelength reduction. In addition, the proposed method can potentially be integrated into an in-placement MBFF clustering solver and be applied to other problems that require formulating clustering scores in their objective functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13504","fieldValue":"ACM"}
