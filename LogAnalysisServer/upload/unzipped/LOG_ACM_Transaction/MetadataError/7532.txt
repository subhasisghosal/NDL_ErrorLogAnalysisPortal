We evaluate the resequencing delay and the resequencing buffer occupancy, respectively. Under the assumption that all channels have the same transmission rate but possibly different time-invariant error rates, we derive the probability generating function of the resequencing buffer occupancy and the probability mass function of the resequencing delay. Then, by assuming the Gilbert-Elliott model for each channel, we extend our analysis to time-varying channels. Through examples, we compute the probability mass functions of the resequencing buffer occupancy and the resequencing delay for time-invariant channels. From numerical and simulation results, we analyze trends in the mean resequencing buffer occupancy and the mean resequencing delay as functions of system parameters. We expect that the modeling technique and analytical approach used in this paper can be applied to the performance evaluation of other ARQ protocols (e.g., the selective-repeat ARQ) over multiple time-varying channels."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9872","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9872","fieldValue":"SW-ARQ"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9872","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9872","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9873","fieldValue":"De Amorim, Marcelo Dias"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9873","fieldValue":" Assessing mobility in a thorough fashion is a crucial step toward more efficient mobile network design. Recent research on mobility has focused on two main points: analyzing models and studying their impact on data transport. These works investigate the consequences of mobility. In this paper, instead, we focus on the causes of mobility. Starting from established research in sociology, we propose SIMPS, a mobility model of human crowds with pedestrian motion. This model defines a process called sociostation, rendered by two complimentary behaviors, namely socialize and isolate, that regulate an individual with regard to her\/his own sociability level. SIMPS leads to results that agree with scaling laws observed both in small-scale and large-scale human motion. Although our model defines only two simple individual behaviors, we observe many emerging collective behaviors (group formation\/splitting, path formation, and evolution)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9873","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
