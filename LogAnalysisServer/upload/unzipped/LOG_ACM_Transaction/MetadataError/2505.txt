The algorithm combines bisection with second and third order methods using derivatives estimated from objective function values. Globaql convergence is ensured and the number of function evaluations is bounded by four times the number needed by bisection. Numerical comparisons with existing algorithms indicate the superiority of the new algorithm in all classes of problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2734","fieldValue":"Har-Peled, Sariel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2734","fieldValue":" Nearest-neighbor search, which returns the nearest neighbor of a query point in a set of points, is an important and widely studied problem in many fields, and it has a wide range of applications. In many of them, such as sensor databases, location-based services, face recognition, and mobile data, the location of data is imprecise. We therefore study nearest-neighbor queries in a probabilistic framework in which the location of each input point is specified as a probability distribution function. We present efficient algorithms for (i) computing all points that are nearest neighbors of a query point with nonzero probability and (ii) estimating the probability of a point being the nearest neighbor of a query point, either exactly or within a specified additive error."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18478","fieldValue":" We evaluate several sets of cyclic linear multistep formulas (CLMFs). One of these sets was derived by Tischer and Sacks-Davis. Three new sets of formulas have been derived and we present their characteristics.The formulas have been evaluated by comparing the performance of four versions of a code which implements CLMFs. The four versions are very similar and each version implements one of the sets of CLMFs being studied. We compare the performance of these codes with that of a widely used code, LSODE. One of the new sets of CLMFs is not only much more efficient in solving stiff problems that have a Jacobian with eigenvalues close to the imaginary axis but is almost as efficient as LSODE in solving other problems. This is a significant improvement over the ony other CLMF code available, STINT from Tendler, Bickart, and Picel."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18478","fieldValue":"ACM"}
