{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7706","fieldValue":" The capacity to recognize faces under varied poses is a fundamental human ability that presents a unique challenge for computer vision systems. Compared to frontal face recognition, which has been intensively studied and has gradually matured in the past few decades, Pose-Invariant Face Recognition (PIFR) remains a largely unsolved problem. However, PIFR is crucial to realizing the full potential of face recognition for real-world applications, since face recognition is intrinsically a passive biometric technology for recognizing uncooperative subjects. In this article, we discuss the inherent difficulties in PIFR and present a comprehensive review of established techniques. Existing PIFR methods can be grouped into four categories, that is, pose-robust feature extraction approaches, multiview subspace learning approaches, face synthesis approaches, and hybrid approaches. The motivations, strategies, pros\/cons, and performance of representative approaches are described and compared. Moreover, promising directions for future research are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7706","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7706","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7707","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7707","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7708","fieldValue":" Collaborative filtering (CF) models offer users personalized recommendations by measuring the relevance between the active user and each individual candidate item. Following this idea, user-based collaborative filtering (UCF) usually selects the local popular items from the like-minded neighbor users. However, these traditional relevance-based models only consider the individuals (i.e., each neighbor user and candidate item) separately during neighbor set selection and recommendation set generation, thus usually incurring highly similar recommendations that lack diversity. While many researchers have recognized the importance of diversified recommendations, the proposed solutions either needed additional semantic information of items or decreased accuracy in this process. In this article, we describe how to generate both accurate and diversified recommendations from a new perspective. Along this line, we first introduce a simple measure of coverage that quantifies the usefulness of the whole set, that is, the neighbor userset and the recommended itemset as a complete entity. Then we propose a recommendation framework named REC that considers both traditional relevance-based scores and the new coverage measure based on UCF. Under REC, we further prove that the goals of maximizing relevance and coverage measures simultaneously in both the neighbor set selection step and the recommendation set generation step are NP-hard. Luckily, we can solve them effectively and efficiently by exploiting the inherent submodular property. Furthermore, we generalize the coverage notion and the REC framework from both a data perspective and an algorithm perspective. Finally, extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets show that the REC-based recommendation models can naturally generate more diversified recommendations without decreasing accuracy compared to some state-of-the-art models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7708","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7708","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7709","fieldValue":" Social bookmarking systems have established themselves as an important part in todayâ\u20AC™s Web. In such systems, tag recommender systems support users during the posting of a resource by suggesting suitable tags. Tag recommender algorithms have often been evaluated in offline benchmarking experiments. Yet, the particular setup of such experiments has rarely been analyzed. In particular, since the recommendation quality usually suffers from difficulties such as the sparsity of the data or the cold-start problem for new resources or users, datasets have often been pruned to so-called cores (specific subsets of the original datasets), without much consideration of the implications on the benchmarking results. In this article, we generalize the notion of a core by introducing the new notion of a set-core, which is independent of any graph structure, to overcome a structural drawback in the previous constructions of cores on tagging data. We show that problems caused by some types of cores can be eliminated using set-cores. Further, we present a thorough analysis of tag recommender benchmarking setups using cores. To that end, we conduct a large-scale experiment on four real-world datasets, in which we analyze the influence of different cores on the evaluation of recommendation algorithms. We can show that the results of the comparison of different recommendation approaches depends on the selection of core type and level. For the benchmarking of tag recommender algorithms, our results suggest that the evaluation must be set up more carefully and should not be based on one arbitrarily chosen core type and level."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7709","fieldValue":"ACM"}
