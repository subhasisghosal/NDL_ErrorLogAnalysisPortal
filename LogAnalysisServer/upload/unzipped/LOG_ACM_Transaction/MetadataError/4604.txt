{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24900","fieldValue":" This research investigates the application of network simulation to enhance network management in real-time. Its focus is on ad hoc wireless networks as needed for future public safety emergency response, homeland security, and future combat system networks where the network requirements and topology are rapidly changing. The network simulation is used to analyze user satisfaction with the network and to enable real-time what-if studies that show what the user satisfaction will be if the network is reconfigured in various ways. User satisfaction as a metric is defined to correspond to the impact of the network performance on the ability of the network user to complete their public safety, security or military functions. The current network size of interest is up to ad hoc wireless 500 nodes, a typical target load for a single network manager. At the same time, the approach is made scalable to use manager of managers approach to scale to larger networks. The article reports on the approach and performance results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24901","fieldValue":"Deng, Lih-Yuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24901","fieldValue":" Deng and Xu [2003] proposed a system of multiple recursive generators of prime modulus p and order k, where all nonzero coefficients of the recurrence are equal. This type of generator is efficient because only a single multiplication is required. It is common to choose p = $2^31âˆ\u20191 and some multipliers to further improve the speed of the generator. In this case, some fast implementations are available without using explicit division or multiplication. For such a p, Deng and Xu [2003] provided specific parameters, yielding the maximum period for recurrence of order k, up to 120. One problem of extending it to a larger k is the difficulty of finding a complete factorization of pkâˆ\u20191. In this article, we apply an efficient technique to find k such that it is easy to factor pkâˆ\u20191, with p = 231âˆ\u20191. The largest one found is k = 1597. To find multiple recursive generators of large order k, we introduce an efficient search algorithm with an early exit strategy in case of a failed search. For k = 1597, we constructed several efficient and portable generators with the period length approximately 1014903.1$."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/24901","fieldValue":"DX-<i>k<\/i> generator"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24901","fieldValue":"GMP"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24901","fieldValue":"MRG"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24901","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24901","fieldValue":"ACM"}
