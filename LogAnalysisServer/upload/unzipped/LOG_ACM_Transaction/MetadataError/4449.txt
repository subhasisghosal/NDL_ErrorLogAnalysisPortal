Collaboration enables domains to effectively share resources; however, it introduces several security and privacy challenges. In this article, we use the current web service standards such as SOAP and UDDI to enable secure interoperability in a service-oriented mediator-free environment. We propose a multihop SOAP messaging protocol that enables domains to discover secure access paths to access roles in different domains. Then we propose a path authentication mechanism based on the encapsulation of SOAP messages and the SOAP-DISG standard. Furthermore, we provide a service discovery protocol that enables domains to discover service descriptions stored in private UDDI registries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3363","fieldValue":" An experiment was conducted to investigate whether human observers use knowledge of the differences in focus of attention in multiparty interaction to identify the speaker amongst the meeting participants. A virtual environment was used to have good stimulus control. Head orientations were displayed as the only cue for focus attention. The orientations were derived from a corpus of tracked head movements. We present some properties of the relation between head orientations and speaker--listener status, as found in the corpus. With respect to the experiment, it appears that people use knowledge of the patterns in focus of attention to distinguish the speaker from the listeners. However, the human speaker identification results were rather low. Head orientations (or focus of attention) alone do not provide a sufficient cue for reliable identification of the speaker in a multiparty setting."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3363","fieldValue":"Differences in head orientation behavior for speakers and listeners: An experiment in a virtual environment"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3363","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3363","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24374","fieldValue":"Lau, Rynson W H"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24374","fieldValue":"McLeod, Dennis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24374","fieldValue":"ACM"}
