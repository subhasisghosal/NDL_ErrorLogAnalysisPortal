To enable knowledge sharing and reuse, models need to be managed within repositories, where they can be retrieved upon usersâ\u20AC™ queries. This article examines two different techniques for indexing and searching model repositories, with a focus on Web development projects encoded in a domain-specific language. Keyword-based and content-based search (also known as query-by-example) are contrasted with respect to the architecture of the system, the processing of models and queries, and the way in which metamodel knowledge can be exploited to improve search. A thorough experimental evaluation is conducted to examine what parameter configurations lead to better accuracy and to offer an insight in what queries are addressed best by each system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23293","fieldValue":" User-based collaborative filtering systems suggest interesting items to a user relying on similar-minded people called neighbors. The selection and weighting of these neighbors characterize the different recommendation approaches. While standard strategies perform a neighbor selection based on user similarities, trust-aware recommendation algorithms rely on other aspects indicative of user trust and reliability. In this article we restate the trust-aware recommendation problem, generalizing it in terms of performance prediction techniques, whose goal is to predict the performance of an information retrieval system in response to a particular query. We investigate how to adopt the preceding generalization to define a unified framework where we conduct an objective analysis of the effectiveness (predictive power) of neighbor scoring functions. The proposed framework enables discriminating whether recommendation performance improvements are caused by the used neighbor scoring functions or by the ways these functions are used in the recommendation computation. We evaluated our approach with several state-of-the-art and novel neighbor scoring functions on three publicly available datasets. By empirically comparing four neighbor quality metrics and thirteen performance predictors, we found strong predictive power for some of the predictors with respect to certain metrics. This result was then validated by checking the final performance of recommendation strategies where predictors are used for selecting and\/or weighting user neighbors. As a result, we have found that, by measuring the predictive power of neighbor performance predictors, we are able to anticipate which predictors are going to perform better in neighbor-scoring-powered versions of a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23293","fieldValue":"Neighbor Selection and Weighting in User-Based Collaborative Filtering: A Performance Prediction Approach"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23293","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23293","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23294","fieldValue":" Modeling trust in very large social networks is a hard problem due to the highly noisy nature of these networks that span trust relationships from many different contexts, based on judgments of reliability, dependability, and competence. Furthermore, relationships in these networks vary in their level of strength. In this article, we introduce a novel extension of structural balance theory as a foundational theory of trust and distrust in networks. Our theory preserves the distinctions between trust and distrust as suggested in the literature, but also incorporates the notion of relationship strength that can be expressed as either discrete categorical values, as pairwise comparisons, or as metric distances. Our model is novel, has sound social and psychological basis, and captures the classical balance theory as a special case. We then propose a convergence model, describing how an imbalanced network evolves towards new balance, and formulate the convergence problem of a social network as a Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) optimization problem. Finally, we show how the convergence model can be used to predict edge signs in social networks and justify our theory through extensive experiments on real datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23294","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23294","fieldValue":"ACM"}
