{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10208","fieldValue":" In response to the high throughput needs of grid and cloud computing applications, several production networks have recently started to support advance reservation of dedicated circuits. An important open problem within this context is to devise advance reservation algorithms that can provide provable throughput performance guarantees independently of the specific network topology and arrival pattern of reservation requests. In this paper, we first show that the throughput performance of greedy approaches, which return the earliest possible completion time for each incoming request, can be arbitrarily worse than optimal. Next, we introduce two new online, polynomial-time algorithms for advance reservation, called BatchAll and BatchLim. Both algorithms are shown to be throughput-optimal through the derivation of delay bounds for 1 + Îµ bandwidth augmented networks. The BatchLim algorithm has the advantage of returning the completion time of a connection immediately as a request is placed, but at the expense of looser delay performance than Batch All. We then propose a simple approach that limits path dispersion, i.e., the number of parallel paths used by the algorithms, while provably bounding the maximum reduction factor in the transmission throughput. We prove that the number of paths needed to approximate any flow is quite small and never exceeds the total number of edges in the network. Through simulation for various topologies and traffic parameters, we show that the proposed algorithms achieve reasonable delay performance, even at request arrival rates close to capacity bounds, and that three to five parallel paths are sufficient to achieve near-optimal performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10208","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10208","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10208","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10209","fieldValue":" A cross-layer design along with an optimal resource allocation framework is formulated for wireless fading networks, where the nodes are allowed to perform network coding. The aim is to jointly optimize end-to-end transport-layer rates, network code design variables, broadcast link flows, link capacities, average power consumption, and short-term power allocation policies. As in the routing paradigm where nodes simply forward packets, the cross-layer optimization problem with network coding is nonconvex in general. It is proved, however, that with network coding, dual decomposition for multicast is optimal so long as the fading at each wireless link is a continuous random variable. This lends itself to provably convergent subgradient algorithms, which not only admit a layered-architecture interpretation, but also optimally integrate network coding in the protocol stack. The dual algorithm is also paired with a scheme that yields near-optimal network design variables, namely multicast end-to-end rates, network code design quantities, flows over the broadcast links, link capacities, and average power consumption. Finally, an asynchronous subgradient method is developed, whereby the dual updates at the physical layer can be affordably performed with a certain delay with respect to the resource allocation tasks in upper layers. This attractive feature is motivated by the complexity of the physical-layer subproblem and is an adaptation of the subgradient method suitable for network control."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10209","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10209","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10209","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10210","fieldValue":" Users of the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol and its variants are incentivized to contribute their upload capacity in a bilateral manner: Downloading is possible in return for uploading to the same user. An alternative is to use multilateral exchange to match user demand for content to available supply at other users in the system. We provide a formal comparison of peer-to-peer system designs based on bilateral exchange with those that enable multilateral exchange via a price-based market mechanism to match supply and demand. First, we compare the two types of exchange in terms of the equilibria that arise. A multilateral equilibrium allocation is Pareto-efficient, while we demonstrate that bilateral equilibrium allocations are not Pareto-efficient in general. We show that Pareto efficiency represents the \"gap\" between bilateral and multilateral equilibria: A bilateral equilibrium allocation corresponds to a multilateral equilibrium allocation if and only if it is Pareto-efficient. Our proof exploits the fact that Pareto efficiency implies reversibility of an appropriately constructed Markov chain. Second, we compare the two types of exchange through the expected percentage of users that can trade in a large system, assuming a fixed file popularity distribution. Our theoretical results as well as analysis of a BitTorrent dataset provide quantitative insight into regimes where bilateral exchange may perform quite well even though it does not always give rise to Pareto-efficient equilibrium allocations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10210","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
