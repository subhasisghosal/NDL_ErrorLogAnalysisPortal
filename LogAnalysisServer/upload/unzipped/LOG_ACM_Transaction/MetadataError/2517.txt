{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2738","fieldValue":" In computing, as in many aspects of life, changes incur cost. Many optimization problems are formulated as a one-time instance starting from scratch. However, a common case that arises is when we already have a set of prior assignments and must decide how to respond to a new set of constraints, given that each change from the current assignment comes at a price. That is, we would like to maximize the fitness or efficiency of our system, but we need to balance it with the changeout cost from the previous state. We provide a precise formulation for this tradeoff and analyze the resulting stable extensions of some fundamental problems in measurement and analytics. Our main technical contribution is a stable extension of Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) weighted random sampling, with applications to monitoring and anomaly detection problems. We also provide a general framework that applies to top-k, minimum spanning tree, and assignment. In both cases, we are able to provide exact solutions and discuss efficient incremental algorithms that can find new solutions as the input changes."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2738","fieldValue":"Stable top-<i>k<\/i>"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18513","fieldValue":" The exponential function presented here returns a result which differs from $e^x by less than one unit in the last place, for any representable value of x which is not too close to values for which ex$ would overflow or underflow. (For values of x which are not within this range, an error condition is raised.) It is a variable precision function in that it returns a p-digit approximation for a p-digit argument, for any p = 0 (p-digit means p-decimal-digit). The program and analysis are valid for all p = 0, but current implementations place a restriction on p. The program is presented in a Pascal-like programming language called Numerical Turing which has special facilities for scientific computing, including precision control, directed roundings, and built-in functions for getting and setting exponents."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18514","fieldValue":" This paper examines mathematical programming software in the context of model management and decision support. The concept of a model management system (MMS) is introduced and compared to traditional modeling systems. An MMS is seen as a much more generalized software system that requires the confluence of existing operations research, database management, and artificial intelligence techniques. By incorporating powerful, abstraction-based representation structures, an MMS can support multiple levels of model abstraction, only one of which corresponds to traditional, solution-oriented modeling software. The database structures required to implement a knowledge-based MMS are discussed and a prototype system for mathematical programming, the Generalized eXperimental Math Programming system (GXMP), is described. An algebraic language developed for use in GXMP is described in detail."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18514","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18514","fieldValue":"ACM"}
