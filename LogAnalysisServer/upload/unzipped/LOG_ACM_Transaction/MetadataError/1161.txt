In this article we describe a comprehensive framework for R-KWS covering snapshot queries on conventional tables and continuous queries on relational streams. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (i) We provide formal semantics, addressing the temporal validity and order of results, spanning uniformly over tables and streams; (ii) we investigate two general methodologies for query processing, graph based and operator based, that resolve several problems of previous approaches; and (iii) we develop a range of algorithms and optimizations covering both methodologies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-KWS, as well as the significant performance benefits of the proposed techniques, through extensive experiments with static and streaming datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14488","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14488","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14489","fieldValue":" Constraints are important, not only for maintaining data integrity, but also because they capture natural probabilistic dependencies among data items. A probabilistic XML database (PXDB) is the probability subspace comprising the instances of a p-document that satisfy a set of constraints. In contrast to existing models that can express probabilistic dependencies, it is shown that query evaluation is tractable in PXDBs. The problems of sampling and determining well-definedness (i.e., whether the aforesaid subspace is nonempty) are also tractable. Furthermore, queries and constraints can include the aggregate functions count, max, min, and ratio. Finally, this approach can be easily extended to allow a probabilistic interpretation of constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2377","fieldValue":" In this article, we present two approximation algorithms for the maximum constraint satisfaction problem with k variables in each constraint (MAX k-CSP). Given a (1 âˆ\u2019 &epsiv;) satisfiable 2CSP our first algorithm finds an assignment of variables satisfying a 1 âˆ\u2019 O(&sqrt;&epsiv;) fraction of all constraints. The best previously known result, due to Zwick, was 1 âˆ\u2019 $O(&epsiv;^1\/3). The second algorithm finds a ck\/2k approximation for the MAX k-CSP problem (where c > 0.44 is an absolute constant). This result improves the previously best known algorithm by Hast, which had an approximation guarantee of Î©(k\/(2k$ log k)). Both results are optimal assuming the unique games conjecture and are based on rounding natural semidefinite programming relaxations. We also believe that our algorithms and their analysis are simpler than those previously known."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2377","fieldValue":"SDP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2377","fieldValue":"ACM"}
