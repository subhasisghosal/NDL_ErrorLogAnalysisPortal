[2013] within the framework of relational transducer networks, asserts that a query has a coordination-free execution strategy if and only if the query is monotone. Zinn et al. [2012] extended the framework of relational transducer networks to allow for specific data distribution strategies and showed that the nonmonotone win-move query is coordination-free for domain-guided data distributions. In this article, we extend the story by equating increasingly larger classes of coordination-free computations with increasingly weaker forms of monotonicity and present explicit Datalog variants that capture each of these classes. One such fragment is based on stratified Datalog where rules are required to be connected with the exception of the last stratum. In addition, we characterize coordination-freeness as those computations that do not require knowledge about all other nodes in the network, and therefore, can not globally coordinate. The results in this article can be interpreted as a more fine-grained answer to the CALM-conjecture."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14670","fieldValue":"Weaker Forms of Monotonicity for Declarative Networking: A More Fine-Grained Answer to the CALM-Conjecture"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14670","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14670","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14671","fieldValue":"Ten Cate, Balder"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14671","fieldValue":" We present algorithms for answering queries making use of information about source integrity constraints, access restrictions, and access costs. Our method can exploit the integrity constraints to find plans even when there is no direct access to relations appearing in the query. We look at different kinds of plans, depending on the kind of relational operators that are permitted within their commands. To each type of plan, we associate a semantic property that is necessary for having a plan of that type. The key idea of our method is to move from a search for a plan to a search for a proof of the corresponding semantic property, and then generate a plan from a proof. We provide algorithms for converting proofs to plans and show that they will find a plan of the desired type whenever such a plan exists. We show that while discovery of one proof allows us to find a single plan that answers the query, we can explore alternative proofs to find lower-cost plans."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14672","fieldValue":" Top-k dominating queries combine the natural idea of selecting the k best items with a comprehensive â\u20ACœgoodnessâ\u20AC? criterion based on dominance. A point $p_1 dominates p2 if p1 is as good as p2$ in all attributes and is strictly better in at least one. Existing works address the problem in settings where data objects are multidimensional points. However, there are domains where we only have access to the distance between two objects. In cases like these, attributes reflect distances from a set of input objects and are dynamically generated as the input objects change. Consequently, prior works from the literature cannot be applied, despite the fact that the dominance relation is still meaningful and valid. For this reason, in this work, we present the first study for processing top-k dominating queries over distance-based dynamic attribute vectors, defined over a metric space. We propose four progressive algorithms that utilize the properties of the underlying metric space to efficiently solve the problem and present an extensive, comparative evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets."}
