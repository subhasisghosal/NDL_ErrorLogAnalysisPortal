The efficiency of the BLAS, as standard available on the CDC Cyber 205, has been examined, and suggestions for improvements were given. This examination has led to the vectorized BLAS as presented here. Moreover, this version admits negative increment values; that is, vectors can also be treated in reverse order. The number of data movements has been kept to a minimum. This BLAS version has been written in CDC FORTRAN 200. It has been optimized for a 1-pipe Cyber 205, but is also appropriate for the 2- and 4-pipe versions."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18588","fieldValue":"Algorithm 663: Translation of Algorithm 539: basic linear algebra subprograms for FORTRAN usage in FORTRAN 200 for the Cyber 205"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18588","fieldValue":"ACM"}
