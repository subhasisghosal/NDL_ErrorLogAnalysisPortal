In this article, we show that for certain classes of theories, this semantics fails to identify the unique intended model. We solve this problem by refining the well-founded semantics. We develop our work in approximation fixpoint theory, an abstract algebraical study of semantics of nonmonotonic logics. As such, our results also apply to logic programming, default logic, Dungâ\u20AC™s argumentation frameworks, and abstract dialectical frameworks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11795","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11795","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11796","fieldValue":" Binary multirelations generalise binary relations by associating elements of a set to its subsets. We study the structure and algebra of multirelations under the operations of union, intersection, sequential, and parallel composition, as well as finite and infinite iteration. Starting from a set-theoretic investigation, we propose axiom systems for multirelations in contexts ranging from bi-monoids to bi-quantales."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11796","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11796","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11797","fieldValue":" Homotopy type theory is a new branch of mathematics that merges insights from abstract homotopy theory and higher category theory with those of logic and type theory. It allows us to represent a variety of mathematical objects as basic type-theoretic construction, higher inductive types. We present a proof that in homotopy type theory, the torus is equivalent to the product of two circles. This result indicates that the synthetic definition of torus as a higher inductive type is indeed correct."}
