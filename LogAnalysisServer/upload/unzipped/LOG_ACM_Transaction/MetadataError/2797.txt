These types of problems arise in electronic structure calculations, which are nowadays essential for studying the microscopic quantum mechanical properties of molecules, solids, and other nanoscale materials. KSSOLV is well suited for developing new algorithms for solving the Kohn-Sham equations and is designed to enable researchers in computational and applied mathematics to investigate the convergence properties of the existing algorithms. The toolbox makes use of the object-oriented programming features available in MATLAB so that the process of setting up a physical system is straightforward and the amount of coding effort required to prototype, test, and compare new algorithms is significantly reduced. All of these features should also make this package attractive to other computational scientists and students who wish to study small- to medium-size systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19245","fieldValue":" The minimal block storage Distributed Square Block Packed (DSBP) format for distributed memory computing on symmetric and triangular matrices is presented. Three algorithm variants (Basic, Static, and Dynamic) of the blocked right-looking Cholesky factorization are designed for the DSBP format, implemented, and evaluated. On our target machine, all variants outperform standard full-storage implementations while saving almost half the storage. Communication overhead is shown to be virtually eliminated by the Static and Dynamic variants, both of which take advantage of hardware parallelism to hide communication costs. The Basic variant is shown to yield comparable or slightly better performance than the full-storage ScaLAPACK routine PDPOTRF while clearly outperformed by both Static and Dynamic. Models of execution assuming zero communication costs and overhead are developed. For medium- and larger-sized problems, the Static schedule is near optimal on our target machine based on comparisons with these models and measurements of synchronization overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19246","fieldValue":" FORTRAN 95 software is provided for computing the matrix values of &phiv;-functions required in exponential integrators. The subroutines in the library accept as their argument a full, diagonal, or upper quasitriangular matrix with real or complex entries in one of four precisions. Two different algorithms are implemented, one is the scaling and squaring method, and the other is a modified block Schur--Parlett algorithm. In the latter algorithm, a recursive three-by-three blocking is applied to the argument based on an estimate of the sep-inverse function. The estimation of the sep-inverse function is carried out by Hager--Higham estimator implemented as the subroutine xLACON in LAPACK. Our modifications to the block Schur--Parlett algorithm are described together with the results of numerical experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19246","fieldValue":"&phiv;-functions"}
