In such an auction, a set of utility maximizing advertisers competes for a set of ad slots. The assignment of advertisers to slots depends on the bids they submit; these bids may be different than the true valuations of the advertisers for the slots. Variants of the celebrated VCG auction mechanism guarantee that advertisers act truthfully and, under some assumptions, lead to revenue or social welfare maximization. Still, the sponsored search industry mostly uses generalized second price (GSP) auctions; these auctions are known to be nontruthful and suboptimal in terms of social welfare and revenue. In an attempt to explain this tradition, we study a Bayesian setting wherein the valuations of advertisers are drawn independently from a common regular probability distribution. In this setting, it is well known from the work of Myerson [1981] that the optimal revenue is obtained by the VCG mechanism with a particular reserve price that depends on the probability distribution. We show that, by appropriately setting the reserve price, the revenue over any Bayes-Nash equilibrium of the game induced by the GSP auction is at most a small constant factor away from the optimal revenue, improving previous results of Lucier et al. [2012]. Our analysis is based on the Bayes-Nash equilibrium conditions and the improved results are obtained by bounding the utility of each player at equilibrium using infinitely many deviating bids and also by developing novel prophet-like inequalities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24482","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24482","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24483","fieldValue":" Price of anarchy is an oft-used worst-case measure of the inefficiency of noncooperative decentralized architectures. For a noncooperative load-balancing game with two classes of servers and for a finite or infinite number of dispatchers, we show that the price of anarchy is an overly pessimistic measure that does not reflect the performance obtained in most instances of the problem. We explicitly characterize the worst-case traffic conditions for the efficiency of noncooperative load-balancing schemes and show that, contrary to a common belief, the worst inefficiency is in general not achieved in heavy traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24484","fieldValue":" We develop a formal nondeterministic game model for secure team composition to counter cyber-espionage and to protect organizational secrets against an attacker who tries to sidestep technical security mechanisms by offering a bribe to a project team member. The game captures the adversarial interaction between the attacker and the project manager who has a secret she wants to protect but must share with a team of individuals selected from within her organization. Our interdisciplinary work is important in the face of the multipronged approaches utilized by well-motivated attackers to circumvent the fortifications of otherwise well-defended targets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24484","fieldValue":"ACM"}
