{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25738","fieldValue":" The availability of intelligent image editing techniques and antiforensic algorithms, make it convenient to manipulate an image and to hide the artifacts that it might have produced in the process. Real world forgeries are generally followed by the application of enhancement techniques such as filtering and\/or conversion of the image format to suppress the forgery artifacts. Though several techniques evolved in the direction of detecting some of these manipulations, additional operations like recompression, nonlinear filtering, and other antiforensic methods during forgery are not deeply investigated. Toward this, we propose a robust method to detect whether a given image has undergone filtering (linear or nonlinear) based enhancement, possibly followed by format conversion after forgery. In the proposed method, JPEG quantization noise is obtained using natural image prior and quantization noise models. Transition probability features extracted from the quantization noise are used for machine learning based detection and classification. We test the effectiveness of the algorithm in classifying the class of the filter applied and the efficacy in detecting filtering in low resolution images. Experiments are performed to compare the performance of the proposed technique with state-of-the-art forensic filtering detection algorithms. It is found that the proposed technique is superior in most of the cases. Also, experiments against popular antiforensic algorithms show the counter antiforensic robustness of the proposed technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25738","fieldValue":"GMM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25738","fieldValue":"HMRF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25739","fieldValue":" Signal processing in the encrypted domain becomes a desired technique to protect privacy of outsourced data in cloud. In this article, we propose a double-cipher scheme to implement nonlocal means (NLM) denoising in encrypted images. In this scheme, one ciphertext is generated by the Paillier scheme, which enables the mean filter, and the other is obtained by a privacy-preserving transform, which enables the nonlocal search. By the privacy-preserving transform, the cloud server can search the similar pixel blocks in the ciphertexts with the same speed as in the plaintexts; thus, the proposed method can be executed fast. To enhance the security, we randomly permutate both ciphertexts. To reduce the denoising complexity caused by random permutation, a random NLM method is exploited in the encrypted domain. The experimental results show that the quality of denoised images in the encrypted domain is comparable to that obtained in the plain domain."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25739","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25739","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25740","fieldValue":" Current three-dimensional displays cannot fully reproduce all depth cues used by a human observer in the real world. Instead, they create only an illusion of looking at a three-dimensional scene. This leads to a number of challenges during the content creation process. To assure correct depth reproduction and visual comfort, either the acquisition setup has to be carefully controlled or additional postprocessing techniques have to be applied. Furthermore, these manipulations need to account for a particular setup that is used to present the content, for example, viewing distance or screen size. This creates additional challenges in the context of personal use when stereoscopic content is shown on TV sets, desktop monitors, or mobile devices. We address this problem by presenting a new system for streaming stereoscopic content. Its key feature is a computationally efficient depth adjustment technique which can automatically optimize viewing experience for videos of field sports such as soccer, football, and tennis. Additionally, the method enables depth personalization to allow users to adjust the amount of depth according to their preferences. Our stereoscopic video streaming system was implemented, deployed, and tested with real users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25740","fieldValue":"ACM"}
