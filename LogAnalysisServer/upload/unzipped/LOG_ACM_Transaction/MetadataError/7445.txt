There are many real networks that follow this model, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), etc. In this context, conventional routing schemes would fail, because they try to establish complete end-to-end paths, before any data is sent. To deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes. While flooding-based schemes have a high probability of delivery, they waste a lot of energy and suffer from severe contention which can significantly degrade their performance. With this in mind, we look into a number of \"single-copy\" routing schemes that use only one copy per message, and hence significantly reduce the resource requirements of flooding-based algorithms. We perform a detailed exploration of the single-copy routing space in order to identify efficient single-copy solutions that (i) can be employed when low resource usage is critical, and (ii) can help improve the design of general routing schemes that use multiple copies. We also propose a theoretical framework that we use to analyze the performance of all single-copy schemes presented, and to derive upper and lower bounds on the delay of any scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9702","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9702","fieldValue":"ACM"}
