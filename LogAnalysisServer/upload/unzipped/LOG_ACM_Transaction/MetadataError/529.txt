{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2211","fieldValue":" The data migration problem is to compute an efficient plan for moving data stored on devices in a network from one configuration to another. We consider this problem with the objective of minimizing the sum of completion times of all storage devices. It is modeled by a transfer graph, where vertices represent the storage devices, and the edges indicate the data transfers required between pairs of devices. Each vertex has a nonnegative weight, and each edge has a release time and a processing time. A vertex completes when all the edges incident on it complete; the constraint is that two edges incident on the same vertex cannot be processed simultaneously. The objective is to minimize the sum of weighted completion times of all vertices. Kim (Journal of Algorithms, 55:42--57, 2005) gave a 9-approximation algorithm for the problem when edges have arbitrary processing times and are released at time zero. We improve Kim's result by giving a 5.06-approximation algorithm. We also address the open shop scheduling problem, $O&verbar;r_j&verbar; âˆ\u2018wjCj$, and show that it is a special case of the data migration problem. Queyranne and Sviridenko (Journal of Scheduling, 5:287-305, 2002) gave a 5.83-approximation algorithm for the nonpreemptive version of the open shop problem. They state as an obvious open question whether there exists an algorithm for open shop scheduling that gives a performance guarantee better than 5.83. Our 5.06 algorithm for data migration proves the existence of such an algorithm. Crucial to our improved result is a property of the linear programming relaxation for the problem. Similar linear programs have been used for various other scheduling problems. Our technique may be useful in obtaining improved results for these problems as well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2211","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2211","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12734","fieldValue":" With the increasing density of VLSI circuits, the interconnection wires are being packed even closer. This has increased the effect of interaction among these wires on circuit performance and hence, the importance of controlling crosstalk. In this article, we consider river routing with crosstalk constraints. Given the positions of the pins in a single-layer routing channel and the maximum tolerable crosstalk between each pair of neighboring nets, we give a polynomial time algorithm to decide whether there is a feasible river routing solution and produce one with minimum crosstalk when it is feasible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12735","fieldValue":"McGeer, R."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12735","fieldValue":"Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, A."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12735","fieldValue":" We present an application of the JavaTM programming language to specify and implement reactive real-time systems.
