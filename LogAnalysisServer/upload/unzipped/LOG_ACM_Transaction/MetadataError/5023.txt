The conventional joint density Gaussian mixture model (JDGMM) based spectral conversion methods perform stably and effectively. However, the speech generated by these methods suffer severe quality degradation due to the following two factors: 1) inadequacy of JDGMM in modeling the distribution of spectral features as well as the non-linear mapping relationship between the source and target speakers, 2) spectral detail loss caused by the use of high-level spectral features such as mel-cepstra. Previously, we have proposed to use the mixture of restricted Boltzmann machines (MoRBM) and the mixture of Gaussian bidirectional associative memories (MoGBAM) to cope with these problems. In this paper, we propose to use a DNN to construct a global non-linear mapping relationship between the spectral envelopes of two speakers. The proposed DNN is generatively trained by cascading two RBMs, which model the distributions of spectral envelopes of source and target speakers respectively, using a Bernoulli BAM (BBAM). Therefore, the proposed training method takes the advantage of the strong modeling ability of RBMs in modeling the distribution of spectral envelopes and the superiority of BAMs in deriving the conditional distributions for conversion. Careful comparisons and analysis among the proposed method and some conventional methods are presented in this paper. The subjective results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance in terms of both similarity and naturalness compared to conventional methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3727","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3727","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3728","fieldValue":"DAngelo, Stefano"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3728","fieldValue":" One of the most critical aspects of virtual analog simulation of circuits for music production consists in accurate reproduction of their nonlinear behavior, yet this goal is in many cases difficult to achieve due to the presence of implicit differential equations in circuit models, since they naturally map to delay-free loops in the digital domain. This paper presents a novel and general method for non-iteratively implementing these loops in such a way that the linear response around a chosen operating point is preserved, the topology is minimally affected, and transformation of nonlinearities is not required. This technique is then applied to a generalized model of the Moog ladder filter, resulting in an implementation that outperforms its predecessors with only a modest computational load penalty. This digital version of the filter is shown to offer strong stability guarantees w.r.t. parameter variation, allows the extraction of different frequency response modes by simple mixing of individual ladder stage outputs, and is suitable for real-time sound synthesis and audio effects processing."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3728","fieldValue":"Generalized Moog ladder filter: part II-explicit nonlinear model through a novel delay-free loop implementation method"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3728","fieldValue":"ACM"}
