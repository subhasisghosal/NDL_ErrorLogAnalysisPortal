Such data are needed in designing haptic rendering algorithms where force direction, as well as force magnitude, are used to encode information such as surface topography. Given that haptic information is typically presented in addition to visual information in a data perceptualization system, it is also important to investigate the extent to which the congruency of visual information affects force-direction discrimination. In this article, the authors report an experiment on the discrimination threshold of force directions under the three display conditions of haptics alone (H), haptics plus congruent vision (HVcong), and haptics plus incongruent vision (HVincong). Average force-direction discrimination thresholds were found to be 18.4Â°, 25.6Â°, and 31.9Â° for the HVcong, H and HVincong conditions, respectively. The results show that the congruency of visual information significantly affected haptic discrimination of force directions, and that the force-direction discrimination thresholds did not seem to depend on the reference force direction. The implications of the results for designing haptic virtual environments, especially when the numbers of sensors and actuators in a haptic display do not match, are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3273","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3273","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23299","fieldValue":"Mazon, Jose-Norberto"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23299","fieldValue":" BACKGROUND. The term Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) is generally associated with Web applications that provide the features and functionality of traditional desktop applications. Ten years after the introduction of the term, an ample amount of research has been carried out to study various aspects of RIAs. It has thus become essential to summarize this research and provide an adequate overview. OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study is to assemble, classify, and analyze all RIA research performed in the scientific community, thus providing a consolidated overview thereof, and to identify well-established topics, trends, and open research issues. Additionally, we provide a qualitative discussion of the most interesting findings. This work therefore serves as a reference work for beginning and established RIA researchers alike, as well as for industrial actors that need an introduction in the field, or seek pointers to (a specific subset of) the state-of-the-art. METHOD. A systematic mapping study is performed in order to identify all RIA-related publications, define a classification scheme, and categorize, analyze, and discuss the identified research according to it. RESULTS. Our source identification phase resulted in 133 relevant, peer-reviewed publications, published between 2002 and 2011 in a wide variety of venues. They were subsequently classified according to four facets: development activity, research topic, contribution type, and research type. Pie, stacked bar, and bubble charts were used to depict and analyze the results. A deeper analysis is provided for the most interesting and\/or remarkable results. CONCLUSION. Analysis of the results shows that, although the RIA term was coined in 2002, the first RIA-related research appeared in 2004. From 2007 there was a significant increase in research activity, peaking in 2009 and decreasing to pre-2009 levels afterwards. All development phases are covered in the identified research, with emphasis on â\u20ACœdesignâ\u20AC? (33&percnt;) and â\u20ACœimplementationâ\u20AC? (29&percnt;). The majority of research proposes a â\u20ACœmethodâ\u20AC? (44&percnt;), followed by â\u20ACœmodelâ\u20AC? (22&percnt;), â\u20ACœmethodologyâ\u20AC? (18&percnt;), and â\u20ACœtoolsâ\u20AC? (16&percnt;); no publications in the category â\u20ACœmetricsâ\u20AC? were found. The preponderant research topic is â\u20ACœmodels, methods and methodologiesâ\u20AC? (23&percnt;) and, to a lesser extent, â\u20ACœusability and accessibilityâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœuser interfaceâ\u20AC? (11&percnt; each). On the other hand, the topic â\u20ACœlocalization, internationalization and multilingualityâ\u20AC? received no attention at all, and topics such as â\u20ACœdeep Webâ\u20AC? (under 1&percnt;), â\u20ACœbusiness processingâ\u20AC?, â\u20ACœusage analysisâ\u20AC?, â\u20ACœdata managementâ\u20AC?, â\u20ACœquality and metricsâ\u20AC? (all under 2&percnt;), â\u20ACœsemanticsâ\u20AC?, and â\u20ACœperformanceâ\u20AC? (slightly above 2&percnt;) received very little attention. Finally, there is a large majority of â\u20ACœsolution proposalsâ\u20AC? (66&percnt;), few â\u20ACœevaluation researchâ\u20AC? (14&percnt;), and even fewer â\u20ACœvalidationâ\u20AC? (6&percnt;), although the latter have been increasing in recent years."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23300","fieldValue":"Jourdan, Guy-Vincent"}
