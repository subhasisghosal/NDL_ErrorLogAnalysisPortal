{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5523","fieldValue":" This article investigates working-memory (WM) failure in phone-based interaction (PBI). We used a computational model of phone-based interaction (PBI USER) to generate predictions about the impact of three factors on WM failure:PBI features (i.e. menu structure), individual differences (i.e., WM capacity), and task characteristics (i.e., number of tasks). Our computational model stipulates that both the storage and the processing of information contribute to WM failure. In practical terms the model and the empirical results indicate that, contrary to guidelines for the design of phone-based interfaces, deep menu hierarchies (no more than three options per menu) do not reduce WM error rates in PBI. At a more theoretical level, the study shows that the use of a computational model in HCI research provides a systematic approach for explaining complex empirical results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5524","fieldValue":" The focal point of many interactive systems is an information artifact being created and manipulated by one or more users through a user interface. The software components of such an interactive system perform their tasks relative to the data structures that represent the information artifact. System components interact with each other by changing these data and responding when relevant changes are made to them by other components. Perhaps the most difficult problem to be solved when building such data-centric systems is the monitoring problem. System components require the ability to watch for and respond to changes made to complex data structures. Previous monitoring approaches are geared toward monitoring single data items rather than entire data structures. This article describes an new monitoring approach called Nanites that is designed to simplify the task of monitoring complex data structures."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5524","fieldValue":"CSCW"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5524","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5524","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5525","fieldValue":" Communication theories and technology have tended to focus on extended, formal meetings and have neglected a prevalent and vital form of workplace communicationâ\u20AC\u201Dnamely, lightweight communication. Unlike formal, extended meetings, lightweight interaction is brief, informal, unplanned, and intermittent. We analyze naturalistic data from a study of work-place communication and derive five design criteria for lightweight interaction systems. These criteria require that systems for lightweight interaction support conversational tracking, rapid connection, the ability to leave a message, context management, and shared real-time objects. Using these criteria, we evaluate existing interpersonal communications technologies. We then describe an implementation of a system (TeleNotes) that is designed to support lightweight interaction by meeting these criteria. The interface metaphor allows communications to be based around desktop objects, resembling â\u20ACœsticky notes.â\u20AC? These objects are also organized into â\u20ACœdesktop pilesâ\u20AC? to support conversational threads and provide mechanisms for initiating real-time audio, video, and application sharing. We conducted informal user testing of several system prototypes. Based on our findings, outstanding issues concerning theory and systems design for communication systems are outlinedâ\u20AC\u201Din particular, with regard to the issue of managing conversations over time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5525","fieldValue":"ACM"}
