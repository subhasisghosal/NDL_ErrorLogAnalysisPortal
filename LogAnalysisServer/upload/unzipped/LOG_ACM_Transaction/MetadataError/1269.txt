Yet illicit expressions containing terms like P + Q, cP, P X Q, etc. often appear in graphics textbooks, papers, and programs. In this paper we justify the use of such illicit expressions, and we we give criteria for recognizing when such an expression is truly legitimate. In particular we show that an algebraic expression E(P1, â\u20AC¦, Pn) is legitimate if and onl y if E(v1 + w, â\u20AC¦vn + w) = E(v1, â\u20AC¦, vn) + kw, k + 0, 1.
