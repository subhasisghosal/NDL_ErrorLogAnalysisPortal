This trend can create a new paradigm of flexible pricing schemes. A simple pricing scheme is to allocate multiple isolated service classes with differentiated prices, namely Paris Metro Pricing (PMP). The benefits of PMP are its simplicity and applicability to a wide variety of general digital services, without considering specific performance guarantees for different service classes. The central issue of our study is whether PMP is economically viable, namely whether it will produce more profit for the service provider and whether it will achieve more social welfare. Prior studies had only considered specific models and arrived at conflicting conclusions. In this article, we identify unifying principles in a general setting and derive general sufficient conditions that can guarantee the viability of PMP. We further apply the results to analyze various examples of digital services."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24478","fieldValue":"de Oliveira, Jaudelice C."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24478","fieldValue":" The goal of this article is to develop a principled understanding of when it is beneficial to bundle technologies or services whose value is heavily dependent on the size of their user base, that is, exhibits positive exernalities. Of interest is how the joint distribution, and in particular the correlation, of the values users assign to components of a bundle affect its odds of success. The results offer insight and guidelines for deciding when bundling new Internet technologies or services can help improve their overall adoption. In particular, successful outcomes appear to require a minimum level of value correlation.

It is part of the reason why music is interesting to listen to and sounds alive. Previous work on the analysis of acoustical features yielded relevant features for the recognition of different expressive intentions, inspired both by emotional and sensorial adjectives. In this article, machine learning techniques are employed to understand how expressive performances represented by the selected features are clustered on a low-dimensional space, and to define a measure of acoustical similarity. Being that expressive intentions are similar according to the features used for the recognition, and since recognition implies subjective evaluation, we hypothesized that performances are similar also from a perceptual point of view. We then compared and integrated the clustering of acoustical features with the results of two listening experiments. A first experiment aims at verifying whether subjects can distinguish different categories of expressive intentions, and a second experiment aims at understanding which expressions are perceptually clustered together in order to derive common evaluation criteria adopted by listeners, and to obtain the perceptual organization of affective and sensorial expressive intentions. An interpretation of the resulting spatial representation based on action is proposed and discussed."}
