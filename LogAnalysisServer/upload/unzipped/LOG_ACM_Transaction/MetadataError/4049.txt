In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparative evaluation of the main automatic text summarization methods based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), claimed to be among the best ones. We compare our results to superficial summarizers, which belong to a paradigm with severe limitations, and to hybrid methods, combining RST and superficial methods. We also test voting systems and machine learning techniques trained on RST features. We run experiments for English and Brazilian Portuguese languages and compare the results obtained by using manually and automatically parsed texts. Our results systematically show that all RST methods have comparable overall performance and that they outperform most of the superficial methods. Machine learning techniques achieved high accuracy in the classification of text segments worth of being in the summary, but were not able to produce more informative summaries than the regular RST methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23048","fieldValue":" Current research in text mining favors the quantity of texts over their representativeness. But for bilingual terminology mining, and for many language pairs, large comparable corpora are not available. More importantly, as terms are defined vis-Ã -vis a specific domain with a restricted register, it is expected that the representativeness rather than the quantity of the corpus matters more in terminology mining. Our hypothesis, therefore, is that the representativeness of the corpus is more important than the quantity and ensures the quality of the acquired terminological resources. This article tests this hypothesis on a French-Japanese bilingual term extraction task. To demonstrate how important the type of discourse is as a characteristic of the comparable corpora, we used a state-of-the-art multilingual terminology mining chain composed of two extraction programs, one in each language, and an alignment program. We evaluated the candidate translations using a reference list, and found that taking discourse type into account resulted in candidate translations of a better quality even when the corpus size was reduced by half."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23048","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23048","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23049","fieldValue":"El-Beltagy, Samhaa R."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23049","fieldValue":" Stemming is a key step in most text mining and information retrieval applications. Information extraction, semantic annotation, as well as ontology learning are but a few examples where using a stemmer is a must. While the use of light stemmers in Arabic texts has proven highly effective for the task of information retrieval, this class of stemmers falls short of providing the accuracy required by many text mining applications. This can be attributed to the fact that light stemmers employ a set of rules that they apply indiscriminately and that they do not address stemming of broken plurals at all, even though this class of plurals is very commonly used in Arabic texts. The goal of this work is to overcome these limitations. The evaluation of the work shows that it significantly improves stemming accuracy. It also shows that by improving stemming accuracy, tasks such as automatic annotation and keyphrase extraction can also be significantly improved."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23049","fieldValue":"ACM"}
