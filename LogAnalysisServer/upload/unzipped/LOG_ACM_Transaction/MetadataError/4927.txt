Such a system can dynamically adjust the quality of a video stream during its playback depending on the available network throughput. Even if the necessary throughput is available, mobile users can benefit from limiting the generated data traffic as most cellular network contracts have data caps. Usually, if the cap is reached, the throughput is throttled to a speed that does not allow video streaming. Existing systems react to varying network conditions but often neglect content-specific adaptation needs. Content inspection can help to save data traffic when a higher bitrate representation would not increase the perceived quality. In this work, we present the Video Adaptation Service (VAS), a support service for a content-aware video adaptation for mobile devices. Based on the video content, the adaptation process is improved for both the available network resources and the perception of the user. By leveraging the content properties of a video stream, the system is able to maintain a stable video quality and at the same time reduce the generated data traffic. The system is evaluated with different adaptation schemes and shows that content-specific adaptation can both increase the perceived quality as well as reduce the data traffic. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of this approach by integrating the VAS into Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25781","fieldValue":"DASH"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25781","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25781","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25782","fieldValue":"Shen, Chien-Chung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25782","fieldValue":" In wireless networks such as those based on IEEE 802.11, packet losses due to fading and interference are often misinterpreted as indications of congestion by the congestion control protocol at higher layers, causing an unnecessary decrease in the data sending rate. For delay-constrained applications such as video telephony, packet losses may result in excessive artifacts or freeze in the decoded video. We propose a simple and yet effective mechanism to detect and reduce channel-caused packet losses by adjusting the retry limit parameter of the IEEE 802.11 protocol while taking into account the delay requirement of the traffic. Since the retry limit is left configurable in the IEEE 802.11 standard and does not require cross-layer coordination, our scheme can be easily implemented and incrementally deployed. Experimental results of applying the proposed scheme to a WebRTC-based real-time video communication prototype show significant performance gain compared to the case where the retry limit is configured statically."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25782","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25782","fieldValue":"ACM"}
