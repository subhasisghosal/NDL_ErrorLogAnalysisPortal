The matching of semantic and phonetic information is captured by a unified framework via a bipartite graph model. By considering various technical challenges of the problem, including order insensitivity and partial matching, this approach is less rigid than existing approaches and highly robust. One major component is a phonetic matching model which exploits similarity at the phoneme level. Two learning algorithms for learning the similarity information of basic phonemic matching units based on training examples are investigated. By applying the proposed named entity matching model, a mining system is developed for discovering new named entity translations from daily Web news. The system is able to discover new name translations that cannot be found in the existing bilingual dictionary."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23929","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23929","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23930","fieldValue":" Text queries are natural and intuitive for users to describe their information needs. However, text-based image retrieval faces many challenges. Traditional text retrieval techniques on image descriptions have not been very successful. This is mainly due to the inconsistent textual descriptions and the discrepancies between user queries and terms in the descriptions. To investigate strategies to alleviate this vocabulary problem, this article examines the role of user term feedback in targeted image search that is based on text-based image retrieval. Term feedback refers to the feedback from a user on specific terms regarding their relevance to a target image. Previous studies have indicated the effectiveness of term feedback in interactive text retrieval. However, in our experiments on text-based image retrieval, the term feedback has not been shown to be effective. Our results indicate that, although term feedback has a positive effect by allowing users to identify more relevant terms, it also has a strong negative effect by providing more opportunities for users to specify irrelevant terms. To understand these different effects and their implications, this article further analyzes important factors that contribute to the utility of term feedback and discusses the outlook of term feedback in interactive text-based image retrieval."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3325","fieldValue":" One may wish to use computer graphic images to carry out road visibility studies. Unfortunately, most display devices still have a limited luminance dynamic range, especially in driving simulators. In this paper, we propose a tone-mapping operator (TMO) to compress the luminance dynamic range while preserving the driver's performance for a visual task relevant for a driving situation. We address three display issues of some consequences for road image display: luminance dynamics, image quantization, and high minimum displayable luminance. Our TMO characterizes the effects of local adaptation with a bandpass decomposition of the image using a Laplacian pyramid, and processes the levels separately in order to mimic the human visual system. The contrast perception model uses the visibility level, a usual index in road visibility engineering applications. To assess our algorithm, a psychophysical experiment devoted to a target detection task was designed. Using a Landolt ring, the visual performances of 30 observers were measured: they stared first at a high-dynamic range image and then at the same image processed by a TMO and displayed on a low-dynamic range monitor, for comparison. The evaluation was completed with a visual appearance evaluation. Our operator gives good performances for three typical road situations (one in daylight and two at night), after comparison with four standard TMOs from the literature. The psychovisual assessment of our TMO is limited to these driving situations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3325","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3325","fieldValue":"ACM"}
