Our estimator can operate at a single station and it is able to: 1) classify losses caused by noise, collisions, and hidden nodes; and 2) distinguish between these losses and the unfairness caused by both exposed nodes and channel capture. Our estimator provides quantitative measures of the different causes of lost transmission opportunities, requiring only local measures at the 802.11 transmitter and no modification to the 802.11 protocol or in other stations. Our approach is suited to implementation on commodity hardware, and we demonstrate our prototype implementation via experimental assessments. We finally show how our estimator can help the WLAN station to improve its local performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10075","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10075","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10075","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10076","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present a novel multiperiod spraying algorithm for routing in delay-tolerant networks (DTNs). The goal is to minimize the average copy count used per message until the delivery while maintaining the predefined message delivery rate by the given deadline. In each period, some number of additional copies are sprayed into the network, followed by the wait for message delivery. At any time instance, the total number of message copies distributed to the network depends on the urgency of achieving the delivery rate by the given deadline for that message. Waiting for early delivery in the initial periods with a small number of copies in existence decreases the average number of copies sprayed in the network till delivery. We first discuss two- and three-period variants of our algorithm, and then we also give an idea of how the presented approach can be extended to more periods. We present an in-depth analysis of the algorithm and validate the analytical results with simulations. The results demonstrate that our multiperiod spraying algorithm outperforms the algorithms with a single spraying period."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10076","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10076","fieldValue":"ACM"}
