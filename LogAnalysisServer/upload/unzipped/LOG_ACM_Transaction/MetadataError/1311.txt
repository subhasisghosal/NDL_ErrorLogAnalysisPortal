This is an optimization problem known to be NP-complete in K. However, this paper shows that by ordering the N colors along their principal axis and partitioning the color space with respect to this ordering, the resulting constrained optimization problem can be solved in O(N + KM2) time by dynamic programming (where M is the intensity resolution of the device).Traditional color quantization algorithms recursively bipartition the color space. By using the above dynamic-programming algorithm, we can construct a globally optimal K-partition, K>2, of a color space in the principal direction of the input data. This new partitioning strategy leads to smaller quantization error and hence better image quality. Other algorithmic issues in color quantization such as efficient statistical computations and nearest-neighbor searching are also studied. The interplay between luminance and chromaticity in color quantization with and without color dithering is investigated. Our color quantization method allows the user to choose a balance between the image smoothness and hue accuracy for a given K."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15076","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15076","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15077","fieldValue":" Important standards for device-independent color allow many different color encodings. This freedom obliges users of these standards to choose the color space in which to represent their data. A device-independent interchange color space must exhibit an exact mapping to a colorimetric color representation, ability to encode all visible colors, compact representation for given accuracy, and low computational cost for transforms to and from device-dependent spaces. The performance of CIE 1931 XYZ, CIELUV, CIELAB, YES, CCIR 601-2 YCbCr, and SMPTE-C RGB is measured against these requirements. With extensions, all of these spaces can meet the first two requirements. Quantizing error dominates the representational errors of the tested color spaces. Spaces that offer low quantization error also have low gain for image noise. All linear spaces are less compact than nonlinear alternatives. The choice of nonlinearity is not critical; a wide range of gammas yields acceptable results. The choice of primaries for RGB representations is not critical, except that high-chroma primaries should be avoided. Quantizing the components of the candidate spaces with varying precision yields only small improvements. Compatibility with common image data compression techniques leads to the requirement for low luminance contamination, a property that compromises several otherwise acceptable spaces. The conversion of a device-independent representation to popular device spaces by means of trilinear interpolation requires substantially fewer lookup table entries with CCIR 601-2 YCbCr and CIELAB."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15077","fieldValue":"CIELAB"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15077","fieldValue":"CIELUV"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15077","fieldValue":"SMPTE-C RGB"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15077","fieldValue":"YES"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15077","fieldValue":"ACM"}
