A well-known property of CRNs is the potential heterogeneity in channel availability among secondary users. Therefore, multicast throughput in CRNs may suffer from significant degradation because of this property since a link-level broadcast of a frame may only reach a small subset of destinations that are able to receive on the same channel. This may necessitate multiple sequential transmissions of the same frame by the source on different channels to guarantee delivery to all receivers in the destination set. In case of high data generation rate, delivery delay will be high due to the repeated transmissions by the source. In this paper, we propose an assistance strategy to reduce the effect of the channel heterogeneity property on the multicast throughput in cognitive radio wireless mesh networks (CR-WMNs). This assistance strategy is composed of two main activities: first, allowing multicast receivers to assist the source in delivering the data, and second, allowing the transmission of coded packets so that multicast receivers belonging to different multicast groups can decode and extract their data concurrently. Results show that the proposed assistance paradigm reduces multicast time and increases throughput significantly."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10606","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10606","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10606","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10607","fieldValue":" A method for obtaining topology-preserving maps (TPMs) from virtual coordinates (VCs) of wireless sensor networks is presented. In a virtual coordinate system (VCS), a node is identified by a vector containing its distances, in hops, to a small subset of nodes called anchors. Layout information such as physical voids, shape, and even relative physical positions of sensor nodes with respect to x-y directions are absent in a VCS description. The proposed technique uses Singular Value Decomposition to isolate dominant radial information and to extract topological information from the VCS for networks deployed on 2-D\/3-D surfaces and in 3-D volumes. The transformation required for TPM extraction can be generated using the coordinates of a subset of nodes, resulting in sensor-network-friendly implementation alternatives. TPMs of networks representing a variety of topologies are extracted. Topology preservation error (ETP), a metric that accounts for both the number and degree of node flips, is defined and used to evaluate 2-D TPMs. The techniques extract TPMs with (ETP less than 2%. Topology coordinates provide an economical alternative to physical coordinates for many sensor networking algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10607","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10607","fieldValue":"Topology preserving maps: extracting layout maps of wireless sensor networks from virtual coordinates"}
