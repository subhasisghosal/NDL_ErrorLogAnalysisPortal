Virtual goods share similar economic properties (such as substantial production cost and negligible marginal cost) with other types of digital goods. However, one aspect that distinguishes a virtual good is that consumers in a virtual world may want to use multiple copies of the identical good at the same time, and such simultaneous use of multiple copies of the identical good increases a consumer's utility. In this research, we focus on the COPY permission of virtual goods. We develop an economic model to examine under what conditions the COPY permission setting leads to the highest profit for the creator of a virtual good, and what the pricing strategies are in a dynamic setting when such permission choices are present. Theoretical and practical implications of the research are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8133","fieldValue":"Abdel-Hamid, Tarek"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8133","fieldValue":" Changes in the business environment such as turbulent market forces, rapidly evolving system requirements, and advances in technology demand agility in the development of software systems. Though agile approaches have received wide attention, empirical research that evaluates their effectiveness and appropriateness is scarce. Further, research to-date has investigated individual practices in isolation rather than as an integrated system. Addressing these concerns, we develop a system dynamics simulation model that considers the complex interdependencies among the variety of practices used in agile development. The model is developed on the basis of an extensive review of the literature as well as quantitative and qualitative data collected from real projects in nine organizations. We present the structure of the model focusing on essential agile practices. The validity of the model is established based on extensive structural and behavioral validation tests. Insights gained from experimentation with the model answer important questions faced by development teams in implementing two unique practices used in agile development. The results suggest that due to refactoring, the cost of implementing changes to a system varies cyclically and increases during later phases of development. Delays in refactoring also increase costs and decrease development productivity. Also, the simulation shows that pair programming helps complete more tasks and at a lower cost. The systems dynamics model developed in this research can be used as a tool by IS organizations to understand and analyze the impacts of various agile development practices and project management strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8133","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8133","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8134","fieldValue":" While existing theoretical frameworks describe collective technology adoption patterns, they provide little insight regarding the expected patterns of wiki activity within projects. Another impediment to the study of wiki sustainability is the absence of time-series analysis methods that are suitable for the unique patterns of wiki activity logs. The primary goals of this study are to: (i) develop a novel method for analyzing wiki edit activity logs, (ii) reveal the temporal patterns of corporate wiki edit activity, and (iii) study the factors impacting wikis' sustainability. A validation of our proposed method demonstrates that it is superior to the baseline algorithm in the face of noisy data. Our empirical study combines wiki system edit activity logs with a survey of users' perceptions, and explores 33277 distinct wiki applications within one global organization over the first 5 years of wiki operation. Our results reveal six different prototypical wiki activity patterns, and show that most corporate wikis become inactive after a relatively short period. Findings from the user survey show that users of sustainable wikis are more satisfied with the wiki system and its contents, and feel that the wiki provides them with a sense of community and productivity enhancements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8134","fieldValue":"ACM"}
