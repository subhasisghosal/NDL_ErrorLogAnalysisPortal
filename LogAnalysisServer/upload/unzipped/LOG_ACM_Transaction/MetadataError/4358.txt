Most previous machine-learning-based NER systems are domain-specific, which implies that they may only perform well on some specific domains (e.g., Newswire) but tend to adapt poorly to other related but different domains (e.g., Weblog). Recently, transfer learning techniques have been proposed to NER. However, most transfer learning approaches to NER are developed for binary classification, while NER is a multiclass classification problem in nature. Therefore, one has to first reduce the NER task to multiple binary classification tasks and solve them independently. In this article, we propose a new transfer learning method, named Transfer Joint Embedding (TJE), for cross-domain multiclass classification, which can fully exploit the relationships between classes (labels), and reduce domain difference in data distributions for transfer learning. More specifically, we aim to embed both labels (outputs) and high-dimensional features (inputs) from different domains (e.g., a source domain and a target domain) into a unified low-dimensional latent space, where 1) each label is represented by a prototype and the intrinsic relationships between labels can be measured by Euclidean distance; 2) the distance in data distributions between the source and target domains can be reduced; 3) the source domain labeled data are closer to their corresponding label-prototypes than others. After the latent space is learned, classification on the target domain data can be done with the simple nearest neighbor rule in the latent space. Furthermore, in order to scale up TJE, we propose an efficient algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Finally, we apply the proposed TJE method for NER across different domains on the ACE 2005 dataset, which is a benchmark in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TJE and show that TJE can outperform state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches to NER."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/24075","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2457465.2457467\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24075","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24075","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3339","fieldValue":"OMalley, Marcia K."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3339","fieldValue":" Virtual reality with haptic feedback provides a safe and versatile practice medium for many manual control tasks. Haptic guidance has been shown to improve performance of manual control tasks in virtual environments; however, the efficacy of haptic guidance for training in virtual environments has not been studied conclusively. This article presents experimental results that show negative efficacy of haptic guidance during training in virtual environments. The haptic guidance in this study is a fixed-gain error-reducing shared controller, with the control effort overlaid on the dynamics of the manual control task during training. Performance of the target-hitting manual control task in the absence of guidance is compared for three training protocols. One protocol contained no haptic guidance and represented virtual practice. Two protocols utilized haptic guidance, varying the duration of exposure to guidance during the training sessions. Exposure to the fixed-gain error-reducing shared controller had a detrimental effect on performance of the target-hitting task at the conclusion of a month-long training protocol, regardless of duration of exposure. While the shared controller was designed with knowledge of the task and an intuitive sense of the motions required to achieve good performance, the results indicate that the acquisition of motor skill is a complex phenomenon that is not aided with haptic guidance during training as implemented in this experiment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3339","fieldValue":"ACM"}
