We study mid-air pointing techniques that can be combined with other, domain-specific interactions. We first explore the limits of existing single-mode remote pointing techniques and demonstrate theoretically that they do not support high-precision pointing on ultra-walls. We then explore solutions to improve mid-air pointing efficiency: a tunable acceleration function and a framework for dual-precision (DP) techniques, both with precise tuning guidelines. We designed novel pointing techniques following these guidelines, several of which outperform existing techniques in controlled experiments that involve pointing difficulties never tested prior to this work. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our techniques to help interaction designers choose the best technique according to the task and equipment at hand. Finally, we discuss the cognitive mechanisms that affect pointing performance with these techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5905","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5905","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5906","fieldValue":" This study investigated differences and similarities between finger and pen gestures on stationary devices (sitting posture) and mobile devices (sitting and walking postures). The recorded gestures were analyzed according to multiple gesture features. We found (1) pen and index finger gestures were different in features like size ratio but similar in features like angle difference; (2) implement (pen vs. index finger vs. thumb) interacted with gesture complexity and size in features like articulation time; (3) features like time and shape distance, were different between the pen and index finger on mobile devices (walking) but similar on stationary devices; (4) one-handed thumb gestures had worse performances than index finger gestures by time and accuracy in sitting but similar performances in walking; and (5) for the three implements, gesture drawing time and accuracy on mobile devices reduced from sitting to walking condition. We discuss these findings with implications for future gesture design and research."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5906","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5906","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1048","fieldValue":" Constant propagation is an optimization that substitutes values for names. Interprocedural constant propagation performs this substitution throughout an entire program, propagating constant values across procedure boundaries. CONVEX Computer Corporation has developed an interprocedural optimizer for imperative languages, which is available to users of its C-series supercomputers. An aggressive interprocedural constant propagation algorithm, such as the one implemented in this optimizer, can find many constants to propagate into procedures in scientific FORTRAN applications. Detailed statistics derived from compiling a large set of real scientific applications characterize both the opportunities for interprocedural constant propagation in these codes and the effectivenss of algorithm described. These statistics include the frequency of interprocedural constant propagation, the different types of interprocedural constant propagation, which constants are most frequently propagated, and the relationship between interprocedural constant propagation and other interprocedural optimizations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1048","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1048","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1497","fieldValue":" In recent years, some works have discussed the conception of location-aware Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems with very positive feedback from participants. However, in most cases, complementary quantitative evaluations have not been carried out to confirm those results. To contribute to clarifying the validity of these approaches, our study quantitatively evaluated the effect of using language models with location knowledge on the efficiency of a word and sentence prediction system. Using corpora collected for three different locations (classroom, school cafeteria, home), location-specific language models were trained with sentences from each location and compared with a traditional all-purpose language model, trained on all corpora. User tests showed a modest mean improvement of 2.4&percnt; and 1.3&percnt; for Words Per Minute (WPM) and Keystroke Saving Rate (KSR), respectively, but the differences were not statistically significant. Since our text prediction system relies on the concept of sentence reuse, we ran a set of simulations with language models having different sentence knowledge levels (0&percnt;, 25&percnt;, 50&percnt;, 75&percnt;, 100&percnt;). We also introduced in the comparison a second location-aware strategy that combines the location-specific approach with the all-purpose approach (mixed approach). The mixed language models performed better under low sentence-reuse conditions (0&percnt;, 25&percnt;, 50&percnt;) with 1.0&percnt;, 1.3&percnt;, and 1.2&percnt; KSR improvements, respectively. The location-specific language models performed better under high sentence-reuse conditions (75&percnt;, 100&percnt;) with 1.7&percnt; and 1.5&percnt; KSR improvements, respectively."}
