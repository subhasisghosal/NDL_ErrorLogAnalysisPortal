Given a corpus of motion capture data, we automatically construct a directed graph called a motion graph that encapsulates connections among the database. The motion graph consists both of pieces of original motion and automatically generated transitions. Motion can be generated simply by building walks on the graph. We present a general framework for extracting particular graph walks that meet a user's specifications. We then show how this framework can be applied to the specific problem of generating different styles of locomotion along arbitrary paths."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15242","fieldValue":" There are many applications that demand large quantities of natural looking motion. It is difficult to synthesize motion that looks natural, particularly when it is people who must move. In this paper, we present a framework that generates human motions by cutting and pasting motion capture data. Selecting a collection of clips that yields an acceptable motion is a combinatorial problem that we manage as a randomized search of a hierarchy of graphs. This approach can generate motion sequences that satisfy a variety of constraints automatically. The motions are smooth and human-looking. They are generated in real time so that we can author complex motions interactively. The algorithm generates multiple motions that satisfy a given set of constraints, allowing a variety of choices for the animator. It can easily synthesize multiple motions that interact with each other using constraints. This framework allows the extensive re-use of motion capture data for new purposes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2444","fieldValue":" Quickselect with median-of-3 is largely used in practice and its behavior is fairly well understood. However, the following natural adaptive variant, which we call proportion-from-3, had not been previously analyzed: â\u20ACœchoose as pivot the smallest of the sample if the relative rank of the sought element is below 1\/3, the largest if the relative rank is above 2\/3, and the median if the relative rank is between 1\/3 and 2\/3.â\u20AC? We first analyze the average number of comparisons made when using proportion-from-2 and then for proportion-from-3. We also analyze Î½-find, a generalization of proportion-from-3 with interval breakpoints at Î½ and 1-Î½. We show that there exists an optimal value of Î½ and we also provide the range of values of Î½ where Î½-find outperforms median-of-3. Then, we consider the average total cost of these strategies, which takes into account the cost of both comparisons and exchanges. Our results strongly suggest that a suitable implementation of Î½-find could be the method of choice in a practical setting. We also study the behavior of proportion-from-s with s>3 and in particular we show that proportion-from-s-like strategies are optimal when sâ\u2020\u2019âˆž."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2444","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2444","fieldValue":"ACM"}
