This article proposes an alternative approach to statistical modeling that is based on an old but mostly forgotten idea, namely Thurstone modeling. Traditional statistical methods assume that either the measured data, in the case of parametric statistics, or the rank-order transformed data, in the case of nonparametric statistics, are samples from a specific (usually Gaussian) distribution with unknown parameters. Consequently, such methods should not be applied when this assumption is not valid. Thurstone modeling similarly assumes the existence of an underlying process that obeys an a priori assumed distribution with unknown parameters, but combines this underlying process with a flexible response mechanism that can be either continuous or discrete and either linear or nonlinear. One important advantage of Thurstone modeling is that traditional statistical methods can still be applied on the underlying process, irrespective of the nature of the measured data itself. Another advantage is that Thurstone models can be graphically represented, which helps to communicate them to a broad audience. A new interactive statistical package, Interactive Log Likelihood MOdeling (Illmo), was specifically designed for estimating and rendering Thurstone models and is intended to bring Thurstone modeling within the reach of persons who are not experts in statistics. Illmo is unique in the sense that it provides not only extensive graphical renderings of the data analysis results but also an interface for navigating between different model options. In this way, users can interactively explore different models and decide on an adequate balance between model complexity and agreement with the experimental data. Hypothesis testing on model parameters is also made intuitive and is supported by both textual and graphical feedback. The flexibility and ease of use of Illmo means that it is also potentially useful as a didactic tool for teaching statistics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7186","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7186","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7187","fieldValue":" Monitoring dynamic objects in surveillance applications is normally a demanding activity for operators, not only because of the complexity and high dimensionality of the data but also because of other factors like time constraints and uncertainty. Timely detection of anomalous objects or situations that need further investigation may reduce operatorsâ\u20AC™ cognitive load. Surveillance applications may include anomaly detection capabilities, but their use is not widespread, as they usually generate a high number of false alarms, they do not provide appropriate cognitive support for operators, and their outcomes can be difficult to comprehend and trust. Visual analytics can bridge the gap between computational and human approaches to detecting anomalous behavior in traffic data, making this process more transparent. As a step toward this goal of transparency, this article presents an evaluation that assesses whether visualizations of normal behavioral models of vessel traffic support two of the main analytical tasks specified during our field work in maritime control centers. The evaluation combines quantitative and qualitative usability assessments. The quantitative evaluation, which was carried out with a proof-of-concept prototype, reveals that participants who used the visualization of normal behavioral models outperformed the group that did not do so. The qualitative assessment shows that domain experts have a positive attitude toward the provision of automatic support and the visualization of normal behavioral models, as these aids may reduce reaction time and increase trust in and comprehensibility of the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7188","fieldValue":"Shaw, Chris D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7188","fieldValue":" We introduce a propagation-based parametric symbolic model approach to supporting analytic provenance. This approach combines a script language to capture and encode the analytic process and a parametrically controlled symbolic model to represent and reuse the logic of the analysis process. Our approach first appeared in a visual analytics system called CZSaw. Using a script to capture the analystâ\u20AC™s interactions at a meaningful system action level allows the creation of a parametrically controlled symbolic model in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Using the DAG allows propagating changes. Graph nodes correspond to variables in CZSaw scripts, which are results (data and data visualizations) generated from user interactions. The user interacts with variables representing entities or relations to create the next stepâ\u20AC™s results. Graph edges represent dependency relationships among nodes. Any change to a variable triggers the propagation mechanism to update downstream dependent variables and in turn updates data views to reflect the change. The analyst can reuse parts of the analysis process by assigning new values to a node in the graph. We evaluated this symbolic model approach by solving three IEEE VAST Challenge contest problems (from IEEE VAST 2008, 2009, and 2010). In each of these challenges, the analyst first created a symbolic model to explore, understand, analyze, and solve a particular subproblem and then reused the model via its dependency graph propagation mechanism to solve similar subproblems. With the script and model, CZSaw supports the analytic provenance by capturing, encoding, and reusing the analysis process. The analyst can recall the chronological states of the analysis process with the CZSaw script and may interpret the underlying rationale of the analysis with the symbolic model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7188","fieldValue":"ACM"}
