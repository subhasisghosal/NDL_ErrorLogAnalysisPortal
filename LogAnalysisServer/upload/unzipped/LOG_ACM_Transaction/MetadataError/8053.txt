But reporting real-time usage information for individual households raises privacy concerns. Existing techniques to guarantee differential privacy (DP) of smart meter users either are not fault tolerant or achieve (possibly partial) fault tolerance at high communication overheads. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant protocol for smart metering that can handle general communication failures while ensuring DP with significantly improved efficiency and lower errors compared with the state of the art. Our protocol handles fail-stop faults proactively by using a novel design of future ciphertexts, and distributes trust among the smart meters by sharing secret keys among them. We prove the DP properties of our protocol and analyze its advantages in fault tolerance, accuracy, and communication efficiency relative to competing techniques. We illustrate our analysis by simulations driven by real-world traces of electricity consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10920","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10920","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10920","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10920","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1998","fieldValue":"Gupta, Rajesh K"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1998","fieldValue":" General-purpose graphic processing units (GP-GPUs) offer high computational throughput using thousands of integrated processing elements (PEs). These PEs are stressed during workload execution, and negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) adversely affects their reliability by introducing new delay-induced faults. However, the effect of these delay variations is not uniformly spread across the PEs: some are affected moreâ\u20AC\u201Dhence less reliableâ\u20AC\u201Dthan others. This variation causes significant reduction in the lifetime of GP-GPU parts. In this article, we address the problem of â\u20ACœwear levelingâ\u20AC? across processing units to mitigate lifetime uncertainty in GP-GPUs. We propose innovations in the static compiled code that can improve healing in PEs and stream cores (SCs) based on their degradation status. PE healing is a fine-grained very long instruction word (VLIW) slot assignment scheme that balances the stress of instructions across the PEs within an SC. SC healing is a coarse-grained workload allocation scheme that distributes workload across SCs in GP-GPUs. Both schemes share a common property: they adaptively shift workload from less reliable units to more reliable units, either spatially or temporally. These software schemes are based on online calibration with NBTI monitoring that equalizes the expected lifetime of PEs and SCs by regenerating adaptive compiled codes to respond to the specific health state of the GP-GPUs. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes for various OpenCL kernels from the AMD APP SDK on Evergreen and Southern Island GPU architectures. The aging-aware healthy kernels generated by the PE (or SC) healing scheme reduce NBTI-induced voltage threshold shift by 30&percnt; (77&percnt; in the case of SCs), with no (moderate) performance penalty compared to the naive kernels."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1998","fieldValue":"NBTI"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1998","fieldValue":"VLIW"}
