Using the most current Internet topology is not practical since its size is prohibitive for detailed, packet-level interdomain simulations. Besides being of moderate size, the topology should be policy-aware, that is, it needs to represent business relationships between adjacent nodes (that represent autonomous systems). In this paper, we address this issue by providing a framework to generate small, realistic, and policy-aware topologies. We propose HBR, a novel sampling method, which exploits the inherent hierarchy of the policy-aware Internet topology. We formally prove that our approach generates connected and legitimate topologies, which are compatible with the policy-based routing conventions and rules. Using simulations, we show that HBR generates topologies that: 1) maintain the graph properties of the real topology; 2) provide reasonably realistic interdomain simulation results while reducing the computational complexity by several orders of magnitude as compared to the initial topology. Our approach provides a permanent solution to the problem of interdomain routing evaluations: Given a more accurate and complete topology, HBR can generate better small topologies in the future."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10274","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10275","fieldValue":" We study network optimization that considers power minimization as an objective. Studies have shown that mechanisms such as speed scaling can significantly reduce the power consumption of telecommunication networks by matching the consumption of each network element to the amount of processing required for its carried traffic. Most existing research on speed scaling focuses on a single network element in isolation. We aim for a network-wide optimization. Specifically, we study a routing problem with the objective of provisioning guaranteed speed\/bandwidth for a given demand matrix while minimizing power consumption. Optimizing the routes critically relies on the characteristic of the speed-power curve f(s), which is how power is consumed as a function of the processing speed s. If f is superadditive, we show that there is no bounded approximation in general for integral routing, i.e., each traffic demand follows a single path. This contrasts with the well-known logarithmic approximation for së«?itive functions. However, for common speed-power curves such as polynomials f(s) = $Âµs^Î±, we are able to show a constant approximation via a simple scheme of randomized rounding. We also generalize this rounding approach to handle the case in which a nonzero startup cost Ïƒ appears in the speed-power curve, i.e., f(s) = {0, if s = 0 Ïƒ + ÂµsÎ±, if s > 0. We present an O((Ïƒ\/Âµ)1\/Î±$)-approximation, and we discuss why coming up with an approximation ratio independent of the startup cost may be hard. Finally, we provide simulation results to validate our algorithmic approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10275","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10275","fieldValue":"ACM"}
