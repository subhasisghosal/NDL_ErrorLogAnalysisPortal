The algorithms require only static inputs that can be easily obtained from the routers: the BGP routes learned from neighboring domains, the import policies configured on the BGP sessions, and the internal topology. Solving the problem would be easy if the route-selection process were deterministic and every router received all candidate BGP routes. However, two important features of BGP--the Multiple Exit Discriminator (MED) attribute and route reflectors--violate these properties. After presenting a simple route-prediction algorithm for networks that do not use these features, we present algorithms that capture the effects of the MED attribute and route reflectors in isolation. Then, we explain why the interaction between these two features precludes efficient route prediction. These two features also create difficulties for the operation of BGP itself, leading us to suggest improvements to BGP that achieve the same goals as MED and route reflection without introducing the negative side effects."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9591","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9591","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9591","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9592","fieldValue":"Di Battista, Giuseppe"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9592","fieldValue":" We investigate the problem of computing the types of the relationships between Internet Autonomous Systems. We refer to the model introduced by Gao [IEEE\/ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING, 9(6):733-645, 2001] and Subramanian et al. (IEEE Infocom, 2002) that bases the discovery of such relationships on the analysis of the AS paths extracted from the BGP routing tables. We characterize the time complexity of the above problem, showing both NP-completeness results and efficient algorithms for solving specific cases. Motivated by the hardness of the general problem, we propose approximation algorithms and heuristics based on a novel paradigm and show their effectiveness against publicly available data sets. The experiments provide evidence that our algorithms perform significantly better than state-of-the-art heuristics."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9592","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9592","fieldValue":"ACM"}
