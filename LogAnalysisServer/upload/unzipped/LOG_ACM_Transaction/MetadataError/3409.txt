The problem is set up to find a set of sensor positions such that given distance constraints are satisfied. The nonconvex constraints in the formulation are then relaxed in order to yield a semidefinite program that can be solved efficiently.The basic model is extended in order to account for noisy distance information. In particular, a maximum likelihood based formulation and an interval based formulation are discussed. The SDP solution can then also be used as a starting point for steepest descent based local optimization techniques that can further refine the SDP solution.We also describe the extension of the basic method to develop an iterative distributed SDP method for solving very large scale semidefinite programs that arise out of localization problems for large dense networks and are intractable using centralized methods.The performance evaluation of the technique with regard to estimation accuracy and computation time is also presented by the means of extensive simulations.Our SDP scheme also seems to be applicable to solving other Euclidean geometry problems where points are locally connected."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21190","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21190","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21191","fieldValue":" In this article, we investigate the impact of radio irregularity on wireless sensor networks. Radio irregularity is a common phenomenon that arises from multiple factors, such as variance in RF sending power and different path losses, depending on the direction of propagation. From our experiments, we discover that the variance in received signal strength is largely random; however, it exhibits a continuous change with incremental changes in direction. With empirical data obtained from the MICA2 and MICAZ platforms, we establish a radio model for simulation, called the Radio Irregularity Model (RIM). This model is the first to bridge the discrepancy between the spherical radio models used by simulators and the physical reality of radio signals. With this model, we investigate the impact of radio irregularity on several upper layer protocols, including MAC, routing, localization and topology control. Our results show that radio irregularity has a relatively larger impact on the routing layer than the MAC layer. It also shows that radio irregularity leads to larger localization errors and makes it harder to maintain communication connectivity in topology control. To deal with these issues, we present eight solutions to deal with radio irregularity. We evaluate three of them in detail. The results obtained from both the simulations and a running testbed demonstrate that our solutions greatly improve system performance in the presence of radio irregularity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21191","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21191","fieldValue":"ACM"}
