Resource management is an important and challenging task, especially for multitier applications with unpredictable time-varying workloads. Work in resource management using control theory has shown clear benefits of dynamically adjusting resource allocations to match fluctuating workloads. However, little work has been done toward adaptive controllers for unknown workload types. This work presents a new resource management scheme that incorporates the Kalman filter into feedback controllers to dynamically allocate CPU resources to virtual machines hosting server applications. We present a set of controllers that continuously detect and self-adapt to unforeseen workload changes. Furthermore, our most advanced controller also self-configures itself without any a priori information and with a small 4.8&percnt; performance penalty in the case of high-intensity workload changes. In addition, our controllers are enhanced to deal with multitier server applications: by using the pair-wise resource coupling between tiers, they improve server response to large workload increases as compared to controllers with no such resource-coupling mechanism. Our approaches are evaluated and their performance is illustrated on a 3-tier Rubis benchmark website deployed on a prototype Xen-virtualized cluster."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1293","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1293","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3845","fieldValue":"Gan, Woon-Seng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3845","fieldValue":"Tan, Ee-Leng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3845","fieldValue":" The diversity of today's playback systems requires a flexible, efficient, and immersive reproduction of sound scenes in digital media. Spatial audio reproduction based on primary-ambient extraction (PAE) fulfills this objective, where accurate extraction of primary and ambient components from sound mixtures in channel-based audio is crucial. Severe extraction error was found in existing PAE approaches when dealing with sound mixtures that contain a relatively strong ambient component, a commonly encountered case in the sound scenes of digital media. In this paper, we propose a novel ambient spectrum estimation (ASE) framework to improve the performance of PAE. The ASE framework exploits the equal magnitude of the uncorrelated ambient components in two channels of a stereo signal, and reformulates the PAE problem into the problem of estimating either ambient phase or magnitude. In particular, we take advantage of the sparse characteristic of the primary components to derive sparse solutions for ASE based PAE, together with an approximate solution that can significantly reduce the computational cost. Our objective and subjective experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASE approaches significantly outperform existing approaches, especially when the ambient component is relatively strong."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3845","fieldValue":"Primary-ambient extraction using ambient spectrum estimation for immersive spatial audio reproduction"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3845","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3845","fieldValue":"ACM"}
