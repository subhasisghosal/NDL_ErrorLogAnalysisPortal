The focus is on developing decentralized control laws at end-systems and routers at the level of fluid-flow models, that can provably satisfy such properties in arbitrary networks, and subsequently approximate these features through practical packet-level implementations.Two families of control laws are developed. The first \"dual\" control law is able to achieve the first three objectives for arbitrary networks and delays, but is forced to constrain the resource allocation policy. We subsequently develop a \"primal-dual\" law that overcomes this limitation and allows sources to match their steady-state preferences at a slower time-scale, provided a bound on round-trip-times is known.We develop two packet-level implementations of this protocol, using 1) ECN marking, and 2) queueing delay, as means of communicating the congestion measure from links to sources. We demonstrate using ns-2 simulations the stability of the protocol and its equilibrium features in terms of utilization, queueing and fairness, under a variety of scaling parameters."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9312","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9312","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9312","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9312","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9313","fieldValue":" In this paper, we consider a network with both controllable and uncontrollable flows. Uncontrollable flows are typically generated from applications with stringent QoS requirements and are given high priority. On the other hand, controllable flows are typically generated by elastic applications and can adapt to the available link capacities in the network. We provide a general model of such a system and analyze its queueing behavior. Specially, we obtain a lower bound and an asymptotic upper bound for the tail of the workload distribution at each link in the network. These queueing results provide us with guidelines on how to design a feedback flow control system. Simulation results show that the lower bound and asymptotic upper bound are quite accurate and that our feedback control method can effectively control the queue length in the presence of both controllable and uncontrollable traffic. Finally, we describe a distributed strategy that uses the notion of Active Queue Management (AQM) for implementing our flow control solution."}
