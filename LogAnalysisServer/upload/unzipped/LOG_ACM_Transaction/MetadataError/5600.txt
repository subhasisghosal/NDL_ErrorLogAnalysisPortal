Despite the large amount of raw information available on the web, a tool able to extract a measure of the correlation between a list of genes and biological processes is not yet available. In this paper, we present Gelsius, a workflow that incorporates biomedical literature to quantify the correlation between genes and terms describing biological processes. To achieve this target, we build different modules focusing on query expansion and document cononicalization. In this way, we reached to improve the measurement of correlation, performed using a latent semantic analysis approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete tool able to extract a measure of genes-biological processes correlation from literature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on six biological processes and a set of genes, by showing that correlation results for known relationships are in accordance with definitions of gene functions provided by NCI Thesaurus. On the other side, the tool is able to propose new candidate relationships for later experimental validation.

This technique holds promise for many biological domains in which classified examples are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Most traditional active learning methods ask very specific queries to the Oracle (e.g., a human expert) to label an unlabeled example. The example may consist of numerous features, many of which are irrelevant. Removing such features will create a shorter query with only relevant features, and it will be easier for the Oracle to answer. We propose a generalized query-based active learning (GQAL) approach that constructs generalized queries based on multiple instances. By constructing appropriately generalized queries, we can achieve higher accuracy compared to traditional active learning methods. We apply our active learning method to find differentially DNA methylated regions (DMRs). DMRs are DNA locations in the genome that are known to be involved in tissue differentiation, epigenetic regulation, and disease. We also apply our method on 13 other data sets and show that our method is better than another popular active learning technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4931","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4931","fieldValue":"ACM"}
