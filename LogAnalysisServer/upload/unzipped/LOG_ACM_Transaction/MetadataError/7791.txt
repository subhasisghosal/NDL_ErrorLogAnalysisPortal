A recent work proposes to partition all single-lobe beams into groups and to form composite multilobe beam patterns to transmit multicast traffic. Depending on how the power is split among the individual beams constituting a composite beam pattern, two power models are considered: 1) equal power split (EQP), and 2) asymmetric power split (ASP). This paper revisits the key challenge--beam partitioning in the beamforming-multicast problem--and makes significant progress in both algorithmic and analytic aspects of the problem. Under EQP, we propose a low-complexity optimal algorithm based on dynamic programming. Under ASP, we prove that it is NP-hard to have (3\/2 -- Îµ) - approximation algorithm for any Îµ > 0. For discrete rate functions under ASP, we develop an Asymptotic Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (APTAS), an asymptotic (3\/2+ Î²)-approximation solution (where Î² â\u2030¥ 0 depends on the wireless technology), and an asymptotic 2-approximation solution to the problem by relating the problem to a generalized version of the bin-packing problem. In retrospect, we also obtain an asymptotic 2-approximation solution for the generalized bin-packing problem, which is of independent interest. For continuous rate functions under ASP, we develop sufficient conditions under which the optimal number of composite beams is 1, K, and arbitrary, respectively, where K is the total number of single-lobe beams. Both experimental results and simulations based on real-world channel measurements corroborate our analytical results by showing significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10397","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10398","fieldValue":" This paper considers the problem of designing scheduling algorithms for multichannel (e.g., OFDM-based) wireless downlink networks, with a large number of users and proportionally large bandwidth. For this system, while the classical MaxWeight algorithm is known to be throughput-optimal, its buffer-overflow performance is very poor (formally, it is shown that it has zero rate function in our setting). To address this, a class of algorithms called iterated Heaviest matching with Longest Queues First (iHLQF) is proposed. The algorithms in this class are shown to be throughput-optimal for a general class of arrival\/channel processes, and also rate-function-optimal (i.e., exponentially small buffer overflow probability) for certain arrival\/ channel processes. iHLQF, however, has higher complexity than MaxWeight $(n^4 versus n2, respectively). To overcome this issue, a new algorithm called Server-Side Greedy (SSG) is proposed. It is shown that SSG is throughput-optimal, results in a much better per-user buffer overflow performance than the MaxWeight algorithm (positive rate function for certain arrival\/ channel processes), and has a computational complexity (n2$) that is comparable to the MaxWeight algorithm. Thus, it provides a nice tradeoff between buffer-overflow performance and computational complexity. These results are validated by both analysis and simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10398","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10398","fieldValue":"ACM"}
