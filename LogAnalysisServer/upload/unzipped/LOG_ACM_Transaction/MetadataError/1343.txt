In the presented method the interpolation of the distance field is guided by a warp function controlled by a set of corresponding anchor points. Some rules for defining a smooth least-distorting warp function are given. To reduce the distortion of the intermediate shapes, the warp function is decomposed into a rigid rotational part and an elastic part. The distance field interpolation method is modified so that the interpolation is done in correlation with the warp function. The method provides the animator with a technique that can be used to create a set of models forming a smooth transition between pairs of a given sequence of keyframe models. The advantage of the new approach is that it is capable of morphing between objects having a different topological genus where no correspondence between the geometric primitives of the models needs to be established. The desired correspondence is defined by an animator in terms of a relatively small number of anchor points"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15160","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15160","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15161","fieldValue":"Gonzalez-Ochoa, Carlos"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15161","fieldValue":"McCammon, Scott"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15161","fieldValue":" Combining a polynomial free-form surface representation with Gauss' divergence theorem allows efficient and exact calculation of the moments of the enclosed objects. For example, for an cubic representation, volume, center of mass, and the inertia tensor can be computed in seconds even for complex objects with serval thousand patches while change due to local modification of the surface geometry can be computed in real-time as feedback for animation or design. Speed and simplicity of the approach allow solving the inverse problem of modeling to match prescribed moments."}
