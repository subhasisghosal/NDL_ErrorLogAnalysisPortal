This is a generalization of the univariate weighted spline, developed by Salkauskas, in that a weighted minimization problem is solved. The minimization problem solved is a weighted version of the problem that the natural bicubic spline and Gordon's spline-blended interpolants minimize. The surface is represented as a piecewise bicubic Hermite interpolant whose derivatives are the solution of a linear system of equations. For computer-aided-design applications, the shape of the surface is controlled by weighting the variation over the individual patches, whereas many other shape-control methods weight the discrete data points. A method for selecting the weights is presented so that the weighted bicubic spline effectively solves the important and often difficult problem of interpolating rapidly varying data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14976","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14976","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14977","fieldValue":"McKenna, Michael"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14977","fieldValue":" An O(n2) hidden-surface removal algorithm is shown. This is an improvement over the previous best worst-case performance of O(n2 log n). It has been established that the hidden-line and hidden-surface problems have an &OHgr;(n2) worst-case lower bound, so the algorithm is optimal. However, the algorithm is not output-size sensitive. Two corollaries to the result are (1) hidden-lines can be removed in optimal O(n2) time, and (2) the portion of a 3-D polyhedron visible from a given interior point is constructible in optimal O(n2) time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14978","fieldValue":" One of the central issues in computer-aided geometric design is the representation of free-form surfaces which are needed for many purposes in engineering and science. Several limitations are imposed on most available surface systems: the rectangularity of the network describing a surface and the manipulation of surfaces without regard to the volume enclosed are examples. Polyhedral subdivision methods suggest themselves as a solution to these problems. Their use, however, is not widespread for several reasons such as the lack of boundary control, and interpolation and interrogation capabilities.In this paper the original work on subdivision methods is extended to overcome these problems. Two methods are described, one for controlling the boundary curves of such surfaces, and another for interpolating points on irregular networks. A general surface\/surface intersection algorithm is also provided: seven decisions need to be made in order to specify a particular implementation. The algorithm is also suitable for intersecting other classes of surfaces amongst which are the popular BÃ©zier and B-spline surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14978","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14978","fieldValue":"ACM"}
