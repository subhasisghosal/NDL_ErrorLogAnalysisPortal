Regarding traffic safety applications for VANETs, warning messages have to be quickly and smartly disseminated in order to reduce the required dissemination time and to increase the number of vehicles receiving the traffic warning information. In the past, several approaches have been proposed to improve the alert dissemination process in multihop wireless networks, but none of them were tested in real urban scenarios, adapting its behavior to the propagation features of the scenario. In this paper, we present the Profile-driven Adaptive Warning Dissemination Scheme (PAWDS) designed to improve the warning message dissemination process. With respect to previous proposals, our proposed scheme uses a mapping technique based on adapting the dissemination strategy according to both the characteristics of the street area where the vehicles are moving and the density of vehicles in the target scenario. Our algorithm reported a noticeable improvement in the performance of alert dissemination processes in scenarios based on real city maps."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10467","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1953","fieldValue":" Recent developments in register allocation, mostly linked to static single assignment (SSA) form, have shown the benefits of decoupling the problem in two phases: a first spilling phase places load and store instructions so that the register pressure at all program points is small enough, and a second assignment and coalescing phase maps the variables to physical registers and reduces the number of move instructions among registers. This article focuses on the first phase, for which many open questions remain: in particular, we study the notion of optimal spilling (what can be expressed&quest;) and the impact of SSA form (does it help&quest;). To identify the important features for optimal spilling on load-store architectures, we develop a new integer linear programming formulation, more accurate and expressive than previous approaches. Among other features, we can express SSA Ï\u2020-functions, memory-to-memory copies, and the fact that a value can be stored simultaneously in a register and in memory. Based on this formulation, we present a thorough analysis of the results obtained for the SPECINT 2000 and EEMBC 1.1 benchmarks, from which we draw, among others, the following conclusions: (1) rematerialization is extremely important; (2) SSA complicates the formulation of optimal spilling, especially because of memory coalescing when the code is not in conventional SSA (CSSA); (3) microarchitectural features are significant and thus have to be accounted for; and (4) significant savings can be obtained in terms of static spill costs, cache miss rates, and dynamic instruction counts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1953","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1953","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10468","fieldValue":" The wide channels feature combines two adjacent channels to form a new, wider channel to facilitate high-data-rate transmissions in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-based IEEE 802.11n networks. Using a wider channel can exacerbate interference effects. Furthermore, contrary to what has been reported by prior studies, we find that wide channels do not always provide benefits in isolation (i.e., one link without interference) and can even degrade performance. We conduct an in-depth, experimental study to understand the implications of wide channels on throughput performance. Based on our measurements, we design an auto-configuration framework called ACORN for enterprise 802.11n WLANs. ACORN integrates the functions of user association and channel allocation since our study reveals that they are tightly coupled when wide channels are used. We show that the channel allocation problem with the constraints of wide channels is NP-complete. Thus, ACORN uses an algorithm that provides a worst-case approximation ratio of O(1\/Î\u201D+1), with Î\u201D being the maximum node degree in the network. We implement ACORN on our 802.11n testbed. Our evaluations show that ACORN: 1) outperforms previous approaches that are agnostic to wide channels constraints; it provides per-AP throughput gains ranging from 1.5Ã\u2014 to 6Ã\u2014 and 2) in practice, its channel allocation module achieves an approximation ratio much better than the theoretically predicted O(1\/Î\u201D+1)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10468","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
