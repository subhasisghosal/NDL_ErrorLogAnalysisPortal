The nature of wireless transmissions does not lead to arbitrary undirected graphs but to structured graphs which we characterize by the polynomially bounded growth property. In contrast to many existing graph models for wireless networks, the property of polynomially bounded growth is defined independently of geometric data such as positional information. On such wireless networks, we present an approach that can be used to create polynomial-time approximation schemes for several optimization problems called the local neighborhood-based scheme. We apply this approach to the problems of seeking maximum (weight) independent sets and minimum dominating sets. These are two important problems in the area of wireless communication networks and are also used in many applications ranging from clustering to routing strategies. However, the approach is presented in a general fashion since it can be applied to other problems as well. The approach for the approximation schemes is robust in the sense that it accepts any undirected graph as input and either outputs a solution of desired quality or correctly asserts that the graph presented as input does not satisfy the structural assumption of a wireless network (an NP-hard problem)."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2342","fieldValue":"PTAS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14175","fieldValue":"Hou, Wen-Chi"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14175","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present an algorithm to strictly control the time to process an estimator for an aggregate relational query. The algorithm implemented in a prototype database management system, called CASE-DB, iteratively samples from input relations, and evaluates the associated estimator until the time quota expires.In order to estimate the time cost of a query, CASE-DB uses adaptive time cost formulas. The formulas are adaptive in that the parameters of the formulas can be adjusted at runtime to better fit the characteristics of a query. To control the use of time quota, CASE-DB adopts the one-at-a-time-interval time control strategy to make a tradeoff between the risks of overspending and the overhead, finally, experimental evaluation of the methodology is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14175","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14175","fieldValue":"ACM"}
