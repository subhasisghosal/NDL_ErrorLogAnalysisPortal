{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20962","fieldValue":" Building reliable storage systems becomes increasingly challenging as the complexity of modern storage systems continues to grow. Understanding storage failure characteristics is crucially important for designing and building a reliable storage system. While several recent studies have been conducted on understanding storage failures, almost all of them focus on the failure characteristics of one componentâ\u20AC\u201Ddisksâ\u20AC\u201Dand do not study other storage component failures. This article analyzes the failure characteristics of storage subsystems. More specifically, we analyzed the storage logs collected from about 39,000 storage systems commercially deployed at various customer sites. The dataset covers a period of 44 months and includes about 1,800,000 disks hosted in about 155,000 storage-shelf enclosures. Our study reveals many interesting findings, providing useful guidelines for designing reliable storage systems. Some of our major findings include: (1) In addition to disk failures that contribute to 20--55&percnt; of storage subsystem failures, other components such as physical interconnects and protocol stacks also account for a significant percentage of storage subsystem failures. (2) Each individual storage subsystem failure type, and storage subsystem failure as a whole, exhibits strong self-correlations. In addition, these failures exhibit â\u20ACœburstyâ\u20AC? patterns. (3) Storage subsystems configured with redundant interconnects experience 30--40&percnt; lower failure rates than those with a single interconnect. (4) Spanning disks of a RAID group across multiple shelves provides a more resilient solution for storage subsystems than within a single shelf."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20962","fieldValue":"Are disks the dominant contributor for storage failures?: A comprehensive study of storage subsystem failure characteristics"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20962","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20962","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3002","fieldValue":" Bilingual dictionaries can be automatically extended by new translations using comparable corpora. The general idea is based on the assumption that similar words have similar contexts across languages. However, previous studies have mainly focused on Indo-European languages, or use only a bag-of-words model to describe the context. Furthermore, we argue that it is helpful to extract only the statistically significant context, instead of using all context. The present approach addresses these issues in the following manner. First, based on the context of a word with an unknown translation (query word), we extract salient pivot words. Pivot words are words for which a translation is already available in a bilingual dictionary. For the extraction of salient pivot words, we use a Bayesian estimation of the point-wise mutual information to measure statistical significance. In the second step, we match these pivot words across languages to identify translation candidates for the query word. We therefore calculate a similarity score between the query word and a translation candidate using the probability that the same pivots will be extracted for both the query word and the translation candidate. The proposed method uses several context positions, namely, a bag-of-words of one sentence, and the successors, predecessors, and siblings with respect to the dependency parse tree of the sentence. In order to make these context positions comparable across Japanese and English, which are unrelated languages, we use several heuristics to adjust the dependency trees appropriately. We demonstrate that the proposed method significantly increases the accuracy of word translations, as compared to previous methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20963","fieldValue":"Arpaci-Dusseau, Andrea C."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20963","fieldValue":"Arpaci-Dusseau, Remzi H."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20963","fieldValue":" An important threat to reliable storage of data is silent data corruption. In order to develop suitable protection mechanisms against data corruption, it is essential to understand its characteristics. In this article, we present the first large-scale study of data corruption. We analyze corruption instances recorded in production storage systems containing a total of 1.53 million disk drives, over a period of 41 months. We study three classes of corruption: checksum mismatches, identity discrepancies, and parity inconsistencies. We focus on checksum mismatches since they occur the most. We find more than 400,000 instances of checksum mismatches over the 41-month period. We find many interesting trends among these instances, including: (i) nearline disks (and their adapters) develop checksum mismatches an order of magnitude more often than enterprise-class disk drives, (ii) checksum mismatches within the same disk are not independent events and they show high spatial and temporal locality, and (iii) checksum mismatches across different disks in the same storage system are not independent. We use our observations to derive lessons for corruption-proof system design."}
