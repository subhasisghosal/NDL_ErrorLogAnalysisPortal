However, many existing distributed power control algorithms do not work well without an effective connection admission control (CAC) mechanism, because they could diverge and result in dropping existing calls when an infeasible call is admitted. In this work, based on a system parameter defined as the discriminant, we propose two distributed CAC algorithms for a power-controlled system. Under these CAC schemes, an infeasible call is rejected early, and incurs only a small disturbance to existing calls, while a feasible call is admitted and the system converges to the Pareto optimal power assignment. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of our algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9043","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9044","fieldValue":"Leung, Matthew K H"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9044","fieldValue":"Lui, John C S"}
