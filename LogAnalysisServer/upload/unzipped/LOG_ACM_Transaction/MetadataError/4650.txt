In this article, we address two key issues that impact the performance of a multihop UWB-based WPAN: throughput and transmission range. Arbitrary selection of routes in such a network may result in reserving an unnecessarily long channel time, and hence low network throughput and high blocking rate for prospective reservations. To remedy this situation, we propose a novel cross-layer resource allocation design. At the core of this design is a routing technique (called RTERU) that uses the allocated channel time as a routing metric. RTERU exploits the dependence of this metric on the multiple-rate capability of an UWB system. We show that selecting the route that consumes the minimum channel time while satisfying a target packet delivery probability over the selected route is an NP-hard problem. Accordingly, RTERU resorts to approximate path selection algorithms (implemented proactively and reactively) to find near-optimal solutions at reasonable computational\/communication overhead. We further enhance the performance of RTERU by integrating into its design a packet overhearing capability. Simulations are used to demonstrate the performance of our proposed solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25019","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25019","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25020","fieldValue":" We develop an efficient importance sampling algorithm for estimating the tail distribution of heavy-tailed compound sums, that is, random variables of the form $SM&equals;Z1+&cdots;+Z_M where the Zi's are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables in R and M is a nonnegative, integer-valued random variable independent of the Zi's. We construct the first estimator that can be rigorously shown to be strongly efficient only under the assumption that the Zi$'s are subexponential and M is light-tailed. Our estimator is based on state-dependent importance sampling and we use Lyapunov-type inequalities to control its second moment. The performance of our estimator is empirically illustrated in various instances involving popular heavy-tailed models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25020","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25020","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25021","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of the exact simulation of random variables Z that satisfy the distributional identity Z $&equals;^L VY + (1-V)Z, where V âˆˆ [0,1] and Y are independent, and &equals;L$ denotes equality in distribution. Equivalently, Z is the limit of a Markov chain driven by that map. We give an algorithm that can be automated under the condition that we have a source capable of generating independent copies of Y, and that V has a density that can be evaluated in a black-box format. The method uses a doubling trick for inducing coalescence in coupling from the past. Applications include exact samplers for many Dirichlet means, some two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet means, and a host of other distributions related to occupation times of Bessel bridges that can be described by stochastic fixed point equations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25021","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25021","fieldValue":"ACM"}
