However, these methods suffer from two problems due to the diversity and uneven distribution of source sentences. First, their performance is highly dependent on the choice of a development set, which may lead to an unstable performance for testing. Second, the sentence level translation quality is not assured since tuning is performed on the document level rather than on sentence level. In contrast with the standard global training in which a single weight is learned, we propose novel local training methods to address these two problems. We perform training and testing in one step by locally learning the sentence-wise weight for each input sentence. Since the time of each tuning step is unnegligible and learning sentence-wise weights for the entire test set means many passes of tuning, it is a great challenge for the efficiency of local training. We propose an efficient two-phase method to put the local training into practice by employing the ultraconservative update. On NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks with both medium and large scales of training data, our local training methods significantly outperform standard methods with the maximal improvements up to 2.0 BLEU points, meanwhile their efficiency is comparable to that of the standard methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3048","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3048","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21500","fieldValue":" Most communication and localization algorithms in underwater environments have been constrained by dependencies on the Line Of Sight (LOS), which is hard to guarantee due to the inherent node mobility. This constraint hinders node discovery and ad hoc formation in underwater networks and limits the performance of routing protocols. This article introduces a novel Surface-Based Reflection (SBR) model that uses a homomorphic deconvolution technique to establish water-surface-reflected communication links. We then propose a Surface-Based Reflection Anchor-free Localization (SBR-AL) algorithm that can be employed by the individual nodes to establish a relative coordinate system. Our approach also employs a switch-beamed directional antenna model that allows each node to use the LOS estimated from SBR-AL to enable directional communication which is beneficial for higher Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). The relative locations can facilitate the various network operation functions such as geo-routing and collision-free medium access. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21500","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21500","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21501","fieldValue":" In this article, we address a new unexplored problem: what are the optimal patterns to achieve connected coverage in wireless networks with directional antennas. As their name implies, directional antennas can focus their transmission energy in a certain direction. This feature leads to lower cross-interference and larger communication distance. It has been shown that, with proper scheduling mechanisms, directional antennas may substantially improve networking performance in wireless networks. In this article, we propose a set of deployment patterns to achieve full coverage and up to 2-connectivity under two different antenna models, namely the sector model and the knob model. These patterns are optimal under most combinations of communication and sensing ranges. We also introduce with detailed analysis several fundamental theorems and conjectures. Finally, we examine a more realistic physical model, where there might be strong interference and both the sensing range and the communication range might be irregular. The results show that our designed patterns work well even in unstable and fickle physical environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21501","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21501","fieldValue":"ACM"}
