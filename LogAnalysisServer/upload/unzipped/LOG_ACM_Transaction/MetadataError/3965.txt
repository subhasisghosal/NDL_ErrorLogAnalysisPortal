Some information required by existing software sizing methods is difficult to predict in the early stage of software development. A conceptual data model is widely used in the early stage of requirements analysis for information systems. Lines of code (LOC) is a commonly used software size measure. This article proposes a novel LOC estimation method for information systems from their conceptual data models through using a multiple linear regression model. We have validated the proposed method using samples from both the software industry and open-source systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22792","fieldValue":" Dynamic information flow analysis (DIFA) was devised to enable the flow of information among variables in an executing program to be monitored and possibly regulated. It is related to techniques like dynamic slicing and dynamic impact analysis. To better understand the basis for DIFA, we conducted an empirical study in which we measured the strength of information flows identified by DIFA, using information theoretic and correlation-based methods. The results indicate that in most cases the occurrence of a chain of dynamic program dependences between two variables does not indicate a measurable information flow between them. We also explored the relationship between the strength of an information flow and the length of the corresponding dependence chain, and we obtained results indicating that no consistent relationship exists between the length of an information flow and its strength. Finally, we investigated whether data dependence and control dependence makes equal or unequal contributions to flow strength. The results indicate that flows due to data dependences alone are stronger, on average, than flows due to control dependences alone. We present the details of our study and consider the implications of the results for applications of DIFA and related techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22793","fieldValue":" Business service engagements involve processes that extend across two or more autonomous organizations. Because of regulatory and competitive reasons, requirements for cross-organizational business processes often evolve in subtle ways. The changes may concern the business transactions supported by a process, the organizational structure of the parties participating in the process, or the contextual policies that apply to the process. Current business process modeling approaches handle such changes in an ad hoc manner, and lack a principled means for determining what needs to be changed and where. Cross-organizational settings exacerbate the shortcomings of traditional approaches because changes in one organization can potentially affect the workings of another. This article describes Amoeba, a methodology for business processes that is based on business protocols. Protocols capture the business meaning of interactions among autonomous parties via commitments. Amoeba includes guidelines for (1) specifying cross-organizational processes using business protocols, and (2) handling the evolution of requirements via a novel application of protocol composition. This article evaluates Amoeba using enhancements of a real-life business scenario of auto-insurance claim processing, and an aerospace case study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22793","fieldValue":"ACM"}
