In this framework, some nodes cooperate with a nearby node that acts as a relay, using the decode-and-forward protocol, and others use direct transmission. The network is modeled as an independently marked Poisson point process, and the source nodes may choose their relays from the set of inactive nodes. Although cooperation can potentially lead to significant improvements in the performance of a communication pair, relaying causes additional interference in the network, increasing the average noise that other nodes see. We investigate how source nodes should balance cooperation versus interference to obtain reliable transmissions, and for this purpose, we study and optimize a relay activation strategy with respect to the outage probability. Surprisingly, in the high reliability regime, the optimized strategy consists on the activation of all the relays or none at all, depending on network parameters. We provide a simple closed-form expression that indicates when the relays should be active, and we introduce closed-form expressions that quantify the performance gains of this scheme with respect to a network that only uses direct transmission."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10626","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10627","fieldValue":"Lee, Hyang-Won"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10627","fieldValue":" We study the reliability maximization problem in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks with random link failures. Reliability in these networks is defined as the probability that the logical network is connected, and it is determined by the underlying lightpath routing, network topologies, and the link failure probability. By introducing the notion of lexicographical ordering for lightpath routings, we characterize precise optimization criteria for maximum reliability in the low failure probability regime. Based on the optimization criteria, we develop lightpath routing algorithms that maximize the reliability, and logical topology augmentation algorithms for further improving reliability. We also study the reliability maximization problem in the high failure probability regime."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10627","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
