Considering this shortcoming, we propose a feature selection algorithm in gene expression data analysis of sample classifications. The proposed algorithm first divides genes into subsets, the sizes of which are relatively small (roughly of size h), then selects informative smaller subsets of genes (of size r < h) from a subset and merges the chosen genes with another gene subset (of size r) to update the gene subset. We repeat this process until all subsets are merged into one informative subset. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by analyzing three distinct gene expression data sets. Our method shows promising classification accuracy for all the test data sets. We also show the relevance of the selected genes in terms of their biological functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4758","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4758","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4758","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4759","fieldValue":" Ab initio protein structure prediction methods first generate large sets of structural conformations as candidates (called decoys), and then select the most representative decoys through clustering techniques. Classical clustering methods are inefficient due to the pairwise distance calculation, and thus become infeasible when the number of decoys is large. In addition, the existing clustering approaches suffer from the arbitrariness in determining a distance threshold for proteins within a cluster: a small distance threshold leads to many small clusters, while a large distance threshold results in the merging of several independent clusters into one cluster. In this paper, we propose an efficient clustering method through fast estimating cluster centroids and efficient pruning rotation spaces. The number of clusters is automatically detected by information distance criteria. A package named ONION, which can be downloaded freely, is implemented accordingly. Experimental results on benchmark data sets suggest that ONION is 14 times faster than existing tools, and ONION obtains better selections for 31 targets, and worse selection for 19 targets compared to SPICKER's selections. On an average PC, ONION can cluster 100,000 decoys in around 12 minutes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4759","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
