It is initially shown that full-band clarity index $C_50$ is the most correlated measure on average with reverberant speech recognition performance. This corroborates previous findings but now for the dataset to be used in this study. We extend the previous findings to show that C50 also exhibits the highest mutual information on average. Motivated by these extended findings, a nonintrusive room acoustic (NIRA) estimation method is proposed to estimate C50 from only the reverberant speech signal. The NIRA method is a data-driven approach based on computing a number of features from the speech signal and it employs these features to train a model used to perform the estimation. The choice of features and learning techniques are explored in this work using an evaluation set which comprises approximately 100 000 different reverberant signals (around 93 h of speech) including reverberation from measured and simulated room impulse responses. The feature importance of each feature with respect to the estimation of the target C50 is analysed following two different approaches. In both cases, the newly chosen set of features shows high importance for the target. The best C50 estimator provides a root-mean-square deviation around 3 dB on average for all reverberant test environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4017","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4017","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4017","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4018","fieldValue":"Su, Ming-Hsiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4018","fieldValue":"Wu, Chung-Hsien"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4018","fieldValue":"Zheng, Yu-Ting"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4018","fieldValue":" In dyadic conversations, turn-taking is a dynamically evolving behavior strongly linked to paralinguistic communication. Turn-taking temporal evolution in a dyadic conversation is inevitable and can be incorporated into a modeling framework for characterizing and recognizing the personality traits (PTs) of two speakers. This study presents an approach to automatically predicting PTs in a dyadic conversation. First, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was used to model the relationship between Big Five Inventory 10 (BFI-10) items and linguistic features of spoken text in each turn of a speaker (speaker turn) to output a BFI-10 profile. The RNN applies a recurrent property to characterize the short-term temporal evolution of a dialog. Second, the coupled hidden Markov model (C-HMM) was employed to model the long-term turn-taking temporal evolution and cross-speaker contextual information for detecting the PTs of two individuals for the entire dialog represented by the BFI-10 profile sequence. The Mandarin Conversational Dialogue Corpus was used for evaluation. The evaluation result shows that an average perception accuracy of 79.66% for the big five traits was achieved using five-fold cross validation. Compared with conventional HMM and support vector machine-based methods, the proposed approach achieved a more favorable performance according to a statistical significance test. The encouraging results confirm the usability of this system for future applications."}
