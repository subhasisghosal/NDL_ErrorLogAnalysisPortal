{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24726","fieldValue":" Eliminating the boundary effects is an important issue for a large-scale personal communication service (PCS) network simulation. A PCS network is often modeled by a network of hexagonal cells. The boundary may significantly bias the ouput statistics if the number of hexagonal cells is small in a PCS network simulation. On the other hand, if the simulation is to be completed within a reasonable time on the available computing resources, the number of cells in the simulation cannot be too large. To avoid the inaccuracy caused by the boundary effect for a PCS network simulation with limited computing resources, we propose wrapping the hexagonal mesh into a homogeneous graph (i.e., all nodes in the graph are topologically identical). We show that by using the wrapped hexagonal mesh, the inaccuracy of the output measures can be limited even though the number of cells in the simulation is small. We can thus obtain the same statistical accuracy while using significantly less computation power than required for a simulation without cell wrapping."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24726","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24726","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24727","fieldValue":" Pseudorandom vectors are of importance for parallelized simulation methods. In this article we carry out a detailed analysis of the inversive method for the generation of uniform pseudorandom vectors. This method can be viewed as an analog of the inversive congruential method for pseudorandom number generation. We study, in particular, the periodicity properties and the behavior under the serial test for sequences of pseudorandom vectors generated by the inversive method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24727","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24727","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24728","fieldValue":"OBrien, George L."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24728","fieldValue":" Necessary and sufficient conditions on a function fp are given for the existence of a simulation procedureto simulate a Bernoulli variable with success probabilityfp from independent Bernoulli variables with successprobability p, with p being constrained to lie in a subsetP of [0,1] but otherwise unknown."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24728","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24728","fieldValue":"ACM"}
