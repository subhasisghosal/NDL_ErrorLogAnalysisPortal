{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10579","fieldValue":" We study the performance of noncooperative networks in light of three major topology design considerations, namely the price of establishing a link, path delay, and path proneness to congestion, the latter being modeled through the \"relaying extent\" of the nodes. We analyze these considerations and the tradeoffs between them from a game-theoretic perspective, where each network element attempts to optimize its individual performance. We show that for all considered cases but one, the existence of a Nash equilibrium point is guaranteed. For the latter case, we indicate, by simulations, that practical scenarios tend to admit a Nash equilibrium. In addition, we demonstrate that the price of anarchy, i.e., the performance penalty incurred by noncooperative behavior, may be prohibitively large; yet, we also show that such games usually admit at least one Nash equilibrium that is system-wide optimal, i.e., their price of stability is 1. This finding suggests that a major improvement can be achieved by providing a central (\"social\") agent with the ability to impose the initial configuration on the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10579","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10580","fieldValue":"Bremler-Barr, Anat"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10580","fieldValue":" A central component in all contemporary intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is their pattern matching algorithms, which are often based on constructing and traversing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that represents the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gb\/s with low power consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10580","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10580","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10580","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10581","fieldValue":" We analyze the effects of dynamic optical circuit setup on IP routing in general and on two routing mechanisms in particular, i.e., explicit routing and shortest-path-first routing. We present analytical models for computing the size and placement of optical circuits and propose model adaptations driven by the IP router system design. The results show that without careful consideration of intrinsic capabilities of IP routing protocol and forwarding, the size and location of optical circuits used can be vastly underestimated, also leading to significant disruptions in real networks. We present the Optical Bypass mechanisms and show that these methods, unlike traditional IP routing-based solutions, affect a comparatively lower number of IP routes and can be computed near-optimally, even under unknown traffic matrix conditions, making them effective and feasible."}
