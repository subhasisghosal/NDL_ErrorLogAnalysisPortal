Our solution is based on a transform that defines an isometry between curves on the 2D image manifold in 5D and the real line. This transform preserves the geodesic distance between points on these curves, adaptively warping the input signal so that 1D edge-preserving filtering can be efficiently performed in linear time. We demonstrate three realizations of 1D edge-preserving filters, show how to produce high-quality 2D edge-preserving filters by iterating 1D-filtering operations, and empirically analyze the convergence of this process. Our approach has several desirable features: the use of 1D operations leads to considerable speedups over existing techniques and potential memory savings; its computational cost is not affected by the choice of the filter parameters; and it is the first edge-preserving filter to work on color images at arbitrary scales in real time, without resorting to subsampling or quantization. We demonstrate the versatility of our domain transform and edge-preserving filters on several real-time image and video processing tasks including edge-preserving filtering, depth-of-field effects, stylization, recoloring, colorization, detail enhancement, and tone mapping."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16468","fieldValue":"HaCohen, Yoav"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16468","fieldValue":" This paper presents a new efficient method for recovering reliable local sets of dense correspondences between two images with some shared content. Our method is designed for pairs of images depicting similar regions acquired by different cameras and lenses, under non-rigid transformations, under different lighting, and over different backgrounds. We utilize a new coarse-to-fine scheme in which nearest-neighbor field computations using Generalized PatchMatch [Barnes et al. 2010] are interleaved with fitting a global non-linear parametric color model and aggregating consistent matching regions using locally adaptive constraints. Compared to previous correspondence approaches, our method combines the best of two worlds: It is dense, like optical flow and stereo reconstruction methods, and it is also robust to geometric and photometric variations, like sparse feature matching. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method using three applications for automatic example-based photograph enhancement: adjusting the tonal characteristics of a source image to match a reference, transferring a known mask to a new image, and kernel estimation for image deblurring."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16468","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16468","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16469","fieldValue":"OBrien, James F."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16469","fieldValue":" Cloth often has complicated nonlinear, anisotropic elastic behavior due to its woven pattern and fiber properties. However, most current cloth simulation techniques simply use linear and isotropic elastic models with manually selected stiffness parameters. Such simple simulations do not allow differentiating the behavior of distinct cloth materials such as silk or denim, and they cannot model most materials with fidelity to their real-world counterparts. In this paper, we present a data-driven technique to more realistically animate cloth. We propose a piecewise linear elastic model that is a good approximation to nonlinear, anisotropic stretching and bending behaviors of various materials. We develop new measurement techniques for studying the elastic deformations for both stretching and bending in real cloth samples. Our setup is easy and inexpensive to construct, and the parameters of our model can be fit to observed data with a well-posed optimization procedure. We have measured a database of ten different cloth materials, each of which exhibits distinctive elastic behaviors. These measurements can be used in most cloth simulation systems to create natural and realistic clothing wrinkles and shapes, for a range of different materials."}
