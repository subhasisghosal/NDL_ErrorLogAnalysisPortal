Assuming that nodes set prices to maximize their own net benefit, we characterize the equilibria of the resulting market. In addition, we propose an iterative algorithm for the nodes to adapt their price and rate allocation, and study its convergence behavior. We use a numerical case study to illustrate our results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9409","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9410","fieldValue":" A multi-hop network of wireless sensors can be used to gather spatio-temporal samples of a physical phenomenon and transmit these samples to a processing center. This paper addresses an important issue in the design of such networks: determining the spatio-temporal sampling rate of the network under conditions of minimum energy usage. A new collision-free protocol for gathering sensor data is used to obtain analytical results that characterize the tradeoffs among sensor density, energy usage, throughput, delay, temporal sampling rates and spatial sampling rates in wireless sensor networks. We also show that the lower bound on the delay incurred in gathering data is $O(k^2$n) in a clustered network of n sensors with at most k hops between any sensor and its clusterhead (CH). Simulation results on the tradeoff between the achievable spatial sampling rates and the achievable temporal sampling rates when IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) is used as the media access scheme are provided and compared with the analytical results obtained in this paper."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9410","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9411","fieldValue":" We show that determining the minimum number of resolve filters that need to be added to a set of two-dimensional (2-D) prefix filters so that the filter set can implement a given policy using the first-matching-rule-in-table tie breaker is NP-hard. Additionally, we develop a fast O(nlogn + s) time, n where is the number of filters and s is the number of conflicts, plane-sweep algorithm to detect and report all pairs of conflicting 2-D prefix filters. The space complexity of our algorithm is O(n). On our test set of 15 2-D filter sets, our algorithm runs between 4 and 17 times as fast as the 2-D trie algorithm of A. Hari et al. (2000) and uses between 1\/4th and 1\/8th the memory used by the algorithm of Hari et al. On the same test set, our algorithm is between 4 and 27 times as fast as the bit-vector algorithm of Baboescu and Varghese (2002) and uses between 1\/205 and 1\/6 as much memory. We introduce the notion of an essential resolve filter and develop an efficient algorithm to determine the essential resolve filters of a prefix filter set."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9411","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
