It is possible to search these databases using a keyword search. This makes it possible for designers to easily include existing content into new scenes. In this paper, we describe a method for context-based search of 3D scenes. We first downloaded a large set of scene graphs from Google 3D Warehouse. These scene graphs were segmented into individual objects. We also extracted tags from the names of the models. Given the object shape, tags, and spatial relationship between pairs of objects, we can predict the strength of a relationship between a candidate model and an existing object in the scene. Using this function, we can perform context-based queries. The user specifies a region in the scene they are modeling using a 3D bounding box, and the system returns a list of related objects. We show that context-based queries perform better than keyword queries alone, and that without any keywords our algorithm still returns a relevant set of models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2554","fieldValue":" Two mobile agents (robots) with distinct labels have to meet in an arbitrary, possibly infinite, unknown connected graph or in an unknown connected terrain in the plane. Agents are modeled as points, and the route of each of them only depends on its label and on the unknown environment. The actual walk of each agent also depends on an asynchronous adversary that may arbitrarily vary the speed of the agent, stop it, or even move it back and forth, as long as the walk of the agent is continuous, does not leave its route and covers all of it. Meeting in a graph means that both agents must be at the same time in some node or in some point inside an edge of the graph, while meeting in a terrain means that both agents must be at the same time in some point of the terrain. Does there exist a deterministic algorithm that allows any two agents to meet in any unknown environment in spite of this very powerful adversary&quest; We give deterministic rendezvous algorithms for agents starting at arbitrary nodes of any anonymous connected graph (finite or infinite) and for agents starting at any interior points with rational coordinates in any closed region of the plane with path-connected interior. In the geometric scenario agents may have different compasses and different units of length. While our algorithms work in a very general setting -- agents can, indeed, meet almost everywhere -- we show that none of these few limitations imposed on the environment can be removed. On the other hand, our algorithm also guarantees the following approximate rendezvous for agents starting at arbitrary interior points of a terrain as previously stated agents will eventually get to within an arbitrarily small positive distance from each other."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2554","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2554","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16396","fieldValue":" We introduce data-driven suggestions for 3D modeling. Data-driven suggestions support open-ended stages in the 3D modeling process, when the appearance of the desired model is ill-defined and the artist can benefit from customized examples that stimulate creativity. Our approach computes and presents components that can be added to the artist's current shape. We describe shape retrieval and shape correspondence techniques that support the generation of data-driven suggestions, and report preliminary experiments with a tool for creative prototyping of 3D models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16396","fieldValue":"ACM"}
