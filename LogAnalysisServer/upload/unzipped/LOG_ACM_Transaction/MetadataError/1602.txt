{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15836","fieldValue":" We present an algorithm that generates natural and intuitive deformations via direct manipulation for a wide range of shape representations and editing scenarios. Our method builds a space deformation represented by a collection of affine transformations organized in a graph structure. One transformation is associated with each graph node and applies a deformation to the nearby space. Positional constraints are specified on the points of an embedded object. As the user manipulates the constraints, a nonlinear minimization problem is solved to find optimal values for the affine transformations. Feature preservation is encoded directly in the objective function by measuring the deviation of each transformation from a true rotation. This algorithm addresses the problem of \"embedded deformation\" since it deforms space through direct manipulation of objects embedded within it, while preserving the embedded objects' features. We demonstrate our method by editing meshes, polygon soups, mesh animations, and animated particle systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15837","fieldValue":" We present mesh puppetry, a variational framework for detail-preserving mesh manipulation through a set of high-level, intuitive, and interactive design tools. Our approach builds upon traditional rigging by optimizing skeleton position and vertex weights in an integrated manner. New poses and animations are created by specifying a few desired constraints on vertex positions, balance of the character, length and rigidity preservation, joint limits, and\/or self-collision avoidance. Our algorithm then adjusts the skeleton and solves for the deformed mesh simultaneously through a novel cascading optimization procedure, allowing realtime manipulation of meshes with 50K+ vertices for fast design of pleasing and realistic poses. We demonstrate the potential of our framework through an interactive deformation platform and various applications such as deformation transfer and motion retargeting."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15837","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15837","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15838","fieldValue":" We introduce a simple technique that enables robust approximation of volumetric, large-deformation dynamics for real-time or large-scale offline simulations. We propose Lattice Shape Matching, an extension of deformable shape matching to regular lattices with embedded geometry; lattice vertices are smoothed by convolution of rigid shape matching operators on local lattice regions, with the effective mechanical stiffness specified by the amount of smoothing via region width. Since the na√Øve method can be very slow for stiff models - per-vertex costs scale cubically with region width - we provide a fast summation algorithm, Fast Lattice Shape Matching (FastLSM), that exploits the inherent summation redundancy of shape matching and can provide large-region matching at constant per-vertex cost. With this approach, large lattices can be simulated in linear time. We present several examples and benchmarks of an efficient CPU implementation, including many dozens of soft bodies simulated at real-time rates on a typical desktop machine."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15839","fieldValue":"Au, Oscar Kin-Chung"}
