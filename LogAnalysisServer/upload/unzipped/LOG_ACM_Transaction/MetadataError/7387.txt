Unlike traditional IP multicast, the nonleaf nodes in the tree are normal end hosts, which are potentially more susceptible to failures than routers and may leave the multicast group voluntarily. In these cases, all downstream nodes are affected. Thus, an important problem for making overlay multicast more dependable is how to recover from node departures in order to minimize the disruption of service to those affected nodes. In this paper, we propose a proactive tree recovery mechanism to make the overlay multicast resilient to these failures and unexpected events. Rather than letting downstream nodes try to find a new parent after a node departure, each non-leaf node precalculates a parent-to-be for each of its children. When this non-leaf node is gone, all its children can find their respective new parents immediately. The salient feature of the approach is that rescue plans for multiple non-leaf nodes can work together for their respective children when they fail or leave at the same time. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proactive approach can recover from node departures much faster than reactive methods, while the quality of trees restored and the cost of recovery are reasonable."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9585","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9585","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9585","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1865","fieldValue":" The performance of graphics processing unit (GPU) systems is improving rapidly to accommodate the increasing demands of graphics and high-performance computing applications. With such a performance improvement, however, power consumption of GPU systems is dramatically increased. Up to 30&percnt; of the total power of a GPU system is consumed by the graphic memory itself. Therefore, reducing graphics memory power consumption is critical to mitigate the power challenge. In this article, we propose an energy-efficient reconfigurable 3D die-stacking graphics memory design that integrates wide-interface graphics DRAMs side-by-side with a GPU processor on a silicon interposer. The proposed architecture is a â\u20ACœ3D&plus;2.5Dâ\u20AC? system, where the DRAM memory itself is 3D stacked memory with through-silicon via (TSV), whereas the integration of DRAM and the GPU processor is through the interposer solution (2.5D). Since GPU computing units, memory controllers, and memory are all integrated in the same package, the number of memory I\/Os is no longer constrained by the packageâ\u20AC™s pin count. We can reduce the memory power consumption by scaling down the supply voltage and frequency of memory interface while maintaining the same or even higher peak memory bandwidth. In addition, we design a reconfigurable memory interface that can dynamically adapt to the requirements of various applications. We propose two reconfiguration mechanisms to optimize the GPU system energy efficiency and throughput, respectively, and thus benefit both memory-intensive and compute-intensive applications. The experimental results show that the proposed GPU memory architecture can effectively improve GPU system energy efficiency by 21&percnt;, without reconfiguration. The reconfigurable memory interface can further improve the system energy efficiency by 26&percnt;, and system throughput by 31&percnt; under a capped system power budget of 240W."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1865","fieldValue":"Optimizing GPU energy efficiency with 3D die-stacking graphics memory and reconfigurable memory interface"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1865","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1865","fieldValue":"ACM"}
