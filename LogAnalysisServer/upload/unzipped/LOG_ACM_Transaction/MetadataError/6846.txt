But discovering how to target the most valuable web visitors and generate a high response rate is still a challenge for advertising intermediaries and advertisers. The purpose of this study is to examine how behavioral targeting (BT) impacts usersâ\u20AC™ responses to online ads and particularly whether BT works better in combination with contextual targeting (CT). Using a large, individual-level clickstream data set of an automobile advertising campaign from an Internet advertising intermediary, this study examines the impact of BT and CT strategies on usersâ\u20AC™ click behavior. The results show that (1) targeting a user with behavioral characteristics that are closely related to ads does not necessarily increase the click through rates (CTRs); whereas, targeting a user with behavioral characteristics that are loosely related to ads leads to a higher CTR, and (2) BT and CT work better in combination. Our study contributes to online advertising design literature and provides important managerial implications for advertising intermediaries and advertisers on targeting individual users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8254","fieldValue":"Lui, Tsz-Wai"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8254","fieldValue":" Customer service is an important competitive lever for the modern firm. At the same time, the continuous evolution and performance improvements in information technology (IT) capabilities have enabled the utilization of multichannel service delivery strategies. Our research focuses on IT-enabled customer service systems (CSS) and their effect on firm performance. Previous studies have failed to find a consensus on the effect of a new self-service channel on the firm's performance. We argue that the embedded assumptions underpinning the previous research are responsible for these mixed findings. Consequently, using archival data from 169 hotels affiliated with a hotel chain, we designed a longitudinal multichannel study to resolve some of these inconsistencies. Our results illustrate that when firms implement an IT-enabled self-service channel to complement their existing customer service infrastructure, they experience an early negative effect on financial performance due to the disruption of the service processes. Thus, the multichannel CSS generates a positive effect only when the new process becomes a stable part of the organizational procedures. Our findings suggest that researchers evaluate the effect of a technological initiative after the new business process has been stabilized and consider that an additional IT-enabled self-service channel rarely operates in isolation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8254","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8254","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8255","fieldValue":" In most BPM systems (a.k.a. workflow systems), the data for process execution is scattered across databases for enterprise, auxiliary local data stores within the BPM systems, and even file systems (e.g., specification of process models). The interleaving nature of data management and BP execution and the lack of a coherent conceptual data model for all data needed for execution make it hard for (1) providing Business-Process-as-a-Service (BPaaS) and (2) effective support for collaboration between business processes. The primary reason is that an enormous effort is required for maintaining both the engines and the data for the client applications. In particular, different modeling languages and different BPM systems make process interoperation one of the toughest challenges. In this article, we formulate a concept of a â\u20ACœuniversal artifact,â\u20AC? which extends artifact-centric models by capturing all needed data for a process instance throughout its execution. A framework called SeGA based on universal artifacts is developed to support separation of data and BP execution, a key principle for BPM systems. We demonstrate in this article that SeGA is versatile enough to fully facilitate not only executions of individual processes (to support BPaaS) but also various collaboration models. Moreover, SeGA reduces the complexity in runtime management including runtime querying, constraints enforcement, and dynamic modification upon collaboration across possibly different BPM systems."}
