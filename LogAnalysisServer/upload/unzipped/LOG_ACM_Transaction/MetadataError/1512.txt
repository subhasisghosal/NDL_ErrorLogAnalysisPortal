Our method operates by decomposing the radiance field close to surfaces into separate far- and near-field components that can be approximated individually. By computing surface shading using these approximations, instead of directly querying the global illumination solution, we have been able to obtain rendering time speed ups on the order of 10x compared to previous acceleration methods. Our approximation schemes rely mainly on the assumptions that radiance due to distant objects will exhibit low spatial and angular variation, and that the visibility between a surface and nearby surfaces can be reasonably predicted by simple location and orientation-based heuristics. Motivated by these assumptions, our far-field scheme uses scattered-data interpolation with spherical harmonics to represent spatial and angular variation, and our near-field scheme employs an aggressively simple visibility heuristic. For our test scenes, the errors introduced when our assumptions fail do not result in visually objectionable artifacts or easily noticeable deviation from a ground-truth solution. We also discuss how our near-field approximation can be used with standard local illumination algorithms to produce significantly improved images at only negligible additional cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15603","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15603","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15604","fieldValue":" We present a signal-processing framework for light transport. We study the frequency content of radiance and how it is altered by phenomena such as shading, occlusion, and transport. This extends previous work that considered either spatial or angular dimensions, and it offers a comprehensive treatment of both space and angle.We show that occlusion, a multiplication in the primal, amounts in the Fourier domain to a convolution by the spectrum of the blocker. Propagation corresponds to a shear in the space-angle frequency domain, while reflection on curved objects performs a different shear along the angular frequency axis. As shown by previous work, reflection is a convolution in the primal and therefore a multiplication in the Fourier domain. Our work shows how the spatial components of lighting are affected by this angular convolution.Our framework predicts the characteristics of interactions such as caustics and the disappearance of the shadows of small features. Predictions on the frequency content can then be used to control sampling rates for rendering. Other potential applications include precomputed radiance transfer and inverse rendering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15604","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15604","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15605","fieldValue":"Wong, Tien-Tsin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15605","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15605","fieldValue":" Weathering modeling introduces blemishes such as dirt, rust, cracks and scratches to virtual scenery. In this paper we present a visual stimulation technique that works well for a wide variety of weathering phenomena. Our technique, called γ-ton tracing, is based on a type of aging-inducing particles called γ-tons. Modeling a weathering effect with γ-ton tracing involves tracing a large number of γ-tons through the scene in a way similar to photon tracing and then generating the weathering effect using the recorded γ-ton transport information. With this technique, we can produce weathering effects that are customized to the scene geometry and tailored to the weathering sources. Several effects that are challenging for existing techniques can be readily captured by γ-ton tracing. These include global transport effects. or \"stainbleeding\". γ-ton tracing also enables visual simulations of complex multi-weathering effects. Lastly γ-ton tracing can generate weathering effects that not only involve texture changes but also large-scale geometry changes. We demonstrate our technique with a variety of examples."}
