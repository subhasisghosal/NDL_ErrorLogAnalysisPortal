This paper proposes a novel tumor classification method based on correlation filters to identify the overall pattern of tumor subtype hidden in differentially expressed genes. Concretely, two correlation filters, i.e., Minimum Average Correlation Energy (MACE) and Optimal Tradeoff Synthetic Discriminant Function (OTSDF), are introduced to determine whether a test sample matches the templates synthesized for each subclass. The experiments on six publicly available data sets indicate that the proposed method is robust to noise, and can more effectively avoid the effects of dimensionality curse. Compared with many model-based methods, the correlation filter-based method can achieve better performance when balanced training sets are exploited to synthesize the templates. Particularly, the proposed method can detect the similarity of overall pattern while ignoring small mismatches between test sample and the synthesized template. And it performs well even if only a few training samples are available. More importantly, the experimental results can be visually represented, which is helpful for the further analysis of results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4742","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4742","fieldValue":"Correlation filters, gene expression profiles, tumor classification, template-based method, model-based method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4743","fieldValue":"Di Camillo, Barbara"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4743","fieldValue":" Studying biological networks at topological level is a major issue in computational biology studies and simulation is often used in this context, either to assess reverse engineering algorithms or to investigate how topological properties depend on network parameters. In both contexts, it is desirable for a topology simulator to reproduce the current knowledge on biological networks, to be able to generate a number of networks with the same properties and to be flexible with respect to the possibility to mimic networks of different organisms. We propose a biological network topology simulator, SimBioNeT, in which module structures of different type and size are replicated at different level of network organization and interconnected, so to obtain the desired degree distribution, e.g., scale free, and a clustering coefficient constant with the number of nodes in the network, a typical characteristic of biological networks. Empirical assessment of the ability of the simulator to reproduce characteristic properties of biological network and comparison with E. coli and S. cerevisiae transcriptional networks demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4743","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
