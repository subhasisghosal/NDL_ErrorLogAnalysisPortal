{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3035","fieldValue":" This article describes an algorithm for categorizing Arabic text, relying on highly categorized corpus-based datasets obtained from the Arabic Wikipedia by using manual and automated processes to build and customize categories. The categorization algorithm was built by adopting a simple categorization idea then moving forward to more complex ones. We applied tests and filtration criteria to reach the best and most efficient results that our algorithm can achieve. The categorization depends on the statistical relations between the input (test) text and the reference (training) data supported by well-defined Wikipedia-based categories. Our algorithm supports two levels for categorizing Arabic text; categories are grouped into a hierarchy of main categories and subcategories. This introduces a challenge due to the correlation between certain subcategories and overlap between main categories. We argue that our algorithm achieved good performance compared to other methods reported in the literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21352","fieldValue":" As wireless sensor networks utilize battery-operated nodes, energy efficiency is of paramount importance at all levels of system design. In order to save energy in the transfer of data from the sensor nodes to one or more sinks, the data may be routed through other nodes rather than transmitting it directly to the sink(s). In this article, we investigate the problem of energy-efficient transmission of data over a noisy channel, focusing on the setting of physical-layer parameters. We derive a metric called the energy per successfully received bit, which specifies the expected energy required to transmit a bit successfully over a particular distance given a channel noise model. By minimizing this metric, we can find, for different modulation schemes, the energy-optimal relay distance and the optimal transmit energy as a function of channel noise level and path loss exponent. These results enable network designers to select the hop distance, transmit power, and\/or modulation scheme that maximize network lifetime."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21352","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21352","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21353","fieldValue":"Chan, Aldar C-F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21353","fieldValue":" A formal treatment to the security of Concealed Data Aggregation (CDA) and the more general Private Data Aggregation (PDA) is given. While there exist a handful of constructions, rigorous security models and analyses for CDA or PDA are still lacking. Standard security notions for public key encryption, including semantic security and indistinguishability against chosen ciphertext attacks, are refined to cover the multisender nature and aggregation functionality of CDA and PDA in the security model. The proposed security model is sufficiently general to cover most application scenarios and constructions of privacy-preserving data aggregation. An impossibility result on achieving security against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks in CDA\/PDA is shown. A generic CDA construction based on public key homomorphic encryption is given, along with a proof of its security in the proposed model. The security of a number of existing schemes is analyzed in the proposed model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21353","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21353","fieldValue":"ACM"}
