These problems are often posed as under-determined linear inverse UDLI problems and solved in a centralized manner, where all the measurements are collected at a central node, which then applies a variety of inference techniques to estimate the attributes of interest. This paper proposes a novel framework for decentralizing these large-scale under-determined network inference problems by intelligently partitioning it into smaller subproblems and solving them independently and in parallel. The resulting estimates, referred to as multiple descriptions, can then be fused together to compute the global estimate. We apply this Multiple Description and Fusion Estimation MDFE framework to three classical problems: traffic matrix estimation, traffic matrix completion, and loss inference. Using real topologies and traces, we demonstrate how MDFE can speed up computation while maintaining even improving the estimation accuracy and how it enhances robustness against noise and failures. We also show that our MDFE framework is compatible with a variety of existing inference techniques used to solve the UDLI problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11030","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: HP-Labs., Palo Alto, CA, USA (Sharma, Puneet); Dept. of Comput.

This allocation can be computed by uniformly raising the bandwidths of all users without violating capacity constraints. We consider an extension of these allocations by raising the bandwidth with arbitrary and not necessarily uniform time-depending velocities allocation rates. These allocations are used in a game-theoretic context for routing choices, which we formalize in progressive filling games PFGs. We present a variety of results for equilibria in PFGs. We show that these games possess pure Nash and strong equilibria. While computation in general is NP-hard, there are polynomial-time algorithms for prominent classes of Max-Min-Fair Games MMFG, including the case when all users have the same source-destination pair. We characterize prices of anarchy and stability for pure Nash and strong equilibria in PFGs and MMFGs when players have different or the same source-destination pairs. In addition, we show that when a designer can adjust allocation rates, it is possible to design games with optimal strong equilibria. Some initial results on polynomial-time algorithms in this direction are also derived."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11031","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Heinz Nixdorf Institute (Skopalik, Alexander); Department of Mathematics, TU, Berlin, Germany (Schewior, Kevin); Dept. of Quantitative Econ., Maastricht Univ., Maastricht, Netherlands (Harks, Tobias); Max-Planck-Inst. fur Inf., Saarbru&#x0308;cken, Germany (Hoefer, Martin); Dept. of Math., Tech.
