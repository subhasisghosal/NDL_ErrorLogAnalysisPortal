Automated analyses of WCAG 2.0 Level A Success Criteria found high percentages of violations overall. Unlike more circumscribed studies, however, these sites exhibited improvements over the years on a number of accessibility indicators, with government sites being less likely than topsites to have accessibility violations. Examination of the causes of success and failure suggests that improving accessibility may be due, in part, to changes in website technologies and coding practices rather than a focus on accessibility per se."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23260","fieldValue":" Given only the URL of a Web page, can we identify its language? In this article we examine this question. URL-based language classification is useful when the content of the Web page is not available or downloading the content is a waste of bandwidth and time. We built URL-based language classifiers for English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian by applying a variety of algorithms and features. As algorithms we used machine learning algorithms which are widely applied for text classification and state-of-art algorithms for language identification of text. As features we used words, various sized n-grams, and custom-made features (our novel feature set). We compared our approaches with two baseline methods, namely classification by country code top-level domains and classification by IP addresses of the hosting Web servers. We trained and tested our classifiers in a 10-fold cross-validation setup on a dataset obtained from the Open Directory Project and from querying a commercial search engine. We obtained the lowest F1-measure for English (94) and the highest F1-measure for German (98) with the best performing classifiers. We also evaluated the performance of our methods: (i) on a set of Web pages written in Adobe Flash and (ii) as part of a language-focused crawler. In the first case, the content of the Web page is hard to extract and in the second page downloading pages of the â\u20ACœwrongâ\u20AC? language constitutes a waste of bandwidth. In both settings the best classifiers have a high accuracy with an F1-measure between 95 (for English) and 98 (for Italian) for the Adobe Flash pages and a precision between 90 (for Italian) and 97 (for French) for the language-focused crawler."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23260","fieldValue":"URL"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23260","fieldValue":"ACM"}
