We show how to manage the energy consumption of such an array by combining caching and prefetching techniques. We first examine how seek operations affect disk energy consumption, and then analyze the relationship between the amount of prefetched data and the number of seeks, and the effect of the size of the prefetching buffer on energy consumption. Based on this, we propose a new data prefetching scheme in which the amount of data prefetched for each video stream is dynamically adjusted to allow for the bit-rates of streams and the power characteristics of different disks. We next examine the impact of caching on disk power consumption and propose a new caching scheme that prioritizes each stream based on the ratio of the amount of energy that can be saved to its cache requirement, so as to make effective use of limited caching space. We address the trade-off between caching and prefetching and propose an algorithm that dynamically divides the entire buffer space into prefetching and caching regions, with the aim of minimizing overall disk energy consumption. Experimental results show that our scheme can reduce disk energy consumption between 26&percnt; and 31&percnt;, compared to a server without prefetching and caching."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25551","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25551","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25552","fieldValue":"Lau, Rynson W H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25552","fieldValue":" Distributed virtual environments (DVEs) are attracting a lot of attention in recent years, due to the increasing popularity of online gaming and social networks. As the number of concurrent users of a DVE increases, a critical problem is on how the workload among multiple servers can be balanced in order to maintain real-time performance. Although a number of load balancing methods have been proposed, they either try to produce high quality load balancing results and become too slow or emphasize on efficiency and the load balancing results become less effective. In this article, we propose a new approach to address this problem based on heat diffusion. Our work has two main contributions. First, we propose a local and a global load balancing methods for DVEs based on heat diffusion. Second, we investigate two performance factors of the proposed methods, the convergence threshold and the load balancing interval. We have conducted a number of experiments to extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform existing methods in that our methods are effective in reducing server overloading while at the same time being efficient."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25552","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25552","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25553","fieldValue":" The trend of replacing public static signages with digital displays creates opportunities for interactive display systems, which can be used in collaborative workspaces, social gaming platforms and advertising. Based on marketing communication concepts and existing models for consumer behavior, three stages, namely attraction, interaction and conation, are defined in this article to analyze the effectiveness of interactive display advertising. By reviewing various methods and strategies employed by existing systems with attraction, interaction and conation stages, this article concludes that smart mobile devices should be integrated as a component to increase the effectiveness of interactive displays as advertising tools. Future research challenges related to this topic are also discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25553","fieldValue":"ACM"}
