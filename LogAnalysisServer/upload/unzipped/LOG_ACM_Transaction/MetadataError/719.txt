A matching M is a set of edges, no two of which share an endpoint. An edge e &equals; (a, b) âˆˆ E&setmn; M is a blocking edge for M if a is either unmatched or strictly prefers b to its partner in M, and b is unmatched, strictly prefers a to its partner in M, or is indifferent between them. A matching is strongly stable if there is no blocking edge with respect to it. We give an O(nm) algorithm for computing strongly stable matchings, where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges. The previous best algorithm had running time $O(m^2). We also study this problem in the hospitals-residents setting, which is a many-to-one extension of the aforementioned problem.

The existing substrate routing algorithms often result in a large number of unrouted nets that have to be routed manually. This article develops an effective yet efficient diffusion-driven method D-Router to reduce congestion. Starting with an initial routing, we develop an effective diffusion-based congestion reduction. We iteratively find a congested window and spread out connections to reduce congestion inside the window by a simulated diffusion process based on the duality between congestion and concentration. The window is released after the congestion is eliminated. Compared with the state-of-the-art substrate routing method that leads to 480 nets unrouted for ten industrial designs with a total of 6415 nets, the D-Router reduces the amount of unrouted nets to 104, a reduction to the 4.6 multiple. In addition, the D-Router obtains a similar reduction on unrouted nets but runs up to 94 times faster when compared with a negotiation-based substrate routing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13186","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13186","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13187","fieldValue":"Choi, Kyu-Myung"}
