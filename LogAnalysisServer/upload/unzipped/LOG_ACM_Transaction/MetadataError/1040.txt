{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14166","fieldValue":" In many computer-based applications, temporal information has to be stored, retrieved, and related to other temporal information. Several time models have been proposed to manage temporal knowledge in the fields of conceptual modeling, database systems, and artificial intelligence.In this paper we present TSOS, a system for reasoning about time that can be integrated as a time expert in environments designed for broader problem-solving domains. The main intended goal of TSOS is to allow a user to infer further information on the temporal data stored in the database through a set of deduction rules handling various aspects of time. For this purpose, TSOS provides the capability of answering queries about the temporal specifications it has in its temporal database. Distinctive time-modeling features of TSOS are the introduction of temporal modalitites, i.e., the possibility of specifying if a piece of information is always true within a time interval, or if it is only sometimes true, and the capability of answering about the possibility and the necessity of the validity of some information at a given time, the association of temporal knowledge both to instances of data and to types of data, and the development of a time calculus for reasoning on temporal data. Another relevant feature of TSOS is the capability to reason about temporal data specified at different time granularities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14166","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14166","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2341","fieldValue":" The seat reservation problem is the problem of assigning passengers to seats on a train with n seats and k stations enroute in an online manner. The performance of algorithms for this problem is studied using the relative worst order ratio, a fairly new measure for the quality of online algorithms, which allows for direct comparisons between algorithms. This study has yielded new separations between algorithms. For example, for both variants of the problem considered, using the relative worst order ratio, First-Fit and Best-Fit are shown to be better than Worst-Fit."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2341","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2341","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14167","fieldValue":"El Abbadi, A."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14167","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present a low-cost fault-tolerant protocol for managing replicated data. We impose a logical tree structure on the set of copies of an object and develop a protocol that uses the information available in the logical structure to reduce the communication requirements for read and write operations. The tree quorum protocol is a generalization of the static voting protocol with two degrees of freedom for choosing quorums. In general, this results in significantly lower communication costs for comparable data availability. The protocol exhibits the property of graceful degradation, i.e., communication costs for executing operations are minimal in a failure-free environment but may increase as failures occur. This approach in designing distributed systems is desirable since it provides fault-tolerance without imposing unnecessary costs on the failure-free mode of operations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14167","fieldValue":"ACM"}
