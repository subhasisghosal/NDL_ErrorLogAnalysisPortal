Thisalgorithm has running time ofO(&mid;E&mid;nÏ?), which issignificantly faster than the previously known algorithm given inElkin and Peleg [2001], whose running time isÃ\u2022(n2&plus; Ï?$).

Cohen et al. established a Galois connection between finitely-generated weighted clones and finitely-generated weighted relational clones [SICOMPâ\u20AC™13], and asked whether this connection holds in general. We answer this question in the affirmative for weighted (relational) clones with real weights and show that the complexity of the corresponding valued CSPs is preserved."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12551","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12551","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12552","fieldValue":" A function defined on the Boolean hypercube is k-Fourier-sparse if it has at most k nonzero Fourier coefficients. For a function f: $$F_2$^n$ &rightarrow; R and parameters k and d, we prove a strong upper bound on the number of k-Fourier-sparse Boolean functions that disagree with f on at most d inputs. Our bound implies that the number of uniform and independent random samples needed for learning the class of k-Fourier-sparse Boolean functions on n variables exactly is at most O(n Â· klog k). As an application, we prove an upper bound on the query complexity of testing Booleanity of Fourier-sparse functions. Our bound is tight up to a logarithmic factor and quadratically improves on a result due to Gur and Tamuz [2013]."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12552","fieldValue":"ACM"}
