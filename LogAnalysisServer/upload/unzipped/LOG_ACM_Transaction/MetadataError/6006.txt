We present an exploration of modelling an example ubiquitous system, the Savannah game, using the mathematical formalism of bigraphs, which are based on a universal process algebra that encapsulates both dynamic and spatial behaviour of autonomous agents that interact and move among each other, or within each other. We establish a modelling approach based on four perspectives on ubiquitous systemsâ\u20AC\u201DComputational, Physical, Human, and Technologyâ\u20AC\u201Dand explore how these interact with one another. We show how our model explains observed inconsistencies in user trials of Savannah, and then, how formal analysis reveals an incompleteness in design and guides extensions of the model and\/or possible system re-design to resolve this."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5931","fieldValue":" Based on case studies from a heritage\/museum context, I present and illustrate the notion of â\u20ACœspatio-contextual embedding,â\u20AC? which conceptualizes installation designs that augment real objects and environments while keeping these primary focuses of attention. Key for this â\u20ACœembeddednessâ\u20AC? is that interaction is contextualized within a meaningful setting, creating relationships between system and environment. While retaining a focus on original objects or environments, it supports user's active engagement and sense making by inviting, enticing, or forcing them to draw connections. At the heart of this is â\u20ACœindexingâ\u20AC?: mindful acts of referencing back-and-forth between here and there, connecting objects or representations. Analysis of case studies provides a repertoire of examples of â\u20ACœindexing,â\u20AC? and examples for high- and low-tech installation designs that foster drawing of connections. Two core values for design underpin the argument: (1) primacy of real objects and environments and (2) supporting human agency. The case examples highlight how technological arrangements may support or hinder indexing activity. This is condensed into potential design strategies. This article contributes to design knowledge on design for human agency, sense making, and mindful engagement with our environment. â\u20ACœIndexingâ\u20AC? is relevant beyond the heritage setting domain, as part of HCI design in support of human agency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5931","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5931","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5932","fieldValue":" Displaying 3D objects on horizontal displays can cause problems in the way that the virtual scene is presented on the 2D surface; inappropriate choices in how 3D is represented can lead to distorted images and incorrect object interpretations. We present four experiments that test 3D perception. We varied projection geometry in three ways: type of projection (perspective\/parallel), separation between the observer's point of view and the projection's center (discrepancy), and the presence of motion parallax (with\/without parallax). Projection geometry had strong effects different for each task. Reducing discrepancy is desirable for orientation judgments, but not for object recognition or internal angle judgments. Using a fixed center of projection above the table reduces error and improves accuracy in most tasks. The results have far-reaching implications for the design of 3D views on tables, in particular, for multi-user applications where projections that appear correct for one person will not be perceived correctly by another."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5932","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5932","fieldValue":"ACM"}
