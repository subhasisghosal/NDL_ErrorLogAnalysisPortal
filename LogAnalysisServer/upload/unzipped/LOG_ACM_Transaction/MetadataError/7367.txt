{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9544","fieldValue":" OBEX (Object Exchange Protocol) is a session protocol designed to exchange all kind of objects between portable devices using different ad hoc wireless links including IrDA and Bluetooth. This paper develops a mathematical model for OBEX over the IrDA protocol stack by considering multiple applications and presence of bit errors. The model is also verified by simulation results. We derive throughput equations and carry out an optimization study focusing on four major parameters: OBEX packet size, TinyTP (IrDA transport layer) buffer size, IrLAP (IrDA link layer) frame and window size. Equations are derived for the optimum IrLAP windowand frame sizes. Numerical results show significant improvement on OBEX performance using the optimized parameters. The major contribution of this work is the modelling of OBEX including the low layer protocols and optimization of the overall throughput by appropriate parameter selection."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9544","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9544","fieldValue":"OBEX"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9544","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9544","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9545","fieldValue":" This paper addresses the problem of streaming packetized media over a lossy packet network through an intermediate proxy server to a client, in a rate-distortion optimized way. The proxy, located at the junction of the backbone network and the last hop to the client, coordinates the communication between the media server and the client using hybrid receiver\/sender-driven streaming in a rate-distortion optimization framework. The framework enables the proxy to determine at every instant which packets, if any, it should either request from the media server or (re)transmit directly to the client, in order to meet constraints on the average transmission rates on the backbone and the last hop while minimizing the average end-to-end distortion. Performance gains are observed over rate-distortion optimized sender-driven systems for streaming packetized video content. The improvement in performance depends on the quality of the network path both in the backbone network and along the last hop."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9545","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9545","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9545","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9546","fieldValue":"Wen, John Ting-Yung"}
