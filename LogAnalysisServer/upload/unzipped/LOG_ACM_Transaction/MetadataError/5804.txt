The negative correlation between genes may imply an important biological mechanism. In this study, we proposed a FCA-based negative correlation algorithm (NCFCA) that can effectively identify opposite expression tendency between two gene groups in gene expression data. After applying it to expression data of cell cycle-regulated genes in yeast, we found that six minichromosome maintenance family genes showed the opposite changing tendency with eight core histone family genes. Furthermore, we confirmed that the negative correlation expression pattern between these two families may be conserved in the cell cycle. Finally, we discussed the reasons underlying the negative correlation of six minichromosome maintenance (MCM) family genes with eight core histone family genes. Our results revealed that negative correlation is an important and potential mechanism that maintains the balance of biological systems by repressing some genes while inducing others. It can thus provide new understanding of gene expression and regulation, the causes of diseases, etc."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5315","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5315","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5315","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5316","fieldValue":"Liu, Jin-Xing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5316","fieldValue":"Gao, Ying-Lian"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5316","fieldValue":"Zheng, Chun-Hou"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5316","fieldValue":" With the development of deep sequencing technologies, many RNA-Seq data have been generated. Researchers have proposed many methods based on the sparse theory to identify the differentially expressed genes from these data. In order to improve the performance of sparse principal component analysis, in this paper, we propose a novel class-information-based sparse component analysis (CISCA) method which introduces the class information via a total scatter matrix. First, CISCA normalizes the RNA-Seq data by using a Poisson model to obtain their differential sections. Second, the total scatter matrix is gotten by combining the between-class and within-class scatter matrices. Third, we decompose the total scatter matrix by using singular value decomposition and construct a new data matrix by using singular values and left singular vectors. Then, aiming at obtaining sparse components, CISCA decomposes the constructed data matrix by solving an optimization problem with sparse constraints on loading vectors. Finally, the differentially expressed genes are identified by using the sparse loading vectors. The results on simulation and real RNA-Seq data demonstrate that our method is effective and suitable for analyzing these data."}
