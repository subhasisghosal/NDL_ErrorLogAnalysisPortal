It addresses the areas of audio, photo and video analysis for the purpose of indexing and retrieval from the perspective of a multimedia researcher. Whereas a general analysis of content is impossible due to the personal bias of the user, significant progress was made in the recognition of specific objects or events. The paper concludes with a brief outlook on the future."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25526","fieldValue":" This article emphasizes the need to refocus multimedia information retrieval (MIR) research towards bridging the utility gap, the gap between the expected and defacto usefulness of MIR solutions. This requires us to revisit the notion of relevance, but also to consider other criteria for assessing MIR solutions, like the informativeness of the retrieved results and how helpful they are for the users. The article also states that this focus shift cannot be realized incrementally, but by revisiting the foundations of MIR solutions, that is, by a utility-by-design approach. In this respect, a number of research challenges are proposed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25527","fieldValue":" The inaugural ACM Multimedia Conference coincided with a surge of interest in computer vision technologies for detecting and recognizing people and their activities in images and video. Face recognition was the first of these topics to broadly engage the vision and multimedia research communities. The Eigenfaces approach was, deservedly or not, the method that captured much of the initial attention, and it continues to be taught and used as a benchmark over 20 years later. This article is a brief personal view of the genesis of Eigenfaces for face recognition and its relevance to the multimedia community."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25527","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25527","fieldValue":"ACM"}
