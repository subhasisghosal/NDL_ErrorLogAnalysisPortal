FastME is such an approach that uses the {\\em balanced minimum evolution (BME)} principle, which computer studies have demonstrated to have high accuracy. FastME includes two variants: {\\em balanced subtree prune and regraft (BSPR)} and {\\em balanced nearest neighbor interchange (BNNI)}. These algorithms take as input a distance matrix and a putative phylogenetic tree. The tree is modified using SPR or NNI operations, respectively, to reduce the BME length relative to the distance matrix, until a tree with (locally) shortest BME length is found. Following computer simulations, it has been conjectured that BSPR and BNNI are consistent, i.e. for an input distance that is a tree-metric, they converge to the corresponding tree. We prove that the BSPR algorithm is consistent. Moreover, even if the input contains small errors relative to a tree-metric, we show that the BSPR algorithm still returns the corresponding tree. Whether BNNI is consistent remains open."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4405","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4405","fieldValue":"Phylogenetic tree, subtree prune and regraft (SPR), BSPR algorithm, Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI), BNNI algorithm, balanced minimum evolution principle (BME), tree-length, quartet-distance, Robinson Foulds distance, consistency, safety radius, topological move"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4405","fieldValue":"Consistency of Topological Moves Based on the Balanced Minimum Evolution Principle of Phylogenetic Inference"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4406","fieldValue":" Given a set X of taxa, a phylogenetic X-tree T that is only partially resolved, and a collection of characters on X, we consider the problem of finding a resolution (refinement) of T that minimizes the parsimony score of the given characters.

In this paper we provide a new algorithm for this problem, and show that it is fixed parameter tractable under more general conditions."}
