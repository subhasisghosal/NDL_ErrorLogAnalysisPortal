However, there has been a lack of research on the workload characterization of servers running SNS applications such as blog services. To fill this void, we empirically characterized real-world Web server logs collected from one of the largest South Korean blog hosting sites for 12 consecutive days. The logs consist of more than 96 million HTTP requests and 4.7TB of network traffic. Our analysis reveals the following: (i) The transfer size of nonmultimedia files and blog articles can be modeled using a truncated Pareto distribution and a log-normal distribution, respectively; (ii) user access for blog articles does not show temporal locality, but is strongly biased towards those posted with image or audio files. We additionally discuss the potential performance improvement through clustering of small files on a blog page into contiguous disk blocks, which benefits from the observed file access patterns. Trace-driven simulations show that, on average, the suggested approach achieves 60.6&percnt; better system throughput and reduces the processing time for file access by 30.8&percnt; compared to the best performance of the Ext4 filesystem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23255","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23255","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3269","fieldValue":" A novel biologically motivated face-recognition algorithm based on polar frequency is presented. Polar frequency descriptors are extracted from face images by Fourier--Bessel transform (FBT). Next, the Euclidean distance between all images is computed and each image is now represented by its dissimilarity to the other images. A pseudo-Fisher linear discriminant was built on this dissimilarity space. The performance of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) descriptors and a combination of both feature types was also evaluated. The algorithms were tested on a 40- and 1196-subjects face database (ORL and FERET, respectively). With five images per subject in the training and test datasets, error rate on the ORL database was 3.8, 1.25, and 0.2&percnt; for the FBT, DFT, and the combined classifier, respectively, as compared to 2.6&percnt; achieved by the best previous algorithm. The most informative polar frequency features were concentrated at low-to-medium angular frequencies coupled to low radial frequencies. On the FERET database, where an affine normalization preprocessing was applied, the FBT algorithm outperformed only the PCA in a rank recognition test. However, it achieved performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated by verification tests. These results indicate the high informative value of the polar frequency content of face images in relation to recognition and verification tasks and that the Cartesian frequency content can complement information about the subjects' identity, but possibly only when the images are not prenormalized. Possible implications for human face recognition are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3269","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3269","fieldValue":"ACM"}
