Techniques to minimize leakage have been researched widely. However, most approaches to reducing leakage have an associated performance penalty. In this article, we present an approach which minimizes leakage by simultaneously modifying the circuit while deriving the input vector that minimizes leakage. In our approach, we selectively modify a gate so that its output (in sleep mode) is in a state which helps minimize the leakage of other gates in its transitive fanout. Gate replacement is performed in a slack-aware manner, to minimize the resulting delay penalty. One of the major advantages of our technique is that we achieve a significant reduction in leakage without increasing the delay of the circuit."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13201","fieldValue":"ASIC"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13201","fieldValue":"A Simultaneous Input Vector Control and Circuit Modification Technique to Reduce Leakage with Zero Delay Penalty"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13202","fieldValue":"Wu, Yu-Ze"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13202","fieldValue":"Chao, Mango C-T"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13202","fieldValue":" This article presents several scan-cell reordering techniques to reduce the signal transitions during the test mode while preserving the donâ\u20AC™t-care bits in the test patterns for a later optimization. Combined with a pattern-filling technique, the proposed scan-cell reordering techniques can utilize both high response correlations and pattern correlations to simultaneously minimize scan-out and scan-in transitions. Those scan-shift transitions can be further reduced by selectively using the inverse connections between scan cells. In addition, the trade-off between routing overhead and power consumption can also be controlled by the proposed scan-cell reordering techniques. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of each of the proposed techniques individually."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13202","fieldValue":"DFT"}
