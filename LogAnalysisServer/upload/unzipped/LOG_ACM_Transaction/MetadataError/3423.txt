The current state-of-the-art protocols (Deluge and MNP) for network reprogramming perform the code dissemination in a multihop manner using a three-way handshake where metadata is exchanged prior to code exchange to suppress redundant transmissions. The code image is also pipelined through the network at the granularity of pages. In this article we propose a protocol called Freshet for optimizing the energy for code upload and speeding up the dissemination if multiple sources of code are available. The energy optimization is achieved by equipping each node with limited nonlocal topology information which it uses to determine the time when it can go to sleep since code is not being distributed in its vicinity. The protocol to handle multiple sources provides a loose coupling of nodes to a source and disseminates code in waves each originating at a source with a mechanism to handle collisions when the waves meet. The protocol's performance with respect to reliability, delay, and energy consumed is demonstrated through analysis, simulation, and implementation on the Berkeley mote platform."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21228","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21228","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21229","fieldValue":" In sensor network localization, multihop based approaches have been proposed to approximate the shortest paths to Euclidean distances between pairwise sensors. A good approximation can be achieved when sensors are densely deployed in a convex area, where the shortest paths are close to straight lines connecting pairwise sensors. However, in a concave network, the shortest paths may deviate far away from straight lines, which leads to erroneous distance estimation and inaccurate localization results. To solve this problem, we propose an improved multihop algorithm that can recognize and filter out the erroneous distance estimation, and therefore achieve accurate localization results even in a concave network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21230","fieldValue":" In this article, we design techniques that exploit data correlations in sensor data to minimize communication costs (and hence, energy costs) incurred during data gathering in a sensor network. Our proposed approach is to select a small subset of sensor nodes that may be sufficient to reconstruct data for the entire sensor network. Then, during data gathering only the selected sensors need to be involved in communication. The selected set of sensors must also be connected, since they need to relay data to the data-gathering node. We define the problem of selecting such a set of sensors as the connected correlation-dominating set problem, and formulate it in terms of an appropriately defined correlation structure that captures general data correlations in a sensor network. We develop a set of energy-efficient distributed algorithms and competitive centralized heuristics to select a connected correlation-dominating set of small size. The designed distributed algorithms can be implemented in an asynchronous communication model, and can tolerate message losses. We also design an exponential (but nonexhaustive) centralized approximation algorithm that returns a solution within O(log n) of the optimal size. Based on the approximation algorithm, we design a class of centralized heuristics that are empirically shown to return near-optimal solutions. Simulation results over randomly generated sensor networks with both artificially and naturally generated data sets demonstrate the efficiency of the designed algorithms and the viability of our techniqueâ\u20AC\u201Deven in dynamic conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21230","fieldValue":"ACM"}
