The original BFA requires 480,000 fault injections to recover a 128-bit AES key. This work attempts to reduce the number of fault injections under the same attack assumptions. We analyze BFA from an information theoretical perspective and introduce a new probability-based distinguisher. Three approaches are proposed for different attack scenarios. The best one realized a 66.8% reduction of the number of fault injections on AES."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7085","fieldValue":"AES"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7085","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7085","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7086","fieldValue":"Mozaffari-Kermani, Mehran"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7086","fieldValue":" Symmetric-key cryptography can resist the potential post-quantum attacks expected with the not-so-faraway advent of quantum computing power.

In this article, we propose, assess, and benchmark reliable constructions for stateless hash-based signatures. Such architectures are believed to be one of the prominent post-quantum schemes, offering security proofs relative to plausible properties of the hash function; however, it is well known that their confidentiality does not guarantee reliable architectures in the presence natural and malicious faults. We propose and benchmark fault diagnosis methods for this post-quantum cryptography variant through case studies for hash functions and present the simulations and implementations results (through application-specific integrated circuit evaluations) to show the applicability of the presented schemes. The proposed approaches make such hash-based constructions more reliable against natural faults and help protecting them against malicious faults and can be tailored based on the resources available and for different reliability objectives."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7086","fieldValue":"Fault Detection Architectures for Post-Quantum Cryptographic Stateless Hash-Based Secure Signatures Benchmarked on ASIC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7086","fieldValue":"ACM"}
