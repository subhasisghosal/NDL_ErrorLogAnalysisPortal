Our performance metric is the total utility achieved by jointly optimizing transmission rates using congestion control and paths using source routing. In general, this performance difference is strictly positive and hard to determine--in fact an NP-hard problem. To better estimate this performance gap, we develop analytical bounds to this \"cost of not splitting\" in routing. We prove that the number of paths needed for optimal multipath routing differs from that of optimal single-path routing by no more than the number of links in the network. We provide a general bound on the performance loss, which is independent of the number of source-destination pairs when the latter is larger than the number of links in a network. We also propose a vertex projection method and combine it with a greedy branch-and-bound algorithm to provide progressively tighter bounds on the performance loss. Numerical examples are used to show the effectiveness of our approximation technique and estimation algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10252","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10253","fieldValue":" Recently, there has been a great deal of research on using mobility in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to facilitate surveillance and reconnaissance in a wide deployment area. Besides providing an extended sensing coverage, node mobility along with spatial correlation introduces new network dynamics, which could lead to the traffic patterns fundamentally different from the traditional (Markovian) models. In this paper, a novel traffic modeling scheme for capturing these dynamics is proposed that takes into account the statistical patterns of node mobility and spatial correlation. The contributions made in this paper are twofold. First, it is shown that the joint effects of mobility and spatial correlation can lead to bursty traffic. More specifically, a high mobility variance and small spatial correlation can give rise to pseudo-long-range-dependent (LRD) traffic (high bursty traffic), whose autocorrelation function decays slowly and hyperbolically up to a certain cutoff time lag. Second, due to the ad hoc nature of WSNs, certain relay nodes may have several routes passing through them, necessitating local traffic aggregations. At these relay nodes, our model predicts that the aggregated traffic also exhibits the bursty behavior characterized by a scaled power-law decayed autocovariance function. According to these findings, a novel traffic shaping protocol using movement coordination is proposed to facilitate effective and efficient resource provisioning strategy. Finally, simulation results reveal a close agreement between the traffic pattern predicted by our theoretical model and the simulated transmissions from multiple independent sources, under specific bounds of the observation intervals."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10253","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8403","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10254","fieldValue":" In this paper, we investigate the static multicast advance reservation (MCAR) problem for all-optical wavelength-routed WDM networks. Under the advanced reservation traffic model, connection requests specify their start time to be some time in the future and also specify their holding times. We investigate the static MCAR problem where the set of advance reservation requests is known ahead of time. We prove the MCAR problem is NP-complete, formulate the problem mathematically as an integer linear program (ILP), and develop three efficient heuristics, seqRWA, ISH, and SA, to solve the problem for practical size networks. We also introduce a theoretical lower bound on the number of wavelengths required. To evaluate our heuristics, we first compare their performances to the ILP for small networks, and then simulate them over real-world, large-scale networks. We find the SA heuristic provides close to optimal results compared to the ILP for our smaller networks, and up to a 33% improvement over seqRWA and up to a 22% improvement over ISH on realistic networks. SA provides, on average, solutions 1.5-1.8 times the cost given by our conservative lower bound on large networks."}
