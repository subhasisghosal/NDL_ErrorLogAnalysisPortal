However, in practical complex environments, the interactions between agents can be sparse, and each agent's interacting partners may change frequently and randomly. To this end, we investigate the multiagent coordination problems in cooperative environments under a social learning framework. We consider a large population of agents where each agent interacts with another agent randomly chosen from the population in each round. Each agent learns its policy through repeated interactions with the rest of the agents via social learning. It is not clear a priori if all agents can learn a consistent optimal coordination policy in such a situation. We distinguish two different types of learners depending on the amount of information each agent can perceive: individual action learner and joint action learner. The learning performance of both types of learners is evaluated under a number of challenging deterministic and stochastic cooperative games, and the influence of the information sharing degree on the learning performance also is investigatedâ\u20AC\u201Da key difference from the learning framework involving repeated interactions among fixed agents."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3958","fieldValue":" Previous research demonstrates that discourse relations can help generate high-quality summaries. Existing studies usually adopt existing discourse parsers directly with no modifications, hence cannot take full advantage of discourse parsing. This paper describes a new single document summarization system. In contrast to previous work, we train a discourse parser specially for summarization by using summaries. The training data are dynamically changed during the training phase to enable the parser to grab the text units that are important for summaries. A special tree-based summary extraction algorithm is designed to work with the new parser. The proposed system enables us to combine discourse parsing and summarization in a unified scheme. Experiments on both the RST-DT and Dìˆ\u20AC1 datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3959","fieldValue":" In recent years, computational engineering has undergone great changes due to the development of the graphics processing unit (GPU) technology. For example, in room acoustics, the wave-based methods, that formerly were considered too expensive for 3-D impulse response simulations, are now chosen to exploit the parallel nature of GPU devices considerably reducing the execution time of the simulations. There exist contributions related to this topic that have explored the performance of different GPU algorithms; however, the computational analysis of a general explicit model that incorporates algorithms with different neighboring orders and a general frequency dependent impedance boundary model has not been properly developed. In this paper, we present a GPU implementation of a complete room acoustic model based on a family of explicit finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithms. We first develop a strategy for implementing a frequency independent (FI) impedance model which is free from thread divergences and then, we extend the model adding a digital impedance filter (DIF) boundary subroutine able to compute the acoustic pressure of different nodes such as corners or edges without an additional performance penalty. Both implementations are validated and deeply analyzed by performing different 3-D numerical experiments. Finally, we define a performance metric which is able to objectively measure the computing throughput of a FDTD implementation using a simple number. The robustness of this metric allows us to compare algorithms even if these have been run in different GPU cards or have been formulated with other explicit models."}
