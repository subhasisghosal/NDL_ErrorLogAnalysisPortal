The timed input\/output automata (TIOA) framework and the UPPAAL software package are two widely used modeling and verification tools for this purpose. To this end, we develop the algorithm TUConvert for converting distributed TIOA models to UPPAAL behavioral models and formally prove its correctness. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm by the formal verification of a distributed real-time industrial communication protocol that is modeled by TIOA."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/7069","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: &#199;ankaya University, Etimesgut\/Ankara, Turkey (Schmidt, Klaus Werner); Middle East Technical University, &#199;ankaya\/Ankara, Turkey (Kartal, Yusuf Bora; Schmidt, Ece Gran)"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7069","fieldValue":"UPPAAL"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7069","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7069","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1646","fieldValue":" As silicon technologies move into the nanometer regime, transistor reliability is expected to wane as devices become subject to extreme process variation, particle-induced transient errors, and transistor wear-out. Unless these challenges are addressed, computer vendors can expect low yields and short mean-times-to-failure. In this article, we examine the challenges of designing complex computing systems in the presence of transient and permanent faults. We select one small aspect of a typical chip multiprocessor (CMP) system to study in detail, a single CMP router switch. Our goal is to design a BulletProof CMP switch architecture capable of tolerating significant levels of various types of defects. We first assess the vulnerability of the CMP switch to transient faults. To better understand the impact of these faults, we evaluate our CMP switch designs using circuit-level timing on detailed physical layouts. Our infrastructure represents a new level of fidelity in architectural-level fault analysis, as we can accurately track faults as they occur, noting whether they manifest or not, because of masking in the circuits, logic, or architecture. Our experimental results are quite illuminating. We find that transient faults, because of their fleeting nature, are of little concern for our CMP switch, even within large switch fabrics with fast clocks. Next, we develop a unified model of permanent faults, based on the time-tested bathtub curve. Using this convenient abstraction, we analyze the reliability versus area tradeoff across a wide spectrum of CMP switch designs, ranging from unprotected designs to fully protected designs with on-line repair and recovery capabilities. Protection is considered at multiple levels from the entire system down through arbitrary partitions of the design. We find that designs are attainable that can tolerate a larger number of defects with less overhead than na√Øve triple-modular redundancy, using domain-specific techniques, such as end-to-end error detection, resource sparing, automatic circuit decomposition, and iterative diagnosis and reconfiguration."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1646","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1646","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7070","fieldValue":" We consider a battery-less real-time embedded system equipped with an energy harvester. It scavenges energy from an environmental resource according to some stochastic patterns. The success of jobs is threatened in the case of energy shortage, which might be due to lack of harvested energy, losses originated from the super-capacitor self-discharge, as well as power consumption of executed tasks. The periodic real-time tasks of the system follow a dual-criticality model. In addition, each task has a minimum required success ratio that needs to be satisfied in steady state. We analytically evaluate the behavior of such a system in terms of its energy-related success ratio for a given schedule. Based on these results, we propose a scheduling algorithm that satisfies both temporal and success-ratio constraints of the jobs, while respecting task criticalities and corresponding system modes. The accuracy of the analytical method as well as its dependence on the numerical computations and other model assumptions are extensively discussed through comparison with simulation results. Also, the efficacy of the proposed scheduling algorithm is studied through comparison to some existing non-mixed- and mixed-criticality scheduling algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7070","fieldValue":"ACM"}
