To allow scalability, the original deformation problem can be approximately represented by a compact set of control variables. We show the direct relation between the locations of handles on the mesh and the local rigidity under deformation, and introduce the notion of handle-aware rigidity. Then, we present a reduced model whose control variables are intelligently distributed across the surface, respecting the rigidity information and the geometry. Specifically, for each handle, the control variables are the transformations of the isolines of a harmonic scalar field representing the deformation propagation from that handle. The isolines constitute a virtual skeletal structure similar to the bones in skinning deformation, thus correctly capturing the low-frequency shape deformation. To interpolate the transformations from the isolines to the original mesh, we design a method which is local, linear and geometry-dependent. This novel interpolation scheme and the transformation-based reduced domain allow each iteration of the nonlinear solver to be fully computed over the reduced domain. This makes the per-iteration cost dependent on only the number of isolines and enables compelling deformation of highly detailed shapes at interactive rates. In addition, we show how the handle-driven isolines provide an efficient means for deformation transfer without full shape correspondence."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15839","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15839","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15840","fieldValue":" Many graphics applications, including computer games and 3D animated films, make heavy use of deforming mesh sequences. In this paper, we generalize gradient domain editing to deforming mesh sequences. Our framework is keyframe based. Given sparse and irregularly distributed constraints at unevenly spaced keyframes, our solution first adjusts the meshes at the keyframes to satisfy these constraints, and then smoothly propagate the constraints and deformations at keyframes to the whole sequence to generate new deforming mesh sequence. To achieve convenient keyframe editing, we have developed an efficient alternating least-squares method. It harnesses the power of subspace deformation and two-pass linear methods to achieve high-quality deformations. We have also developed an effective algorithm to define boundary conditions for all frames using handle trajectory editing. Our deforming mesh editing framework has been successfully applied to a number of editing scenarios with increasing complexity, including footprint editing, path editing, temporal filtering, handle-based deformation mixing, and spacetime morphing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15840","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15840","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15841","fieldValue":"Van Gool, Luc"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15841","fieldValue":" This paper describes algorithms to automatically derive 3D models of high visual quality from single facade images of arbitrary resolutions.

Our system gives rise to three exciting applications: urban reconstruction based on low resolution oblique aerial imagery, reconstruction of facades based on higher resolution ground-based imagery, and the automatic derivation of shape grammar rules from facade images to build a rule base for procedural modeling technology."}
