{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3127","fieldValue":" Farsi (Persian) is a low-resource language that suffers from the data sparsity problem and a lack of efficient processing tools. Due to their broad application in natural language processing tasks, part-of-speech (POS) taggers are one of those important tools that should be considered in this respect. Despite recent work on Farsi tagging, there is still room for improvement. The best reported accuracy so far is 96&percnt;, which in special cases can rise to 96.9&percnt;. The main problem with existing taggers is their inefficiency in coping with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Addressing both problems of accuracy and OOV words, we developed a neural network-based POS tagger (NPT) that performs efficiently on Farsi. Despite using less data, NPT provides better results in comparison to state-of-the-art systems. Our proposed tagger performs with an accuracy of 97.4&percnt;, with performance highly influenced by morphological features. We carry out a shallow morphological analysis and show considerable improvement over the baseline configuration."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3127","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3127","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22291","fieldValue":" Payload attribution can be an important element in network forensics. Given a history of packet transmissions and an excerpt of a possible packet payload, a payload attribution system (PAS) makes it feasible to identify the sources, destinations, and the times of appearance on a network of all the packets that contained the specified payload excerpt. A PAS, as one of the core components in a network forensics system, enables investigating cybercrimes on the Internet by, for example, tracing the spread of worms and viruses, identifying who has received a phishing e-mail in an enterprise, or discovering which insider allowed an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. Due to the increasing volume of network traffic in today's networks, it is infeasible to effectively store and query all the actual packets for extended periods of time in order to allow analysis of network events for investigative purposes; therefore, we focus on extremely compressed digests of the packet activity. We propose several new methods for payload attribution, which utilize Rabin fingerprinting, shingling, and winnowing. Our best methods allow building practical payload attribution systems, which provide data reduction ratios greater than 100:1 while supporting efficient queries with very low false positive rates. We demonstrate the properties of the proposed methods and specifically analyze their performance and practicality when used as modules of a network forensics system ForNet. Our experimental results outperform current state-of-the-art methods both in terms of false positives and data reduction ratio. Finally, these approaches directly allow the collected data to be stored and queried by an untrusted party without disclosing any payload information nor the contents of queries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22291","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22291","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22292","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a new voting protocol with several desirable security properties. The voting stage of the protocol can be performed by humans without computers; it provides every voter with the means to verify that all the votes were counted correctly (universal verifiability) while preserving ballot secrecy. The protocol has â\u20ACœeverlasting privacyâ\u20AC?: Even a computationally unbounded adversary gains no information about specific votes from observing the protocol's output. Unlike previous protocols with these properties, this protocol distributes trust between two authorities: a single corrupt authority will not cause voter privacy to be breached. Finally, the protocol is receipt-free: A voter cannot prove how she voted even if she wants to do so. We formally prove the security of the protocol in the universal composability framework, based on number-theoretic assumptions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22293","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of authenticating a stream of packets transmitted over a network controlled by an adversary who may perform arbitrary attacks on the stream: He may drop or modify chosen packets, rearrange the order of the packets in any way, and inject new, random, or specially crafted packets into the stream.
