In particular, we analyze the network-layer performance of one such scheme, the random 1\/2 disk routing scheme, which is a localized geometric routing scheme in which each node chooses the next relay randomly among the nodes within its transmission range and in the general direction of the destination. The techniques developed in this paper enable us to establish the asymptotic connectivity and the convergence results for the mean and variance of the routing path lengths generated by geometric routing schemes in random wireless networks. In particular, we approximate the progress of the routing path toward the destination by a Markov process and determine the sufficient conditions that ensure the asymptotic connectivity for both dense and large-scale ad hoc networks deploying the random 1\/2 disk routing scheme. Furthermore, using this Markov characterization, we show that the expected length (hop count) of the path generated by the random 1\/2 disk routing scheme normalized by the length of the path generated by the ideal direct-line routing, converges to 3Ï\u20AC\/4 asymptotically. Moreover, we show that the variance-to-mean ratio of the routing path length converges $9Ï\u20AC^2$\/64-1 to asymptotically. Through simulation, we show that the aforementioned asymptotic statistics are in fact quite accurate even for finite granularity and size of the network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10715","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10715","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10715","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10716","fieldValue":" An information collection problem in a wireless network with random events is considered. Wireless devices report on each event using one of multiple reporting formats. Each format has a different quality and uses different data lengths. Delivering all data in the highest-quality format can overload system resources. The goal is to make intelligent format selection and routing decisions to maximize time-averaged information quality subject to network stability. Lyapunov optimization theory can be used to solve such a problem by repeatedly minimizing the linear terms of a quadratic drift-plus-penalty expression. To reduce delays, this paper proposes a novel extension of this technique that preserves the quadratic nature of the drift minimization while maintaining a fully separable structure. In addition, to avoid high queuing delay, paths are restricted to at most 2 hops. The resulting algorithm can push average information quality arbitrarily close to optimum, with a tradeoff in queue backlog. The algorithm compares favorably to the basic drift-plus-penalty scheme in terms of backlog and delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10716","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10716","fieldValue":"ACM"}
