The design of the specification, known as the Requirements Problem (RP), is a complex problem-solving task because it involves, for each new system, the discovery and exploration of, and decision making in a new problem space. A system is adaptive if it can detect deviations between its runtime behavior and its requirements, specifically situations where its behavior violates one or more of its requirements. Given such a deviation, an Adaptive System uses feedback mechanisms to analyze these changes and decide, with or without human intervention, how to adjust its behavior as a result. We are interested in defining the Requirements Problem for Adaptive Systems (RPAS). In our case, we are looking for a configurable specification such that whenever requirements fail to be fulfilled, the system can go through a series of adaptations that change its configuration and eventually restore fulfilment of the requirements. From a theoretical perspective, this article formally shows the fundamental differences between standard RE (notably Zave and Jackson [1997]) and RE for Adaptive Systems (see the seminal work by Fickas and Feather [1995], to Letier and van Lamsweerde [2004], and up to Whittle et al. [2010]). The main contribution of this article is to introduce the RPAS as a new RP class that is specific to Adaptive Systems. We relate the RPAS to RE research on the relaxation of requirements, the evaluation of their partial satisfaction, and the monitoring and control of requirements, all topics of particular interest in research on adaptive systems [de Lemos et al. 2013]. From an engineering perspective, we define a proto-framework for solving RPAS, which illustrates features needed in future frameworks for adaptive software systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8227","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8227","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8228","fieldValue":"Zhao, J Leon"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8228","fieldValue":" This introduction to the special issue on Business Process Intelligence (BPI) discusses the relation between data and processes. The recent attention for Big Data illustrates that organizations are aware of the potential of the torrents of data generated by today's information systems. However, at the same time, organizations are struggling to extract value from this overload of data. Clearly, there is a need for data scientists able to transform event data into actionable information. To do this, it is crucial to take a process perspective. The ultimate goal of BPI is not to improve information systems or the recording of data; instead the focus should be in improving the process. For example, we may want to aim at reducing costs, minimizing response times, and ensuring compliance. This requires a â\u20ACœconfrontationâ\u20AC? between process models and event data. Recent advances in process mining allow us to automatically learn process models showing the bottlenecks from â\u20ACœrawâ\u20AC? event data. Moreover, given a normative model, we can use conformance checking to quantify and understand deviations. Automatically learned models may also be used for prediction and recommendation. BPI is rapidly developing as a field linking data science to business process management. This article aims to provide an overview thereby paving the way for the other contributions in this special issue."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8228","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8228","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8229","fieldValue":"Wang, G Alan"}
