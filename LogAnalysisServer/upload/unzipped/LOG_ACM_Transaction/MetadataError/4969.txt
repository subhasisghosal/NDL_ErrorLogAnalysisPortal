To set up such an application, the distributed components require spontaneous composition. Since dynamics in the environment and device failures may imply the unavailability of components and devices at any time, finding, maintaining, and adapting such a composition is a nontrivial task. Moreover, the speed of such a configuration process directly influences the user since in the event of a configuration, the user has to wait. In this article, we introduce configuration algorithms for homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. We discuss a comprehensive approach to pervasive application configuration that adapts to the characteristics of the environment: It chooses the most efficient configuration method for the given environment to minimize the configuration latency. Moreover, we propose a new scheme for caching and reusing partial application configurations. This scheme reduces the configuration latency even further such that a configuration can be executed without notable disturbance of the user."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1272","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1272","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3610","fieldValue":" In this paper, a method for automatic reduction of dissonance in recorded isolated chords is proposed. Previous approaches address this problem using source separation and note-level processing. In our approach, we manipulate the harmonic structure as a whole in order to avoid beating partials which, according to prior research on dissonance perception, typically produce an unpleasant sound. The proposed system firstly performs a sinusoidal plus residual modeling of the input and analyses the various fundamental frequencies present in the chord. This information is used to create a symbolic representation of the in-tune version of the input according to some musical rules. Then, the partials of the signals are shifted in order to fit the in-tune harmonic structure of the input chord. The input is assumed to contain one isolated chord, with relatively stable fundamental frequencies belonging to the Western chromatic scale. The evaluation has been performed by 31 expert musicians, which have quantified the perceived consonance of six varied, out-of-tune chords in three variants: unprocessed, processed with our system and processed by a state-of-the-art commercial tool (Melodyne Editor). The proposed approach attains an important reduction of the perceived dissonance, showing better performance than Melodyne Editor for most of the cases evaluated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3610","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3610","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3611","fieldValue":"Lun, Daniel P K"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3611","fieldValue":"Tak-Wai Shen"}
