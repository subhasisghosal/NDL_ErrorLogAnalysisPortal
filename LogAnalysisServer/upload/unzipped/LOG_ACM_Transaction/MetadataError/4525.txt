{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24696","fieldValue":" The generalized feed back shift register (GFSR) algorithm suggested by Lewis and Payne is a widely used pseudorandom number generator, but has the following serious drawbacks: (1) an initialization scheme to assure higher order equidistribution is involved and is time consuming; (2) each bit of the generated words constitutes an m-sequence based on a primitive trinomials, which shows poor randomness with respect to weight distribution; (3) a large working area is necessary; (4) the period of sequence is far shorter than the theoretical upper bound. This paper presents the twisted GFSR (TGFSR) algorithm, a slightly but essentially modified version of the GFSR, which solves all the above problems without loss of merit. Some practical TGFSR generators were implemented and passed strict empirical tests. These new generators are most suitable for simulation of a large distributive system, which requires a number of mutually independent pseudorandom number generators with compact size."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/24696","fieldValue":"<italic>m<\/italic>-sequences"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24696","fieldValue":"<italic>m<\/italic>-sequences"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/24696","fieldValue":"GF(2<italic><supscrpt>m\/italic><\/supscrpt>)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24697","fieldValue":" Low-discrepancy sequences are used for numerical integration, in simulation, and in related applications.

The basic idea was inspired by swarms of fireflies, whose flashing dynamics shows an emergent behavior. This article introduces such a synchronization technique whose main components are â\u20ACœinhibitory couplingâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœself-adjustment.â\u20AC? Based on this new technique, a number of contributions are made. First, we prove that inhibitory coupling can lead to perfect synchrony independent of initial conditions for delay-free environments and homogeneous oscillators. Second, relaxing the assumptions to systems with delays and different phase rates, we prove that such systems synchronize up to a certain precision bound. We derive this bound assuming inhomogeneous delays and show by simulations that it gives a good estimate in strongly-coupled systems. Third, we show that inhibitory coupling with self-adjustment quickly leads to synchrony with a precision comparable to that of excitatory coupling. Fourth, we analyze the robustness against faulty members performing incorrect coupling. While the specific precision-loss encountered by such disturbances depends on system parameters, the system always regains synchrony for the investigated scenarios."}
