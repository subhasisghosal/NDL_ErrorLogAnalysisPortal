We cast rays to sample visibility interactions and use the information carried by a ray for all view cells it intersects. The main contribution of the paper is a set of adaptive sampling strategies based on ray mutations that exploit the spatial coherence of visibility. Our method achieves more than an order of magnitude speedup compared to per-view cell sampling. This provides a practical solution to visibility preprocessing and also enables a new type of interactive visibility analysis application, where it is possible to quickly inspect and modify a coarse global visibility solution that is constantly refined."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16133","fieldValue":" We show that motion blur in successive video frames is invertible even if the point-spread function (PSF) due to motion smear in a single photo is non-invertible. Blurred photos exhibit nulls (zeros) in the frequency transform of the PSF, leading to an ill-posed deconvolution. Hardware solutions to avoid this require specialized devices such as the coded exposure camera or accelerating sensor motion. We employ ordinary video cameras and introduce the notion of null-filling along with joint-invertibility of multiple blur-functions. The key idea is to record the same object with varying PSFs, so that the nulls in the frequency component of one frame can be filled by other frames. The combined frequency transform becomes null-free, making deblurring well-posed. We achieve jointly-invertible blur simply by changing the exposure time of successive frames. We address the problem of automatic deblurring of objects moving with constant velocity by solving the four critical components: preservation of all spatial frequencies, segmentation of moving parts, motion estimation of moving parts, and non-degradation of the static parts of the scene. We demonstrate several challenging cases of object motion blur including textured backgrounds and partial occluders."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16133","fieldValue":"PSF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16133","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16133","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2529","fieldValue":" We propose and study a new class of online problems, which we call online tracking. Suppose an observer, say Alice, observes a multivalued function f: $Z^+ &rightarrow; Zd$ over time in an online fashion, that is, she only sees f(t) for $tâ\u2030¤t_now where tnow$ is the current time. She would like to keep a tracker, say Bob, informed of the current value of f at all times. Under this setting, Alice could send new values of f to Bob from time to time, so that the current value of f is always within a distance of Î\u201D to the last value received by Bob. We give competitive online algorithms whose communication costs are compared with the optimal offline algorithm that knows the entire f in advance. We also consider variations of the problem where Alice is allowed to send predictions to Bob, to further reduce communication for well-behaved functions. These online tracking problems have a variety of application, ranging from sensor monitoring, location-based services, to publish\/subscribe systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2529","fieldValue":"ACM"}
