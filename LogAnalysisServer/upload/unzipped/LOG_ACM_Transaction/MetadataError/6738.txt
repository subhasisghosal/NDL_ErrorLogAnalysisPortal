Despite their advantages, programmability concerns and the lack of efficient design tools\/compilers for FPGAs are preventing the technology's widespread adoption. The traditional compiler technology is microprocessor-based-systems-specific and needs to be customized and augmented to address the needs in reconfigurable computing. The challenges are several due to the resources and performance constraints for FPGAs being drastically different than those of microprocessors, and also that compiling for FPGAs requires laying the computation in space by a circuit rather than in time by a sequence of instructions. ROCCC is an optimizing C-to-VHDL compiler specifically targeting the reconfigurable computer platforms. ROCCC includes several high-level optimizations that parallelize and optimize the source code for minimized area and critical path length and maximized throughput. This article presents the effect of ROCCC's high-level transformations on the performance of the generated VHDL output. ROCCC utilizes: (1) several array access optimizations to eliminate redundant memory accesses, (2) procedure-level optimizations to achieve circuit area reductions of up to 88&percnt; compared to circuit areas generated from unoptimized codes, (3) loop-level optimizations to increase the throughput, and (4) transformations unique to certain classes of applications. The preceding listed features help ROCCC generate circuits with very large degrees of parallelism capable of very high computation rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1721","fieldValue":"ROCCC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1721","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1721","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7979","fieldValue":" Feature selection is widely used in preparing high-dimensional data for effective data mining. The explosive popularity of social media produces massive and high-dimensional data at an unprecedented rate, presenting new challenges to feature selection. Social media data consists of (1) traditional high-dimensional, attribute-value data such as posts, tweets, comments, and images, and (2) linked data that provides social context for posts and describes the relationships between social media users as well as who generates the posts, and so on. The nature of social media also determines that its data is massive, noisy, and incomplete, which exacerbates the already challenging problem of feature selection. In this article, we study a novel feature selection problem of selecting features for social media data with its social context. In detail, we illustrate the differences between attribute-value data and social media data, investigate if linked data can be exploited in a new feature selection framework by taking advantage of social science theories. We design and conduct experiments on datasets from real-world social media Web sites, and the empirical results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of feature selection. Further experiments are conducted to evaluate the effects of user--user and user--post relationships manifested in linked data on feature selection, and research issues for future work will be discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7979","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7979","fieldValue":"ACM"}
