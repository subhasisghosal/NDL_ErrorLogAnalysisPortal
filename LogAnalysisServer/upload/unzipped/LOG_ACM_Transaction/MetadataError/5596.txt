Common method of its detection is histopathological tissue analysis, which, though leads to vital diagnosis, is significantly correlated to the tiredness, experience, and workload of the pathologist. Researchers have been working since decades to get rid of manual inspection, and to develop trustworthy systems for detecting colon cancer. Several techniques, based on spectral\/spatial analysis of colon biopsy images, and serum and gene analysis of colon samples, have been proposed in this regard. Due to rapid evolution of colon cancer detection techniques, a latest review of recent research in this field is highly desirable. The aim of this paper is to discuss various colon cancer detection techniques. In this survey, we categorize the techniques on the basis of the adopted methodology and underlying data set, and provide detailed description of techniques in each category. Additionally, this study provides an extensive comparison of various colon cancer detection categories, and of multiple techniques within each category. Further, most of the techniques have been evaluated on similar data set to provide a fair performance comparison. Analysis reveals that neither of the techniques is perfect; however, research community is progressively inching toward the finest possible solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4924","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4924","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4924","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4925","fieldValue":" Better understanding of structural class of a given protein reveals important information about its overall folding type and its domain. It can also be directly used to provide critical information on general tertiary structure of a protein which has a profound impact on protein function determination and drug design. Despite tremendous enhancements made by pattern recognition-based approaches to solve this problem, it still remains as an unsolved issue for bioinformatics that demands more attention and exploration. In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction model that incorporates physicochemical and evolutionary-based information simultaneously. We also propose overlapped segmented distribution and autocorrelation-based feature extraction methods to provide more local and global discriminatory information. The proposed feature extraction methods are explored for 15 most promising attributes that are selected from a wide range of physicochemical-based attributes. Finally, by applying an ensemble of different classifiers namely, Adaboost.M1, LogitBoost, naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM) we show enhancement of the protein structural class prediction accuracy for four popular benchmarks."}
