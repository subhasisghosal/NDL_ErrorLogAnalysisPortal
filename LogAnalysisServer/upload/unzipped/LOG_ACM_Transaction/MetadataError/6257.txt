In this paper, we study the feasibility of achieving energy efficiency in reconfigurable computing systems (e.g., FPGAs) through runtime partial reconfiguration (PR) techniques. In the ideal scenario, we use a hardware accelerator to accelerate certain parts of the program execution; when the accelerator is not active, we use partial reconfiguration to unload it to reduce power consumption. Since the reconfiguration process may introduce a high energy overhead, it is unclear whether this approach is efficient. To approach this problem, we first analytically identify the conditions under which partial reconfiguration can reduce energy consumption. Our results indicate that the key to reduce partial reconfiguration energy overhead is to minimize the time overhead of the reconfiguration process. Based on this analysis, we design and implement a fast reconfiguration engine that achieves close-to-ideal throughput on Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGAs. Our fast reconfiguration engine utilizes a master-slave DMA pair to stream data between the SRAM and the Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP). We experimentally verify our proposed solutions and compare our design to existing energy reduction techniques, such as clock gating. The results of our study show that by using partial reconfiguration to eliminate the power consumption of the accelerator when it is inactive, we can accelerate program execution and at the same time reduce the overall energy consumption by half."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/6668","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442116.2442122\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6669","fieldValue":" Recent studies have demonstrated that it is feasible to perform public key cryptographic operations on resource-constrained sensor platforms. However, the significant energy consumption introduced by public key operations makes any public key-based protocol an easy target of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. For example, if digital signature schemes such as ECDSA are used directly for broadcast authentication without further protection, an attacker can simply broadcast fake messages and force the receiving nodes to perform a huge number of unnecessary signature verifications, eventually exhausting their battery power. This paper shows how to mitigate such DoS attacks when digital signatures are used for broadcast authentication in sensor networks. Specifically, this paper first presents two filtering techniques, the group-based filter and the key chain-based filter, to handle the DoS attacks against signature verification. Both methods can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary signature verifications when a sensor node is under DoS attacks. This paper then combines these two filters and proposes a hybrid solution to further improve the performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/6669","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442116.2442123\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6669","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6669","fieldValue":"ACM"}
