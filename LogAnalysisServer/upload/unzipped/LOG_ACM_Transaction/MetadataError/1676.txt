Cutaway renderings address this problem by omitting portions of secondary objects so as to expose the objects of interest. This paper introduces a method for generating cutaway renderings of polygonal scenes at interactive frame rates, using illustrative and non-photorealistic rendering cues to expose objects of interest in the context of surrounding objects. We describe a method for creating a view-dependent cutaway shape along with modifications to the polygonal rendering pipeline to create cutaway renderings. Applications for this technique include architectural modeling, path planning, and computer games."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16022","fieldValue":"NPR"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16022","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16022","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16023","fieldValue":"Pang, Wai-Man"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16023","fieldValue":"Wong, Tien-Tsin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16023","fieldValue":"Heng, Pheng-Ann"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16023","fieldValue":" Due to the tediousness and labor intensive cost, some manga artists have already employed computer-assisted methods for converting color photographs to manga backgrounds. However, existing bitonal image generation methods usually produce unsatisfactory uniform screening results that are not consistent with traditional mangas, in which the artist employs a rich set of screens. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating bitonal manga backgrounds from color photographs. Our goal is to preserve the visual richness in the original photograph by utilizing not only screen density, but also the variety of screen patterns. To achieve the goal, we select screens for different regions in order to preserve the tone similarity, texture similarity, and chromaticity distinguishability. The multi-dimensional scaling technique is employed in such a color-to-pattern matching for maintaining pattern dissimilarity of the screens. Users can control the mapping by a few parameters and interactively fine-tune the result. Several results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and convenience of the proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16023","fieldValue":"ACM"}
