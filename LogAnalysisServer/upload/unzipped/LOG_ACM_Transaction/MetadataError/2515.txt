In the resulting procedure, the expected number of uniformly distributed random numbers is less than in the alias method (practically 1). A refinement gives a version where in limit just one uniformly distributed number is required at the expense of some storage space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18507","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18507","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18508","fieldValue":" A symbolic node-addition model for matrix factorization of symmetric positive definite matrices is described. In this model, the nodes are added onto the filled graph one at a time. The advantage of the node-addition model is its simplicity and flexibility. The model can be immediately incorporated into finite element analysis programs. The model can also be extended to determine modification patterns in the matrix factors due to changes in the original matrix. For a given matrix K(=LDLt), the time complexity of the algorithm for constructing the structure of the lower triangular matrix factor L is O(&eegr;(L)) where &eegr;(L) is the number of nonzero entries in L."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18508","fieldValue":"ACM"}
