{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21394","fieldValue":" Radio link quality estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has a fundamental impact on the network performance and also affects the design of higher-layer protocols. Therefore, for about a decade, it has been attracting a vast array of research works. Reported works on link quality estimation are typically based on different assumptions, consider different scenarios, and provide radically different (and sometimes contradictory) results. This article provides a comprehensive survey on related literature, covering the characteristics of low-power links, the fundamental concepts of link quality estimation in WSNs, a taxonomy of existing link quality estimators, and their performance analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey tackling in detail link quality estimation in WSNs. We believe our efforts will serve as a reference to orient researchers and system designers in this area."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21394","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21394","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21395","fieldValue":"Kumar, P Vijay"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21395","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks can often be viewed in terms of a uniform deployment of a large number of nodes in a region of Euclidean space. Following deployment, the nodes self-organize into a mesh topology with a key aspect being self-localization. Having obtained a mesh topology in a dense, homogeneous deployment, a frequently used approximation is to take the hop distance between nodes to be proportional to the Euclidean distance between them. In this work, we analyze this approximation through two complementary analyses. We assume that the mesh topology is a random geometric graph on the nodes; and that some nodes are designated as anchors with known locations. First, we obtain high probability bounds on the Euclidean distances of all nodes that are h hops away from a fixed anchor node. In the second analysis, we provide a heuristic argument that leads to a direct approximation for the density function of the Euclidean distance between two nodes that are separated by a hop distance h. This approximation is shown, through simulation, to very closely match the true density function. Localization algorithms that draw upon the preceding analyses are then proposed and shown to perform better than some of the well-known algorithms present in the literature. Belief-propagation-based message-passing is then used to further enhance the performance of the proposed localization algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first usage of message-passing for hop-count-based self-localization."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21395","fieldValue":"Theory and algorithms for hop-count-based localization with random geometric graph models of dense sensor networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21396","fieldValue":" In wireless sensor networks, different applications feature different requirements in terms of such performance metrics as sensing coverage and data reporting latency. In most applications, it is usually sufficient to provide a Desired Sensing Coverage (DSC) lower than full coverage at any instance with the guarantee that the whole area will eventually be covered within a specified delay bound. Due to the fact that these applications are also expected to run for longer periods of time and at the same time battery recharging and replacement are costly, energy consumption in wireless sensor networks should be minimized while achieving the application goals. In this article, we propose a novel framework for application-specific data gathering which exploits a trade-off between coverage and latency, thereby minimizing energy consumption and extending the network lifetime. The proposed energy-efficient, constant-time, randomized scheme, called Coverage-Adaptive raNdom SEnsor sElection (CANSEE), selects a subset of k sensors to report at each round so as to fulfill the application-specific requirement of desired sensing coverage and bounded latency, instead of always guaranteeing full coverage and minimum latency. We present a probabilistic model to estimate: (i) the connectivity of those selected k sensors and the number of additional sensors needed to guarantee connectivity; (ii) a lower bound on k in each round; and (iii) the probability of almost surely having k data reporters using the Chernoff bound. The immediate event detection capability achieved by the proposed CANSEE scheme is also analyzed to compare the performance of our framework with other data gathering schemes that allow 100&percnt; coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework leads to a significant conservation of energy (and thus extended network lifetime) with a small trade-off between coverage and data reporting latency, yet providing the required data reporting capability."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21396","fieldValue":"A novel framework for energy-efficient data gathering with random coverage in wireless sensor networks"}
