Australia, like most of the western world, is bracing up for the looming ageing population crisis, spiraling healthcare costs, and expected serious shortage of healthcare workers. Assistive service and companion (social) robots are being seen as one of the ways for supporting aged care facilities to meet this challenge and improve the quality of care of older people including mental and physical health outcomes, as well as to support healthcare workers in personalizing care. In this article, the authors report on the design and implementation of first-ever field trials of Matilda, a human-like assistive communication (service and companion) robot for improving the emotional well-being of older people in three residential care facilities in Australia involving 70 participants. The research makes several unique contributions including Matildaâ\u20AC™s ability to break technology barriers, positively engage older people in group and one-to-one activities, making these older people productive and useful, helping them become resilient and cope better through personalization of care, and finally providing them sensory enrichment through Matildaâ\u20AC™s multimodal communication capabilities."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8199","fieldValue":"Embodying Care in Matilda: An Affective Communication Robot for Emotional Wellbeing of Older People in Australian Residential Care Facilities"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8199","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8199","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8200","fieldValue":" We discuss our approach to developing a novel modality for the computer-delivery of Brief Motivational Interventions (BMIs) for behavior change in the form of a personalized On-Demand VIrtual Counselor (ODVIC), accessed over the internet. ODVIC is a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) that empathically delivers an evidence-based behavior change intervention by adapting, in real-time, its verbal and nonverbal communication messages to those of the userâ\u20AC™s during their interaction. We currently focus our work on excessive alcohol consumption as a target behavior, and our approach is adaptable to other target behaviors (e.g., overeating, lack of exercise, narcotic drug use, non-adherence to treatment). We based our current approach on a successful existing patient-centered brief motivational intervention for behavior change---the Drinkerâ\u20AC™s Check-Up (DCU)---whose computer-delivery with a text-only interface has been found effective in reducing alcohol consumption in problem drinkers. We discuss the results of usersâ\u20AC™ evaluation of the computer-based DCU intervention delivered with a text-only interface compared to the same intervention delivered with two different ECAs (a neutral one and one with some empathic abilities). Users rate the three systems in terms of acceptance, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the system, among other dimensions. We conclude with a discussion of how our positive results encourage our long-term goals of on-demand conversations, anytime, anywhere, with virtual agents as personal health and well-being helpers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8200","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8200","fieldValue":"ACM"}
