In UPC, automatic service composition requires dealing with four major research issues: service matching and selection, coordination and management, scalability and fault tolerance, and adaptiveness to usersâ\u20AC™ contexts and network conditions. The articles in this special issue cover some of these topics and constitute a representative sample of the latest developments in adaptive service discovery and composition in UPC."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/1195","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"1921641.1921642\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1195","fieldValue":"ACM"}
