However, Lévy mobility known to closely capture human movement patterns has not been adopted in such work. Understanding the delay-capacity tradeoff for a network with Lévy mobility can provide important insights into understanding the performance of real mobile networks governed by human mobility. This paper analytically derives an important point in the delay-capacity tradeoff for Lévy mobility, known as the critical delay. The critical delay is the minimum delay required to achieve greater throughput than what conventional static networks can possibly achieve (i.e., O(1\/√n) per node in a network with n nodes). The Lévy mobility includes Lévy flight and Lévy walk whose step-size distributions parametrized by α ∈ (0,2) are both heavy-tailed while their times taken for the same step size are different. Our proposed technique involves: 1) analyzing the joint spatio-temporal probability density function of a time-varying location of a node for Lévy flight, and 2) characterizing an embedded Markov process in Lévy walk, which is a semi-Markov process. The results indicate that in Lévy walk, there is a phase transition such that for α ∈ (0,1), the critical delay is always Θ $(n^1\/2), and for α ∈ [1,2] it is Θ (nα\/2). In contrast, Lévy flight has the critical delay Θ (nα\/2$) for α ∈ (0,2)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10521","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/10521","fieldValue":"L&#233;vy mobility"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10522","fieldValue":" Recently, it has been shown that a simple, distributed backlog-based carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) algorithm is throughput-optimal. However, throughput optimality is established under the perfect or ideal carrier-sensing assumption, i.e., each link can precisely sense the presence of other active links in its neighborhood. In this paper, we investigate the achievable throughput of the CSMA algorithm under imperfect carrier sensing. Through the analysis on both false positive and negative carrier sensing failures, we show that CSMA can achieve an arbitrary fraction of the capacity region if certain access probabilities are set appropriately. To establish this result, we use the perturbation theory of Markov chains."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10522","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10522","fieldValue":"ACM"}
