User similarity is traditionally calculated by cosine similarity or the Pearson correlation coefficient. However, both of these measures consider only the direction of rating vectors, and suffer from a range of drawbacks. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel Bayesian similarity measure based on the Dirichlet distribution, taking into consideration both the direction and length of rating vectors. We posit that not all the rating pairs should be equally counted in order to accurately model user correlation. Three different evidence factors are designed to compute the weights of rating pairs. Further, our principled method reduces correlation due to chance and potential system bias. Experimental results on six real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior accuracy in comparison with counterparts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23335","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23335","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23336","fieldValue":" Watermarking protocols are used in conjunction with digital watermarking techniques to protect digital copyright on the Internet. They define the schemes of the web transactions by which buyers can purchase protected digital content distributed by content providers in a secure manner. Over the last few years, significant examples of watermarking protocols have been proposed in literature. However, a detailed examination of such protocols has revealed a number of problems that have to be addressed in order to make them suited for current web context. Therefore, based on the most relevant problems derived from literature, this article identifies the main challenges posed by the development of watermarking protocols for web context and presents a watermarking protocol that follows a new secure, buyer-centric and mediated design approach able to meet such challenges."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23337","fieldValue":"Chiang, Yao-Yi"}
