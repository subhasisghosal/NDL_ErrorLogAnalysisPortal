The k-hotlink assignment problem denotes the task of adding at most k outgoing hotlinks to each page of a tree-like site, minimizing the path length, that is, the expected number of â\u20ACœclicksâ\u20AC? necessary for the user to reach her destination page. Another common formulation of this problem is to maximize the gain, that is, the path length reduction achieved by the assignment. In this work we analyze the natural greedy strategy, proving that it reaches the optimal gain up to the constant factor of 2. Considering the gain, we also prove the existence of a PTAS. Finally, we give a polynomial-time 2-approximation for the 1-hotlink assignment problem, which constitutes the first constant factor approximation in terms of the path length. The algorithms' performance analyses are made possible by a set of three new basic operations for the transformation of hotlink assignments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15611","fieldValue":" We propose new approaches to ray tracing that greatly reduce the required number of operations while strictly preserving the geometrical correctness of the solution. A hierarchical \"beam\" structure serves as a proxy for a collection of rays. It is tested against a kd-tree representing the overall scene in order to discard from consideration the sub-set of the kd-tree (and hence the scene) that is guaranteed not to intersect with any possible ray inside the beam. This allows for all the rays inside the beam to start traversing the tree from some node deep inside thus eliminating unnecessary operations. The original beam can be further sub-divided, and we can either continue looking for new optimal entry points for the sub-beams, or we can decompose the beam into individual rays. This is a hierarchical process that can be adapted to the geometrical complexity of a particular view direction allowing for efficient geometric anti-aliasing. By amortizing the cost of partially traversing the tree for all the rays in a beam, up to an order of magnitude performance improvement can be achieved enabling interactivity for complex scenes on ordinary desktop machines."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15611","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15611","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15612","fieldValue":" We present Energy Redistribution (ER) sampling as an unbiased method to solve correlated integral problems. ER sampling is a hybrid algorithm that uses Metropolis sampling-like mutation strategies in a standard Monte Carlo integration setting, rather than resorting to an intermediate probability distribution step. In the context of global illumination, we present Energy Redistribution Path Tracing (ERPT). Beginning with an inital set of light samples taken from a path tracer, ERPT uses path mutations to redistribute the energy of the samples over the image plane to reduce variance. The result is a global illumination algorithm that is conceptually simpler than Metropolis Light Transport (MLT) while retaining its most powerful feature, path mutation. We compare images generated with the new technique to standard path tracing and MLT."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15612","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15612","fieldValue":"ACM"}
