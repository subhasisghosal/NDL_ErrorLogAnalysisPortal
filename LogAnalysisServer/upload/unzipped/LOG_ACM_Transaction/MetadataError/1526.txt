We present a novel and efficient method, called squared distance minimization (SDM), for computing a planar B-spline curve, closed or open, to approximate a target shape defined by a point cloud, that is, a set of unorganized, possibly noisy data points. We show that SDM significantly outperforms other optimization methods used currently in common practice of curve fitting. In SDM, a B-spline curve starts from some properly specified initial shape and converges towards the target shape through iterative quadratic minimization of the fitting error. Our contribution is the introduction of a new fitting error term, called the squared distance (SD) error term, defined by a curvature-based quadratic approximant of squared distances from data points to a fitting curve. The SD error term faithfully measures the geometric distance between a fitting curve and a target shape, thus leading to faster and more stable convergence than the point distance (PD) error term, which is commonly used in computer graphics and CAGD, and the tangent distance (TD) error term, which is often adopted in the computer vision community. To provide a theoretical explanation of the superior performance of SDM, we formulate the B-spline curve fitting problem as a nonlinear least squares problem and conclude that SDM is a quasi-Newton method which employs a curvature-based positive definite approximant to the true Hessian of the objective function. Furthermore, we show that the method based on the TD error term is a Gauss-Newton iteration, which is unstable for target shapes with high curvature variations, whereas optimization based on the PD error term is the alternating method that is known to have linear convergence."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15639","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15639","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15640","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15640","fieldValue":" This article proposes a technique to animate a Chinese style painting given its image. We first extract descriptions of the brush strokes that hypothetically produced it. The key to the extraction process is the use of a brush stroke library, which is obtained by digitizing single brush strokes drawn by an experienced artist. The steps in our extraction technique are first to segment the input image, then to find the best set of brush strokes that fit the regions, and, finally, to refine these strokes to account for local appearance. We model a single brush stroke using its skeleton and contour, and we characterize texture variation within each stroke by sampling perpendicularly along its skeleton. Once these brush descriptions have been obtained, the painting can be animated at the brush stroke level. In this article, we focus on Chinese paintings with relatively sparse strokes. The animation is produced using a graphical application we developed. We present several animations of real paintings using our technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15640","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15640","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15641","fieldValue":" An extended subdivision surface (ESub) is a generalization of Catmull Clark and NURBS surfaces. Depending on the knot intervals and valences of the vertices and faces, Catmull Clark as well as NURBS patches can be generated using the extended subdivision rules. Moreover, an arbitrary choice of the knot intervals and the topology is possible. Special features like sharp edges and corners are consistently supported by setting selected knot intervals to zero or by applying special rules. Compared to the prior nonuniform rational subdivision surfaces (NURSS), the ESubs offer limit-point rules which are indispensable in many applications, for example, for computer-aided design or in adaptive visualization. The refinement and limit-point rules for our nonuniform, nonstationary scheme are obtained via a new method using local BÃ©zier control points. With our new surface, it is possible to start with existing Catmull Clark as well as NURBS models and to continue the modeling process using the extended subdivision options."}
