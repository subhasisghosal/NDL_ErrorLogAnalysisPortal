In this article, we introduce MAESTRO, a methodology for the modeling and evaluation of nonfunctional properties and embedded firmware of MPSoC architecture components at the Electronic System Level (ESL). In contrast to existing design flows that provide predefined performance models, MAESTRO defines a flexible approach that allows to define virtual prototypes that can be easily customized and extended to evaluate multiple nonfunctional properties of interest at different levels of abstraction. In MAESTRO, a design is composed purely from actor-oriented models. This enables typical ESL features such as automatic design space exploration and synthesizability of HW and SW components, typically missing in very general design flows. Unique to MAESTRO is the separation and coordination of the interaction between application functionality, firmware, and performance models for the evaluation of nonfunctional properties, and their complex interactions within a single Model-of-Computation (MoC). The main advantages of MAESTRO are: (I) Extensible modeling of interdependent nonfunctional properties of heterogeneous MPSoC components; (II) high flexibility to investigate the appropriate trade-off between modeling effort and accuracy of nonfunctional property evaluators; (III) a holistic approach for modeling application functionality as well as firmware affecting the evaluation of nonfunctional properties. Regarding (II), we present a mobile baseband processor platform use-case, executing a GSM paging application. To demonstrate (I) and (III), we present the modeling of a complex ESL processor virtual prototype, running a soft real-time application and equipped with both a power and reliability manager."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13379","fieldValue":"MAESTROâ\u20AC\u201D Holistic Actor-Oriented Modeling of Nonfunctional Properties and Firmware Behavior for MPSoCs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13380","fieldValue":" Multicore architectures with Network-on-Chips (NoCs) have been widely recognized as the de facto design for the efficient utilization of the continuously increasing density of transistors on a chip. A key challenge in designing such an NoC-based multicore processor is maintaining cache coherence in an efficient manner. Directory-based protocols avoid the bandwidth overhead of snoop-based protocols, therefore scaling to a large number of cores. However, conventional directory structures add significant indirection delay to cache-to-cache accesses in larger multicore processor. In this article we propose a novel hardware coherence technique, called integrated coherence prediction (ICP). This approach adopts a prediction technique for managing shared data to reduce or eliminate the cache-to-cache delay in coherence accesses. ICP has two unique features that differ from previous coherence prediction techniques. First, ICP introduces a new integrated prediction scheme that combines two kinds of predictors: owner predictor, which predicts the data writers and avoids the indirection through directory, and data predictor, which predicts the access address and prefetches data from remote nodes directly. Second, ICP uses a request replication method to reduce the negative effect of wrong owner prediction operations, thus facilitating overall performance improvement. We present the design and implementation details of the ICP approach. Using detailed full-system simulations, we conclude that the ICP provides a cost-effective solution for designing high-performance multicore processors."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13380","fieldValue":"Integrated Coherence Prediction: Towards Efficient Cache Coherence on NoC-Based Multicore Architectures"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13380","fieldValue":"ACM"}
