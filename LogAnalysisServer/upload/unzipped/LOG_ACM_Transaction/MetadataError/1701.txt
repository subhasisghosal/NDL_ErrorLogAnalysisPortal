Subdivision theory explains that inherently, for standard stationary subdivision algorithms, curvature-continuity and the ability to model all quadratic shapes requires a degree of at least bi-6. The existence of a simple-to-implement C2 subdivision algorithm generating surfaces of good shape and piecewise degree bi-3 in the polar setting is therefore a welcome surprise. This paper presents such an algorithm, the underlying insights, and a detailed analysis. In bi-3 C2$ polar subdivision the weights depend, as in standard schemes, only on the valence, but the valence at one central polar vertex increases to match Catmull-Clark-refinement."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/16086","fieldValue":"<i>C<\/i><sup>2<\/sup>"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16086","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16086","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16087","fieldValue":"van Wijk, Jarke J."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16087","fieldValue":" A regular map is a tiling of a closed surface into faces, bounded by edges that join pairs of vertices, such that these elements exhibit a maximal symmetry. For genus 0 and 1 (spheres and tori) it is well known how to generate and present regular maps, the Platonic solids are a familiar example. We present a method for the generation of space models of regular maps for genus 2 and higher. The method is based on a generalization of the method for tori. Shapes with the proper genus are derived from regular maps by tubification: edges are replaced by tubes. Tessellations are produced using group theory and hyperbolic geometry. The main results are a generic procedure to produce such tilings, and a collection of intriguing shapes and images. Furthermore, we show how to produce shapes of genus 2 and higher with a highly regular structure."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16087","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16087","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16088","fieldValue":" We present a method for simulating highly detailed cutting and fracturing of thin shells using low-resolution simulation meshes. Instead of refining or remeshing the underlying simulation domain to resolve complex cut paths, we adapt the extended finite element method (XFEM) and enrich our approximation by customdesigned basis functions, while keeping the simulation mesh unchanged. The enrichment functions are stored in enrichment textures, which allows for fracture and cutting discontinuities at a resolution much finer than the underlying mesh, similar to image textures for increased visual resolution. Furthermore, we propose harmonic enrichment functions to handle multiple, intersecting, arbitrarily shaped, progressive cuts per element in a simple and unified framework. Our underlying shell simulation is based on discontinuous Galerkin (DG) FEM, which relaxes the restrictive requirement of $C^1 continuous basis functions and thus allows for simpler, C0$ continuous XFEM enrichment functions."}
