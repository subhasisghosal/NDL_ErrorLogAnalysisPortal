{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5347","fieldValue":" Popular tools to evaluate classifier performance are the false positive rate FPR, true positive rate TPR, receiver operator characteristic ROC curve, and area under the curve AUC. Typically, these quantities are estimated from training data using simple resampling and counting methods, which have been shown to perform poorly when the sample size is small, as is typical in many applications. This work takes a model-based approach in classifier training and performance analysis, where we assume the true population densities are members of an uncertainty class of distributions. Given a prior over the uncertainty class and data, we form a posterior and derive optimal mean-squared-error MSE FPR and TPR estimators, as well as the sample-conditioned MSE performance of these estimators. The theory also naturally leads to optimal ROC and AUC estimators. Finally, we develop a Neyman-Pearson-based approach to optimal classifier design, which maximizes the estimated TPR for a given estimated FPR. These tools are optimal over the uncertainty class of distributions given the sample, and are available in closed form or can be easily approximated for many models. Applications are demonstrated on both synthetic and real genomic data. MATLAB code and simulations results are available in the online supplementary material."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5347","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5348","fieldValue":"Azuma, Shun-ichi"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5348","fieldValue":" Chemotaxis is the biological phenomenon in which organisms move to a more favorable location in an environment with a chemical attractant or repellent. Since chemotaxis is a typical example of the environmental response of organisms, it is a fundamental topic in biology and related fields. We discuss the performance of the internal controllers that generate chemotaxis. We first propose performance indices to evaluate the controllers. Based on these indices, we evaluate the performance of two controller models of Escherichia coli and Paramecium caudatum. As a result, it is disclosed that the E. coli-type controller achieves chemotaxis quickly but roughly, whereas the P. caudatum-type controller achieves it slowly but precisely. This result will be a biological contribution from a control theoretic point of view."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5348","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5348","fieldValue":"Performance Analysis of Chemotaxis Controllers: Which has Better Chemotaxis Controller, Escherichia coli or Paramecium caudatum?"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5348","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5348","fieldValue":"ACM"}
