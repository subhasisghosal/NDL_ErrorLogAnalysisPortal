These are different forms of dynamic power dissipation of a CMOS circuit, which is predominant compared to static power dissipation for higher switching activity. The peak power, the cycle difference power, and the peak power differential drive the transient characteristic of a CMOS circuit. In this article, we propose an ILP-based framework for the reduction of energy and transient power through datapath scheduling during behavioral synthesis. A new metric called â\u20ACœmodified cycle power functionâ\u20AC? (CPF&ast;) is defined that captures the above power characteristics and facilitates integer linear programming formulations. The ILP-based datapath scheduling schemes with CPF&ast; as objective function are developed assuming three modes of datapath operation, such as, single supply voltage and single frequency (SVSF), multiple supply voltages and dynamic frequency clocking (MVDFC), and multiple supply voltages and multicycling (MVMC). We conducted experiments on selected high-level synthesis benchmark circuits for various resource constraints and estimated power, energy and energy delay product for each of them. Experimental results show that significant reductions in power, energy and energy delay product can be obtained."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12952","fieldValue":"Wong, Martin D F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12952","fieldValue":" The increasing clock frequencies in high-end industrial circuits bring new routing challenges that cannot be handled by traditional algorithms. An important design automation problem for high-speed boards today is routing nets within tight minimum and maximum length bounds. In this article, we propose an algorithm for routing bus structures between components on two layers such that all length constraints are satisfied. This algorithm handles length extension simultaneously during the actual routing process so that maximum resource utilization is achieved during length extension. Our approach here is to process one track at a time, and choose the best subset of nets to be routed on each track. The algorithm we propose for single-track routing is guaranteed to find the optimal subset of nets together with the optimal solution with length extension on one track. The experimental comparison with a recently proposed technique shows the effectiveness of this algorithm both in terms of solution quality and run-time."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12952","fieldValue":"PCB"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12952","fieldValue":"ACM"}
