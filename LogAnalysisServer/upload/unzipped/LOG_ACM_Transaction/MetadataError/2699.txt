Our case study uses the GPCG (gradient projection, conjugate gradient) algorithm for solving bound-constrained convex quadratic problems. Our implementation of the GPCG algorithm within the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO) is available for a wide range of high-performance architectures and has been tested on problems with over 2.5 million variables. We analyze the performance as a function of the number of variables, the number of free variables, and the preconditioner. In addition, we discuss how the software design facilitates algorithmic comparisons."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19011","fieldValue":" A collection of Fortran-90 routines for evaluating the gamma function and related functions using the FM multiple-precision arithmetic package."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19011","fieldValue":"Algorithm 814: Fortran 90 software for floating-point multiple precision arithmetic, gamma and related functions"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19011","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19011","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2839","fieldValue":" The frequent occurrence of divergencesâ\u20AC\u201Dstructural differences between languages---presents a great challenge for statistical word-level alignment and machine translation.
