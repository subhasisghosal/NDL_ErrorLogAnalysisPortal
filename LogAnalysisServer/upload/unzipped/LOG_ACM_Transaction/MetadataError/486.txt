The nucleolus is known to be NP-hard to compute over compact coalitional games, that is, over games whose functions specifying the worth associated with each coalition are encoded in terms of polynomially computable functions over combinatorial structures. In particular, hardness results have been exhibited over minimum spanning tree games, threshold games, and flow games. However, due to its intricate definition involving reasoning over exponentially many coalitions, a nontrivial upper bound on its complexity was missing in the literature and looked for. This article faces this question and precisely characterizes the complexity of the nucleolus, by exhibiting an upper bound that holds on any class of compact games, and by showing that this bound is tight even on the (structurally simple) class of graph games. The upper bound is established by proposing a variant of the standard linear-programming based algorithm for nucleolus computation and by studying a framework for reasoning about succinctly specified linear programs, which are contributions of interest in their own. The hardness result is based on an elaborate combinatorial reduction, which is conceptually relevant for it provides a â\u20ACœmeasureâ\u20AC? of the computational cost to be paid for guaranteeing voluntary participation to the distribution process. In fact, the pre-nucleolus is known to be efficiently computable over graph games, with this solution concept being defined as the nucleolus but without guaranteeing that each player is granted with it at least the worth she can get alone, that is, without collaborating with the other players. Finally, this article identifies relevant tractable classes of coalitional games, based on the notion of type of a player. Indeed, in most applications where many players are involved, it is often the case that such players do belong in fact to a limited number of classes, which is known in advance and may be exploited for computing the nucleolus in a fast way."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12529","fieldValue":" This work further explores the applications of co-nondeterminism for showing kernelization lower bounds. The only known example prior to this work excludes polynomial kernelizations for the so-called Ramsey problem of finding an independent set or a clique of at least k vertices in a given graph [Kratsch 2012]. We study the more general problem of finding induced subgraphs on k vertices fulfilling some hereditary property Î , called Î -Induced Subgraph. The problem is NP-hard for all nontrivial choices of Î  by a classic result of Lewis and Yannakakis [1980]. The parameterized complexity of this problem was classified by Khot and Raman [2002] depending on the choice of Î . The interesting cases for kernelization are for Î  containing all independent sets and all cliques, since the problem is trivially polynomial time solvable or W[1]-hard otherwise. Our results are twofold. Regarding Î -Induced Subgraph, we show that for a large choice of natural graph properties Î , including chordal, perfect, cluster, and cograph, there is no polynomial kernel with respect to k. This is established by two theorems, each one capturing different (but not necessarily exclusive) sets of properties: one using a co-nondeterministic variant of OR-cross-composition and one by a polynomial parameter transformation from Ramsey. Additionally, we show how to use improvement versions of NP-hard problems as source problems for lower bounds, without requiring their NP-hardness. For example, for Î -Induced Subgraph our compositions may assume existing solutions of size k--1. This follows from the more general fact that source problems for OR-(cross-)compositions need only be NP-hard under co-nondeterministic reductions. We believe this to be useful for further lower-bound proofs, for example, since improvement versions simplify the construction of a disjunction (OR) of instances required in compositions. This adds a second way of using co-nondeterminism for lower bounds."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12530","fieldValue":" We give a general transformation that turns polynomial-size Frege proofs into subexponential-size $AC^0-Frege proofs. This indicates that proving truly exponential lower bounds for AC0$-Frege is hard, as it is a long-standing open problem to prove superpolynomial lower bounds for Frege. Our construction is optimal for proofs of formulas of unbounded depth. As a consequence of our main result, we are able to shed some light on the question of automatizability for bounded-depth Frege systems. First, we present a simpler proof of the results of Bonet et al. showing that under cryptographic assumptions, bounded-depth Frege proofs are not automatizable. Second, we show that because our proof is more general, under the right cryptographic assumptions, it could resolve the automatizability question for lower-depth Frege systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12530","fieldValue":"ACM"}
