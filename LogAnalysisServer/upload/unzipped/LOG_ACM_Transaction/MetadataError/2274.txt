For example, we see a person riding an object X or a plank bridging two objects. Current methods provide limited support to search for content based on such relations. We present raid, a relation-augmented image descriptor that supports queries based on inter-region relations. The key idea of our descriptor is to encode region-to-region relations as the spatial distribution of point-to-region relationships between two image regions. raid allows sketch-based retrieval and requires minimal training data, thus making it suited even for querying uncommon relations. We evaluate the proposed descriptor by querying into large image databases and successfully extract non-trivial images demonstrating complex inter-region relations, which are easily missed or erroneously classified by existing methods. We assess the robustness of raid on multiple datasets even when the region segmentation is computed automatically or very noisy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17535","fieldValue":"van Kaick, Oliver"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17535","fieldValue":" We introduce a co-analysis method which learns a functionality model for an object category, e.g., strollers or backpacks. Like previous works on functionality, we analyze object-to-object interactions and intra-object properties and relations. Differently from previous works, our model goes beyond providing a functionality-oriented descriptor for a single object; it prototypes the functionality of a category of 3D objects by co-analyzing typical interactions involving objects from the category. Furthermore, our co-analysis localizes the studied properties to the specific locations, or surface patches, that support specific functionalities, and then integrates the patch-level properties into a category functionality model. Thus our model focuses on the how, via common interactions, and where, via patch localization, of functionality analysis. Given a collection of 3D objects belonging to the same category, with each object provided within a scene context, our co-analysis yields a set of proto-patches, each of which is a patch prototype supporting a specific type of interaction, e.g., stroller handle held by hand. The learned category functionality model is composed of proto-patches, along with their pairwise relations, which together summarize the functional properties of all the patches that appear in the input object category. With the learned functionality models for various object categories serving as a knowledge base, we are able to form a functional understanding of an individual 3D object, without a scene context. With patch localization in the model, functionality-aware modeling, e.g, functional object enhancement and the creation of functional object hybrids, is made possible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17536","fieldValue":" Patterns play a central role in 2D graphic design. A critical step in the design of patterns is evaluating multiple design alternatives. Exploring these alternatives with existing tools is challenging because most tools force users to work with a single fixed representation of the pattern that encodes a specific set of geometric relationships between pattern elements. However, for most patterns, there are many different interpretations of its regularity that correspond to different design variations. The exponential nature of this variation space makes the problem of finding all variations intractable. We present a method called PATEX to characterize and efficiently identify distinct and valid pattern variations, allowing users to directly navigate the variation space. Technically, we propose a novel linear approximation to handle the complexity of the problem and efficiently enumerate suitable pattern variations under proposed element movements. We also present two pattern editing interfaces that expose the detected pattern variations as suggested edits to the user. We show a diverse collection of pattern edits and variations created with PATEX. The results from our user study indicate that our suggested variations can be useful and inspirational for typical pattern editing tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17536","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17536","fieldValue":"ACM"}
