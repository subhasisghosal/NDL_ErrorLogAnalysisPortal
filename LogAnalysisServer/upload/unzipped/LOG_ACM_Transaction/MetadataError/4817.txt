The existing semantic-preserving hashing methods leverage the labeled data to learn a fixed set of semantic-aware hash functions. However, a fixed hash function set is unable to well encode all semantic information simultaneously, and ignores the specific user's search intention conveyed by the query. In this article, we propose a query-adaptive hashing method which is able to generate the most appropriate binary codes for different queries. Specifically, a set of semantic-biased discriminant projection matrices are first learnt for each of the semantic concepts, through which a semantic-adaptable hash function set is learnt via a joint sparsity variable selection model. At query time, we further use the sparsity representation procedure to select the most appropriate hash function subset that is informative to the semantic information conveyed by the query. Extensive experiments over three benchmark image datasets well demonstrate the superiority of our proposed query-adaptive hashing method over the state-of-the-art ones in terms of retrieval accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25484","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25484","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25485","fieldValue":"Zheng, Yan-Tao"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25485","fieldValue":"Zha, Zheng-Jun"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25485","fieldValue":"Chua, Tat-Seng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25485","fieldValue":" GPS devices have been widely used in automobiles to compute navigation routes to destinations. The generated driving route targets the minimal traveling distance, but neglects the sightseeing experience of the route. In this study, we propose an augmented GPS navigation system, GPSView, to incorporate a scenic factor into the routing. The goal of GPSView is to plan a driving route with scenery and sightseeing qualities, and therefore allow travelers to enjoy sightseeing on the drive. To do so, we first build a database of scenic roadways with vistas of landscapes and sights along the roadside. Specifically, we adapt an attention-based approach to exploit community-contributed GPS-tagged photos on the Internet to discover scenic roadways. The premise is: a multitude of photos taken along a roadway imply that this roadway is probably appealing and catches the public's attention. By analyzing the geospatial distribution of photos, the proposed approach discovers the roadside sight spots, or Points-Of-Interest (POIs), which have good scenic qualities and visibility to travelers on the roadway. Finally, we formulate scenic driving route planning as an optimization task towards the best trade-off between sightseeing experience and traveling distance. Testing in the northern California area shows that the proposed system can deliver promising results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25485","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25485","fieldValue":"ACM"}
