We show that a rich set of behavior variations can be captured by determining the appropriate reward function in the reinforcement learning framework, and show that the discovered reward function can be applied to different environments and scenarios. We also introduce a new algorithm to recover the unknown reward function that improves over the original apprenticeship learning algorithm. We show that the reward function representing a behavior style can be applied to a variety of different tasks, while still preserving the key features of the style present in the given examples. We describe an adaptive process where an author can, with just a few additional examples, refine the behavior so that it has better generalization properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16328","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16328","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2548","fieldValue":" In this article, we provide the multivariate generating function counting texts according to their length and to the number of occurrences of words from a finite set. The application of the inclusion-exclusion principle to word counting due to Goulden and Jackson [1979, 1983] is used to derive the result. Unlike some other techniques which suppose that the set of words is reduced (i.e., where no two words are factor of one another), the finite set can be chosen arbitrarily. Noonan and Zeilberger [1999] already provided a Maple package treating the nonreduced case, without giving an expression of the generating function or a detailed proof. We provide a complete proof validating the use of the inclusion-exclusion principle. Some formul√¶ for expected values, variance, and covariance for number of occurrences when considering two arbitrary sets of finite words are given as an application of our methodology."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2548","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2548","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16329","fieldValue":"Olivier, Anne-Hlne"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16329","fieldValue":" In the everyday exercise of controlling their locomotion, humans rely on their optic flow of the perceived environment to achieve collision-free navigation. In crowds, in spite of the complexity of the environment made of numerous obstacles, humans demonstrate remarkable capacities in avoiding collisions. Cognitive science work on human locomotion states that relatively succinct information is extracted from the optic flow to achieve safe locomotion. In this paper, we explore a novel vision-based approach of collision avoidance between walkers that fits the requirements of interactive crowd simulation. By simulating humans based on cognitive science results, we detect future collisions as well as the level of danger from visual stimuli. The motor-response is twofold: a reorientation strategy prevents future collision, whereas a deceleration strategy prevents imminent collisions. Several examples of our simulation results show that the emergence of self-organized patterns of walkers is reinforced using our approach. The emergent phenomena are visually appealing. More importantly, they improve the overall efficiency of the walkers' traffic and avoid improbable locking situations."}
