We call this model Accumulation-based Congestion Control (ACC), which fits into the nonlinear optimization framework proposed by Kelly. The ACC model serves as a reference for packet-switching network implementations. We show that TCP Vegas is one possible scheme under this model. It is well known that Vegas suffers from round trip propagation delay estimation error and reverse path congestion. We therefore design a new Monaco scheme that solves these problems by employing an out-of-band, receiver-based accumulation estimator, with the support of two FIFO priority queues from the (congested) routers. Comparisons between these two schemes demonstrate that Monaco does not suffer from the problems mentioned above and achieves better performance than Vegas. We use ns-2 simulations and Linux implementation experiments to show that the static and dynamic performance of Monaco matches the theoretic results. One key issue regarding the ACC model in general, i.e., the scalability of bottleneck buffer requirement, and a solution using a virtual queueing algorithm are discussed and evaluated."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9314","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9314","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9314","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9314","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9315","fieldValue":" In this paper, we evaluate the performance of both real and virtual queue-based marking schemes designed for use at routers in the Internet. Using fluid flow models, we show via analysis and simulations that Virtual Queue (VQ)-based marking schemes outperform Real Queue (RQ)-based marking schemes in terms of robustness to disturbances and the ability to maintain low queueing delays. In fact, we prove that a linearized model of RQ-based marking schemes exhibit a lack of robustness to constant but otherwise unknown levels of disturbances. The analytical results we present are applicable to combinations of proportionally fair and TCP-type congestion controllers at the source, and Random Exponential Marking (REM) and Proportional Control (PC) schemes at the router. The behavior of Random Early Discard (RED) and Proportional-Integral (PI) control schemes at the router are also studied via simulations."}
