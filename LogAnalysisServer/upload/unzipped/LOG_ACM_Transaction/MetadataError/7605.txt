Specifically, in a large-deviation setting, we are interested in algorithms that maximize the asymptotic decay rate of the queue-overflow probability, as the queue-overflow threshold approaches infinity. We first derive an upper bound on the decay rate of the queue-overflow probability over all scheduling policies. We then focus on a class of scheduling algorithms collectively referred to as the \"Î±-algorithms.\" For a given Î± â\u2030¥ 1, the Î±-algorithm picks the user for service at each time that has the largest product of the transmission rate multiplied by the backlog raised to the power Î±. We show that when the overflow metric is appropriately modified, the minimum-cost-to-overflow under the Î±-algorithm can be achieved by a simple linear path, and it can be written as the solution of a vector-optimization problem. Using this structural property, we then show that when Î± approaches infinity, the Î±-algorithms asymptotically achieve the largest decay rate of the queue-overflow probability. Finally, this result enables us to design scheduling algorithms that are both close to optimal in terms of the asymptotic decay rate of the overflow probability and empirically shown to maintain small queue-overflow probabilities over queue-length ranges of practical interest."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10020","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10020","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10020","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10021","fieldValue":"De Veciana, Gustavo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10021","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study several ways in which mobile terminals can backoff on their uplink transmit power in order to extend battery lifetimes. This is particularly effective when a wireless system is underloaded as the degradation in user's perceived quality of service can be negligible. The challenge, however, is developing a mechanism that achieves a good tradeoff among transmit power, idling\/circuit power, and the performance customers will see. We consider systems with flow-level dynamics supporting either real-time or best effort (e.g., file transfers) sessions. The energy-optimal transmission strategy for real-time sessions is determined by solving a convex optimization. An iterative approach exhibiting superlinear convergence achieves substantial amount energy savings, e.g., more than 50% when the session blocking probability is 0.1% or less. The case of file transfers is more subtle because power backoff changes the system dynamics. We study energy-efficient transmission strategies that realize energy-delay tradeoff. The proposed mechanism achieves a 35%-75% in energy savings depending on the load and file transfer target throughput. A key insight, relative to previous work focusing on static scenarios, is that idling power has a significant impact on energy-efficiency, while circuit power has limited impact as the load increases."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10021","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
