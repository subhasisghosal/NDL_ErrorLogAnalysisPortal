Stability is defined to measure the extent to which a recommendation algorithm provides predictions that are consistent with each other. Specifically, for a stable algorithm, adding some of the algorithmâ\u20AC™s own predictions to the algorithmâ\u20AC™s training data (for example, if these predictions were confirmed as accurate by users) would not invalidate or change the other predictions. While stability is an interesting theoretical property that can provide additional understanding about recommendation algorithms, we believe stability to be a desired practical property for recommender systems designers as well, because unstable recommendations can potentially decrease usersâ\u20AC™ trust in recommender systems and, as a result, reduce usersâ\u20AC™ acceptance of recommendations. In this article, we also provide an extensive empirical evaluation of stability for six popular recommendation algorithms on four real-world datasets. Our results suggest that stability performance of individual recommendation algorithms is consistent across a variety of datasets and settings. In particular, we find that model-based recommendation algorithms consistently demonstrate higher stability than neighborhood-based collaborative filtering techniques. In addition, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis of many important factors (e.g., the sparsity of original rating data, normalization of input data, the number of new incoming ratings, the distribution of incoming ratings, the distribution of evaluation data, etc.) and report the impact they have on recommendation stability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24064","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24064","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24065","fieldValue":" Despite the increased prevalence of sentiment-related information on the Web, there has been limited work on focused crawlers capable of effectively collecting not only topic-relevant but also sentiment-relevant content. In this article, we propose a novel focused crawler that incorporates topic and sentiment information as well as a graph-based tunneling mechanism for enhanced collection of opinion-rich Web content regarding a particular topic. The graph-based sentiment (GBS) crawler uses a text classifier that employs both topic and sentiment categorization modules to assess the relevance of candidate pages. This information is also used to label nodes in web graphs that are employed by the tunneling mechanism to improve collection recall. Experimental results on two test beds revealed that GBS was able to provide better precision and recall than seven comparison crawlers. Moreover, GBS was able to collect a large proportion of the relevant content after traversing far fewer pages than comparison methods. GBS outperformed comparison methods on various categories of Web pages in the test beds, including collection of blogs, Web forums, and social networking Web site content. Further analysis revealed that both the sentiment classification module and graph-based tunneling mechanism played an integral role in the overall effectiveness of the GBS crawler."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24066","fieldValue":"You, Gae-Won"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24066","fieldValue":"Hwang, Seung-Won"}
