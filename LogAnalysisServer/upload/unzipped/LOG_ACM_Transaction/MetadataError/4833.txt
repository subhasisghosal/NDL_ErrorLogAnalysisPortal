Our hypothesis is that the strategies in gestural responses depend on the level of identification of the sound source and specifically on the identification of the action causing the sound. To validate our hypothesis, we conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, we built two corpora of sounds. The first corpus contains sounds with identifiable causal actions. The second contains sounds for which no causal actions could be identified. These corpora properties were validated through a listening test. In the second experiment, participants performed arm and hand gestures synchronously while listening to sounds taken from these corpora. Afterward, we conducted interviews asking participants to verbalize their experience while watching their own video recordings. They were questioned on their perception of the listened sounds and on their gestural strategies. We showed that for the sounds where causal action can be identified, participants mainly mimic the action that has produced the sound. In the other case, when no action can be associated with the sound, participants trace contours related to sound acoustic features. We also found that the interparticipants‚\u20ACô gesture variability is higher for causal sounds compared to noncausal sounds. Variability demonstrates that, in the first case, participants have several ways of producing the same action, whereas in the second case, the sound features tend to make the gesture responses consistent."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3465","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3465","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25523","fieldValue":" The last great advances in immersive communication were the invention of the telephone over 137 years ago and the invention of the video telephone (n√© television) over 86 years ago. However, a perfect storm is brewing for the next advance in immersive communication, thanks to the convergence of massive amounts of computation, bandwidth, resolution, new sensors, and new displays. It could well be the Multimedia community that turns this brew into the next great advance in immersive communication, something akin to teleportation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25524","fieldValue":"Chang, Shih-Fu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25524","fieldValue":" This article reviews the major research trends that emerged in the last two decades within the broad area of multimedia information retrieval, with a focus on the ACM Multimedia community. Trends are defined (nonscientifically) to be topics that appeared in ACM multimedia publications and have had a significant number of citations. The article also assesses the impacts of these trends on real-world applications. The views expressed are subjective and likely biased but hopefully useful for understanding the heritage of the community and stimulating new research direction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25524","fieldValue":"ACM"}
