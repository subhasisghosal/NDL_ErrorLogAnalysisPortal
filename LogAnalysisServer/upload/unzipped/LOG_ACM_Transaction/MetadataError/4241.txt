To attack this problem, several existing and proposed systems employ brokers to direct user queries, using a local database of summary information about the available databases. This summary information must effectively distinguish relevant databases and must be compact while allowing efficient access. We offer evidence that one broker, GlOSS, can be effective at locating databases of interest even in a system of hundreds of databased and can examine the performance of accessing theGlOSS summeries for two promising storage methods: the grid file and partitioned hashing. We show that both methods can be tuned to provide good performance for a particular workload (within a broad range of workloads), and we discuss the tradeoffs between the two data structures. As a side effect of our work, we show that grid files are more broadly applicable than previously thought; inparticular, we show that by varying the policies used to construct the grid file we can provide good performance for a wide range of workloads even when storing highly skewed data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23778","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23778","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1245","fieldValue":" We introduce the Read-Write-Coding-System (RWC), a very flexible class of linear block codes that generate efficient and flexible erasure codes for storage networks. In particular, given a message x of k symbols and a codeword y of n symbols, an RW code defines additional parameters kâ\u2030¤ r,wâ\u2030¤ n that offer enhanced possibilities to adjust the fault-tolerance capability of the code. More precisely, an RWC provides linear (n,r,d)-codes that have: (a) minimum (Hamming) distance d = n-r&plus;1 for any two codewords, and (b) for any codeword $y_1 there exists a codeword y2 with distance of at most w. Furthermore, depending on the values r,w and the code alphabet, different block codes such as parity codes (e.g., RAID 4\/5) or Reed-Solomon (RS) codes (if r = k and thus, w = n) can be generated. In storage networks in which I\/O accesses are very costly and redundancy is crucial, this flexibility has considerable advantages as r and w can optimally be adapted to read or write intensive applications; only w symbols must be updated if the message x changes completely, which is different from other codes that always need to rewrite y completely as x changes. In this article, we first state a tight lower bound and basic conditions for all RW codes. Furthermore, we introduce special RW codes in which all mentioned parameters are adjustable even online, that is, RW codes which are adaptive to changing demands. At last, we investigate the question for which choices of (k,r,w,n) a coding system exists over the binary alphabet F2$ = {0,1} and discuss how RW codes can be combined."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1245","fieldValue":"RAID"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23779","fieldValue":" An earlier paper developed a procedure for compressing concordances, assuming that all alements occurred independently. The models introduced in that paper are extended here to take the possiblity of clustering into account. The concordance is conceptualized as a set of bitmaps, in which the bit locations reporesent documents, and the one-bits represent the occurrence of given terms. Hidden Markov Models (HMM's) are used to describe the clustering of the one-bits. However, for computational reasons, the HMM is approximated by traditional Markov models. A set of criteria is developed to constrain the allowable set of n-state models, and a full inventory is given for n â\u2030¤ 4. Graph-theoretic reduction and complementation operations are defined among the various models and are used to provide a structure relating the models studied. Finally, the new methods were tested on the concordances of the English Bible and of two of the world's largest full-text retrieval systems: the TreÂ´sor de la Langue FrancÂ¸aise and the Responsa Project."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23779","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23779","fieldValue":"ACM"}
