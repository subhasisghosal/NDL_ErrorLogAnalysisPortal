Unfortunately, this creates an incentive for misbehavior by clients of interactive applications (e.g., gaming, telnet, web): to send \"dummy\" packets into the network at a TCP-fair rate even when they have no data to send, thus improving their performance in moments when they do have data to send. Even though no \"law\" is violated in this way, a large-scale deployment of such an approach has the potential to seriously jeopardize one of the core Internet's principles-- statistical multiplexing. We quantify, by means of analytical modeling and simulation, gains achievable by the above misbehavior. Our research indicates that easy-to-implement application-level techniques are capable of dramatically reducing incentives for conducting the above transgressions, still without compromising the idea of statistical multiplexing."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9964","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9964","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9964","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9964","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9965","fieldValue":" Network coding techniques are used to find the minimum-cost transmission scheme for multicast sessions with or without elastic rate demand. It is shown that in wireline networks, solving for the optimal coding subgraphs in network coding is equivalent to finding the optimal routing scheme in a multicommodity flow problem. A set of node-based distributed gradient projection algorithms are designed to jointly implement congestion control\/routing at the source node and \"virtual\" routing at intermediate nodes. The analytical framework and distributed algorithms are further extended to interference-limited wireless networks where link capacities are functions of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To achieve minimum-cost multicast in this setting, the transmission powers of links must be jointly optimized with coding subgraphs and multicast input rates. Node-based power allocation and power control algorithms are developed for the power optimization. The power algorithms, when iterated in conjunction with the congestion control and routing algorithms, converge to the jointly optimal multicast configuration. The scaling matrices required in the gradient projection algorithms are explicitly derived and are shown to guarantee fast convergence to the optimum from any initial condition."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9965","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9965","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9965","fieldValue":"ACM"}
