In order to represent the deformations well (in terms of a global metric), the basis functions usually have global support, and cannot capture localized deformations. While reduced-space basis functions can be localized to some extent, capturing truly local deformations would still require a very large number of precomputed basis functions, significantly degrading both precomputation and online performance. We present an efficient approach to handling local deformations that cannot be predicted, most commonly arising from contact and collisions, by augmenting the subspace basis with custom functions derived from analytic solutions to static loading problems. We also present a new cubature scheme designed to facilitate fast computation of the necessary runtime quantities while undergoing a changing basis. Our examples yield a two order of magnitude speedup over full-coordinate simulations, striking a desirable balance between runtime speeds and expressive ability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16889","fieldValue":"Ben-Chen, Mirela"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16889","fieldValue":" Planar shape interpolation is widely used in computer graphics applications. Despite a wealth of interpolation methods, there is currently no approach that produces shapes with a bounded amount of distortion with respect to the input. As a result, existing interpolation methods may produce shapes that are significantly different than the input and can suffer from fold-overs and other visual artifacts, making them less useful in many practical scenarios. We introduce a novel shape interpolation scheme designed specifically to produce results with a bounded amount of conformal (angular) distortion. Our method is based on an elegant continuous mathematical formulation and provides several appealing properties such as existence and uniqueness of the solution as well as smoothness in space and time domains. We further present a discretization and an efficient practical algorithm to compute the interpolant and demonstrate its usability and good convergence behavior on a wide variety of input shapes. The method is simple to implement and understand. We compare our method to state-of-the-art interpolation methods and demonstrate its superiority in various cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16889","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16889","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16890","fieldValue":" We present a novel technique for acquiring the geometry and spatially-varying reflectance properties of 3D objects by observing them under continuous spherical harmonic illumination conditions. The technique is general enough to characterize either entirely specular or entirely diffuse materials, or any varying combination across the surface of the object. We employ a novel computational illumination setup consisting of a rotating arc of controllable LEDs which sweep out programmable spheres of incident illumination during 1-second exposures. We illuminate the object with a succession of spherical harmonic illumination conditions, as well as photographed environmental lighting for validation. From the response of the object to the harmonics, we can separate diffuse and specular reflections, estimate world-space diffuse and specular normals, and compute anisotropic roughness parameters for each view of the object. We then use the maps of both diffuse and specular reflectance to form correspondences in a multiview stereo algorithm, which allows even highly specular surfaces to be corresponded across views. The algorithm yields a complete 3D model and a set of merged reflectance maps. We use this technique to digitize the shape and reflectance of a variety of objects difficult to acquire with other techniques and present validation renderings which match well to photographs in similar lighting."}
