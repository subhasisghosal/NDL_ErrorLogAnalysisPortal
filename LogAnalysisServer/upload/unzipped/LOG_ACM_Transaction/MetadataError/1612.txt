We present a new technique for allowing our physically-simulated planar biped characters to imitate human behaviors. Our contribution is twofold. We developed an optimization method that transforms any (either motion-captured or kinematically synthesized) biped motion into a physically-feasible, balance-maintaining simulated motion. Our optimization method allows us to collect a rich set of training data that contains stylistic, personality-rich human behaviors. Our controller learning algorithm facilitates the creation and composition of robust dynamic controllers that are learned from training data. We demonstrate a planar articulated character that is dynamically simulated in real time, equipped with an integrated repertoire of motor skills, and controlled interactively to perform desired motions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15864","fieldValue":" Functions with densely interconnected expression graphs, which arise in computer graphics applications such as dynamics, space-time optimization, and PRT, can be difficult to efficiently differentiate using existing symbolic or automatic differentiation techniques. Our new algorithm, D*, computes efficient symbolic derivatives for these functions by symbolically executing the expression graph at compile time to eliminate common subexpressions and by exploiting the special nature of the graph that represents the derivative of a function. This graph has a sum of products form; the new algorithm computes a factorization of this derivative graph along with an efficient grouping of product terms into subexpressions. For the problems in our test suite D* generates symbolic derivatives which are up to 4.6 x $10^3 times faster than those computed by the symbolic math program Mathematica and up to 2.2x105$ times faster than the non-symbolic automatic differentiation program CppAD. In some cases the D* derivatives rival the best manually derived solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15865","fieldValue":" Several types of methods precompute or capture light transport operators in either virtual or real scenes. Precomputed radiance transfer methods interactively render realistic images of static scenes under dynamic incident illumination, while reflectance field techniques capture an appearance model of a real scene for relighting purposes. In this article we present a unifying mathematical framework for methods that precompute or capture light transport operators, and characterize a large body of earlier work in its terms. The framework is given in the form of an operator equation that extends the rendering equation to account for a constrained space of emissions. The connections between traditional global illumination methods and precomputed transfer techniques become apparent through the explicit equation. Based on insight provided by the unifying view, we outline possibilities for new methods, particularly the wider adaptation of previous, hierarchical finite element techniques for efficient computation of the transport operators."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15865","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15865","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15866","fieldValue":" We describe and analyze a subdivision scheme that generalizes bicubic spline subdivision to control nets with polar structure.

The resulting surfaces are $C^2 except at a finite number of isolated points where the surface is C1$ and the curvature is bounded."}
