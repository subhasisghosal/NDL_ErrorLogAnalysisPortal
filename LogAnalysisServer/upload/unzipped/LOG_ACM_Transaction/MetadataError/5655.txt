In the first case, two genes are positively and negatively correlated with each other under one and the other conditions, respectively. In the second case, multiple genes are coexpressed and randomly expressed under one and the other conditions, respectively. We summarize a variety of methods for the first and second cases into four and three approaches, respectively. We describe each of these approaches in detail technically, being followed by thorough comparative experiments with both synthetic and real data sets. Our experimental results imply high possibility of improving the efficiency of the current methods, particularly in the case of multiple genes, because of low performance achieved by the best methods which are relatively simple intuitive ones."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5030","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5031","fieldValue":" This paper presents a new computational technique for the identification of HIV haplotypes. HIV tends to generate many potentially drug-resistant mutants within the HIV-infected patient and being able to identify these different mutants is important for efficient drug administration. With the view of identifying the mutants, we aim at analyzing short deep sequencing data called reads. From a statistical perspective, the analysis of such data can be regarded as a nonstandard clustering problem due to missing pairwise similarity measures between non-overlapping reads. To overcome this problem we propagate a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model by sequentially updating the prior information from successive local analyses. The model is verified using both simulated and real sequencing data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5031","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5031","fieldValue":"HIV"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5031","fieldValue":"MCMC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5031","fieldValue":"ACM"}
