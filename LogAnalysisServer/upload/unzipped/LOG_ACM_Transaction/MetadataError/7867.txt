Their wireless transmission, processing, and storage capabilities enable them to support full automation of many inventory management functions in industry. This paper studies the practically important problem of monitoring a large set of active RFID tags and identifying the missing ones--the objects that the missing tags are associated with are likely to be missing as well. This monitoring function may need to be executed frequently and therefore should be made efficient in terms of execution time in order to avoid disruption of normal inventory operations. Based on probabilistic methods, we design a series of missing-tag identification protocols that employ novel techniques to reduce the execution time. Our best protocol reduces the time for detecting the missing tags by an order of magnitude when compared to existing protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10547","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10548","fieldValue":"Vullikanti, Anil Kumar S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10548","fieldValue":" We study the problem of throughput maximization in multihop wireless networks with end-to-end delay constraints for each session. This problem has received much attention starting with the work of Grossglauser and Tse (2002), and it has been shown that there is a significant tradeoff between the end-to-end delays and the total achievable rate. We develop algorithms to compute such tradeoffs with provable performance guarantees for arbitrary instances, with general interference models. Given a target delay-bound Î\u201D(c) for each session c, our algorithm gives a stable flow vector with a total throughput within a factor of O(log Î\u201Dm\/log Î\u201Dm) of the maximum, so that the persession (end-to-end) delay is O(((log Î\u201Dm\/log log $Î\u201Dm)Î\u201D(c))^2$), where Î\u201Dm = maxc{Î\u201D(c)}; note that these bounds depend only on the delays, and not on the network size, and this is the first such result, to our knowledge."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10548","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10548","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10548","fieldValue":"ACM"}
