Central user modeling servers collect and process the information about users that different user-adaptive systems require to personalize their user interaction.Adaptive systems are generally better able to cater to users the more data their user modeling systems collect and process about them. They therefore gather as much data as possible and \"lay them in stock\" for possible future usage. Moreover, data collection usually takes place without users' initiative and sometimes even without their awareness, in order not to cause distraction. Both is in conflict with users' privacy concerns that became manifest in numerous recent consumer polls, and with data protection laws and guidelines that call for parsimony, purpose-orientation, and user notification or user consent when personal data are collected and processed.This article discusses security requirements to guarantee privacy in user-adaptive systems and explores ways to keep users anonymous while fully preserving personalized interaction with them. User anonymization in personalized systems goes beyond current models in that not only users must remain anonymous, but also the user modeling system that maintains their personal data. Moreover, users' trust in anonymity can be expected to lead to more extensive and frank interaction, hence to more and better data about the user, and thus to better personalization. A reference model for pseudonymous and secure user modeling is presented that meets many of the proposed requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24280","fieldValue":"KQML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24280","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24280","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24281","fieldValue":" Due to the proliferation of online auctions, there is an increasing need to monitor and bid in multiple auctions in order to procure the best deal for the desired good. To this end, this paper reports on the development of a heuristic decision making framework that an autonomous agent can exploit to tackle the problem of bidding across multiple auctions with varying start and end times and with varying protocols (including English, Dutch and Vickrey). The framework is flexible, configurable, and enables the agent to adopt varying tactics and strategies that attempt to ensure that the desired item is delivered in a manner consistent with the user's preferences. Given this large space of possibilities, we employ a genetic algorithm to search (offline) for effective strategies in common classes of environment. The strategies that emerge from this evolution are then codified into the agent's reasoning behaviour so that it can select the most appropriate strategy to employ in its prevailing circumstances. The proposed framework has been implemented in a simulated marketplace environment and its effectiveness has been empirically demonstrated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3354","fieldValue":"Creem-Regehr, Sarah H."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3354","fieldValue":" Most head-mounted displays (HMDs) suffer from substantial optical distortion, and vendor-supplied specifications for field-of-view often are at variance with reality. Unless corrected, such displays do not present perspective-related visual cues in a geometrically correct manner. Distorted geometry has the potential to affect applications of HMDs, which depend on precise spatial perception. This article provides empirical evidence for the degree to which common geometric distortions affect one type of spatial judgment in virtual environments. We show that minification or magnification in the HMD that would occur from misstated HMD field of view causes significant changes in distance judgments. Incorrectly calibrated pitch and pincushion distortion, however, do not cause statistically significant changes in distance judgments for the degree of distortions examined. While the means for determining the optical distortion of display systems are well known, they are often not used in non-see-through HMDs due to problems in measuring and correcting for distortion. As a result, we also provide practical guidelines for creating geometrically calibrated systems."}
