It is the aim of this work to validate this intuition by showing that figurative language (metaphors) appearing in a sentence drive the polarity of that sentence. Towards this target, the current article proposes an approach for sentiment analysis of sentences where figurative language plays a dominant role. This approach applies Word Sense Disambiguation aiming to assign polarity to word senses rather than tokens. Sentence polarity is determined using the individual polarities for metaphorical senses as well as other contextual information. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves high scores in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches tested on the same corpora. Finally, experimental results provide supportive evidence that this method is also well suited for corpora consisting of literal and figurative language sentences."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23077","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23077","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23078","fieldValue":" With the growing interest in statistical parsing, special attention has recently been devoted to the problem of comparing different treebanks to assess which languages or domains are more difficult to parse relative to a given model. A common methodology for comparing parsing difficulty across treebanks is based on the use of the standard labeled precision and recall measures. As an alternative, in this article we propose an information-theoretic measure, called the expected conditional cross-entropy (ECC). One important advantage with respect to standard performance measures is that ECC can be directly expressed as a function of the parameters of the model. We evaluate ECC across several treebanks for English, French, German, and Italian, and show that ECC is an effective measure of parsing difficulty, with an increase in ECC always accompanied by a degradation in parsing accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23078","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23078","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23079","fieldValue":" Affect interpretation from open-ended drama improvisation is a challenging task. This article describes experiments in using latent semantic analysis to identify discussion themes and potential target audiences for those improvisational inputs without strong affect indicators. A context-based affect-detection is also implemented using a supervised neural network with the consideration of emotional contexts of most intended audiences, sentence types, and interpersonal relationships. In order to go beyond the constraints of predefined scenarios and improve the system's robustness, min-margin-based active learning is implemented. This active learning algorithm also shows great potential in dealing with imbalanced affect classifications. Evaluation results indicated that the context-based affect detection achieved an averaged precision of 0.826 and an averaged recall of 0.813 for affect detection of the test inputs from the Crohn's disease scenario using three emotion labels: positive, negative, and neutral, and an averaged precision of 0.868 and an average recall of 0.876 for the test inputs from the school bullying scenario. Moreover, experimental evaluation on a benchmark data set for active learning demonstrated that active learning was able to greatly reduce human annotation efforts for the training of affect detection, and also showed promising robustness in dealing with open-ended example inputs beyond the improvisation of the chosen scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23079","fieldValue":"ACM"}
