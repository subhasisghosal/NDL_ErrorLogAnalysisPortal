In this problem we are given two n Ã\u2014 n nonnegative symmetric matrices A &equals; $(a_ij) and B &equals; (bij). The objective is to compute a permutation Ï\u20AC of V &equals; {1,â\u20AC¦,n} so that âˆ\u2018 i,jâˆˆViâ\u2030 j aÏ\u20AC(i),Ï\u20AC(j)bi,j$ is minimized. We assume that A is a 0\/1 incidence matrix of a graph, and that B satisfies the triangle inequality. We analyze the approximability of this class of problems by providing polynomial bounded approximations for some special cases, and inapproximability results for other cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14946","fieldValue":"Boissonnat, Jean-Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14946","fieldValue":"ACM"}
