Our vision can be seen as a distributed generalization of the self-adjusting datastructures introduced by Sleator and Tarjan, 1985: In contrast to their splay trees which dynamically optimize the lookup costs from a single node (namely the tree root), we seek to minimize the routing cost between arbitrary communication pairs in the network. As a first step, we study distributed binary search trees (BSTs), which are attractive for their support of greedy routing. We introduce a simple model which captures the fundamental tradeoff between the benefits and costs of self-adjusting networks. We present the SplayNet algorithm and formally analyze its performance, and prove its optimality in specific case studies. We also introduce lower bound techniques based on interval cuts and edge expansion, to study the limitations of any demand-optimized network. Finally, we extend our study to multi-tree networks, and highlight an intriguing difference between classic and distributed splay trees."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10903","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10903","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10903","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10903","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10904","fieldValue":" Internet Service Provider design of service tiers are modeled and analyzed, based on demand for web browsing and video streaming. A basic model that considers user willingness to pay, network capacity, and application performance is formulated to determine when multiple tiers maximize profit. An extended model that also considers the time that users devote to each application is formulated to determine the optimal network capacity, tier rates, and tier prices. We show that an Internet Service Provider may simplify tier and capacity design by allowing its engineering department to set network capacity, its marketing department to set tier prices, and both to jointly set tier rates. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the magnitude of the decrease in profit compared to the optimal profit resulting from such a simplified design."}
