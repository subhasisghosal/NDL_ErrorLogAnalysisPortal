We construct an estimator for the time-average variance constant that is based on iterated integrations of the sample path. When the observations are batched, the method generalizes the method of batch means. One advantage of the method is that it can be used without batching the observations; that is, it can allow for the process variance to be estimated at any time as the simulation runs without waiting for a fixed time horizon to complete. When used in conjunction with batching, the method can improve efficiency (the reciprocal of work times mean-squared error) compared with the standard method of batch means. In numerical experiments, efficiency improvement ranged from a factor of 1.5 (for the waiting time sequence in an M\/M\/1 queueing system with a single integrated path) up to a factor of 14 (for an autoregressive process and 19 integrated paths)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24946","fieldValue":" Importance sampling is a variance reduction technique for efficient estimation of rare-event probabilities by Monte Carlo. For random variables with heavy tails there is little consensus on how to choose the change of measure used in importance sampling. In this article we study dynamic importance sampling schemes for sums of independent and identically distributed random variables with regularly varying tails. The number of summands can be random but must be independent of the summands. For estimating the probability that the sum exceeds a given threshold, we explicitly identify a class of dynamic importance sampling algorithms with bounded relative errors. In fact, these schemes are nearly asymptotically optimal in the sense that the second moment of the corresponding importance sampling estimator can be made as close as desired to the minimal possible value."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3413","fieldValue":"Souman, J L"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3413","fieldValue":"Blthoff, H H"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3413","fieldValue":"Ernst, M O"}
