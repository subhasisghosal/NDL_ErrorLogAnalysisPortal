The recent widespread use of Internet technology has increased the accessibility of the general population to financial data, thereby increasing the average portfolio size. This increase, compounded by the need for accurate real-time results, has led to a rising demand for faster risk simulations. Often, accurately pricing widespread instruments, such as Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs), can take excessively long due to their multifactor assets dependency. We present a hardware implementation for a MultiFactor Gaussian Copula (MFGC) CDO pricing algorithm. Through a detailed benchmark exploration we demonstrate how reconfigurable hardware could be used to exploit fine-grain parallelism. Our results show that our implementation mapped onto a Xilinx Virtex 5 (XC5VSX50T) FPGA is over 71 times faster than corresponding software running on a single core 3.4 GHz Intel Xeon processor."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21782","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21782","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21782","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3083","fieldValue":"Yeh, Jui-Feng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3083","fieldValue":"Chen, Wen-Yi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3083","fieldValue":"Su, Mao-Chuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3083","fieldValue":" An approach is proposed for Chinese spelling error detection and correction, in which an inverted index list with a rescoring mechanism is used. The inverted index list is a structure for mapping from word to desired sentence, and for representing nodes in lattices constructed through character expansion (according to predefined phonologically and visually similar character sets). Pruning based on a contextual dependency confidence measure was used to markedly reduce the search space and computational complexity. Relevant mapping relations between the original input and desired input were obtained using a scoring mechanism composed of class-based language and maximum entropy correction models containing character, word, and contextual features. The proposed method was evaluated using data sets provided by SigHan 7 bakeoff. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved acceptable performance in terms of recall rate or precision rate in error sentence detection and error location detection, and it outperformed other approaches in error location detection and correction."}
