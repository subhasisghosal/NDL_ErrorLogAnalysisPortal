In this paper, we study how to infer the evolutionary history of a PPI network from its protein duplication relationship. We show that for a plausible evolutionary history of a PPI network, its relative quality, measured by the so-called loss number, is independent of the growth parameters of the network and can be computed efficiently. This finding leads us to propose two fast maximum likelihood algorithms to infer the evolutionary history of a PPI network given the duplication history of its proteins. Simulation studies demonstrated that our approach, which takes advantage of protein duplication information, outperforms NetArch, the first maximum likelihood algorithm for PPI network history reconstruction. Using the proposed method, we studied the topological change of the PPI networks of the yeast, fruitfly, and worm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5001","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5001","fieldValue":"Maximum Likelihood Inference of the Evolutionary History of a PPI Network from the Duplication History of Its Proteins"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5002","fieldValue":" Computational cancer phylogenetics seeks to enumerate the temporal sequences of aberrations in tumor evolution, thereby delineating the evolution of possible tumor progression pathways, molecular subtypes, and mechanisms of action. We previously developed a pipeline for constructing phylogenies describing evolution between major recurring cell types computationally inferred from whole-genome tumor profiles. The accuracy and detail of the phylogenies, however, depend on the identification of accurate, high-resolution molecular markers of progression, i.e., reproducible regions of aberration that robustly differentiate different subtypes and stages of progression. Here, we present a novel hidden Markov model (HMM) scheme for the problem of inferring such phylogenetically significant markers through joint segmentation and calling of multisample tumor data. Our method classifies sets of genome-wide DNA copy number measurements into a partitioning of samples into normal (diploid) or amplified at each probe. It differs from other similar HMM methods in its design specifically for the needs of tumor phylogenetics, by seeking to identify robust markers of progression conserved across a set of copy number profiles. We show an analysis of our method in comparison to other methods on both synthetic and real tumor data, which confirms its effectiveness for tumor phylogeny inference and suggests avenues for future advances."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5002","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
