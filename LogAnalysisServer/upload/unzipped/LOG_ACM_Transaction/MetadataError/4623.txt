{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24949","fieldValue":" The particular statistical properties found in network measurements, namely self-similarity and long-range dependence, cannot be ignored in modeling network and Internet traffic. Thus, despite their mathematical tractability, traditional Markov models are not appropriate for this purpose, since their memoryless nature contradicts the burstiness of transmitted packets. However, it is desirable to find a similarly tractable model which is, at the same time, rigorous at capturing the features of network traffic. This work presents discrete-time heavy-tailed chains, a tractable approach to characterize network traffic as a superposition of discrete-time â\u20ACœon\/offâ\u20AC? sources. This is a particular case of the generic â\u20ACœon\/offâ\u20AC? heavy-tailed model, thus shows the same statistical features as the former, particularly self-similarity and long-range dependence, when the number of aggregated sources approaches infinity. The model is then applicable to characterize a number of discrete-time communication systems, for instance, ATM and optical packet switching, to further derive meaningful performance metrics such as average burst duration and the number of active sources in a random instant."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24949","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24949","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24950","fieldValue":" A new algorithm for sampling from largely arbitrary monotone, unbounded densities is presented. The user has to provide a program to evaluate the density and its derivative and the location of the pole. Then the setup of the new algorithm constructs different hat functions for the pole region and tail region, respectively. For the pole region a new method is developed that uses a transformed density rejection hat function of the inverse density. As the order of the pole is calculated in the setup, conditions that guarantee correctness of the constructed hat functions are provided. Numerical experiments indicate that the new algorithm works correctly and moderately fast for many different unbounded densities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24951","fieldValue":" The goal of this article is to provide a general framework for locally convergent random-search algorithms for stochastic optimization problems when the objective function is embedded in a stochastic simulation and the decision variables are integer ordered. The framework guarantees desirable asymptotic properties, including almost-sure convergence and known rate of convergence, for any algorithms that conform to its mild conditions. Within this framework, algorithm designers can incorporate sophisticated search schemes and complicated statistical procedures to design new algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24952","fieldValue":"Hsu, Chih-Chieh"}
