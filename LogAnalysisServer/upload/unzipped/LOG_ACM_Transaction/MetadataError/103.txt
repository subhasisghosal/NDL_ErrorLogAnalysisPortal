We designed a puzzle game that players can answer correctly if they understand the fundamental concepts of automata theory. In our investigation, 90 children played the game, and their actions were recorded in play logs. An analysis of the play logs shows that approximately 60&percnt; of the children achieved correct-answer rates of at least 70&percnt;, which suggests that primary and lower secondary school students can understand the fundamental concepts of automata theory. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that most of them do not fully understand automata theory, but some of them have a good understanding of the concept."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11246","fieldValue":"Computer Science Education for Primary and Lower Secondary School Students: Teaching the Concept of Automata"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11247","fieldValue":" Is there any relationship between studentsâ\u20AC™ cognitive style and the ability to learn programming through serious games? The aim of this work is to assess the learning effectiveness and motivational appeal of digital games for learning basic programming concepts, involving secondary education students. For this purpose, the $Code.org^Â®$â\u20AC™s activity named K-8 Intro to Computer Science was used. The study investigated studentsâ\u20AC™ attitudes from gaming activities to reveal the quality of their learning experience. Next, studentsâ\u20AC™ attitudes from games were correlated with their cognitive profile to reveal potential differences. Finally, studentsâ\u20AC™ performance from the digital games was assessed to reveal game-based learning (GBL) effectiveness compared to their cognitive styles. In the study, 77 students of two Greek high schools participated in the context of the European Code Week. The results suggest that these specific games, or similar educational computer games, can be exploited as effective and motivational learning environments within schools, as they provide a high-quality learning experience. Cognitive style was found to be a significant learning characteristic that should be taken into consideration when using digital games to learn programming."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11247","fieldValue":"How Do Different Cognitive Styles Affect Learning Programming?
