{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3302","fieldValue":" The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a thermal display that assists in object identification in virtual environments by simulating the thermal cues associated with making contact with materials with different thermal properties. The thermal display was developed based on a semi-infinite body model. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the display. The first experiment compared the ability of subjects' to identify various materials, which were presented physically or simulated with the thermal display. The second experiment examined the capacity of subjects to discriminate between a real and simulated material based on thermal cues. In the third experiment, the changes in skin temperature that occurred when making contact with real and simulated materials were measured to evaluate how these compare to theoretical predictions. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in material identification and discrimination when subjects were presented with real or simulated materials. The changes in skin temperature were comparable for real and simulated materials and were related to the contact coefficient of the material palpated, consistent with the semi-infinite body model. These findings suggest that a thermal display is capable of facilitating object recognition when visual cues are limited."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23715","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23715","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23716","fieldValue":" A simple collaborative tool, a shared text editor called ShrEdit, changed the way groups of designers performed their work, and changed it for the better. First, the designs produced by the 19 groups of three designers were of higher quality than those of the 19 groups who worked with conventional whiteboard, paper and pencil. The groups with the new tool reported liking their work process a little less, probably because they had to adapt their work style to a new tool. We expected, from the brainstorming literature and recent work on Group Support Systems, that the reason the designs were of better quality was that the supported groups generated more ideas. To our surprise, the groups working with ShrEdit generated fewer design ideas, but apparently better ones. It appears that the tool helped the supported groups keep more focused on the core issued in the emerging design, to waste less time on less important topics, and to capture what was said as they went. This suggests that small workgroups can capitalize on the free access they have to a shared workspace, without requiring a facilitator or a work process embedded in the software."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23716","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23716","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23717","fieldValue":" We describe the evolution of the novel shared drawing medium ClearBoard which was designed to seamlessly integrate an interpersonal space and a shared workspace. ClearBoard permits coworkers in two locations to draw with color markers or with electronic pens and software tools while maintaining direct eye contact and the ability to employ natural gestures. The ClearBoard design is based on the key metaphor of â\u20ACœtalking through and drawing on a transparent glass window.â\u20AC? We describe the evolution from ClearBoard-1 (which enables shared video drawing) to ClearBoard-2 (which incorporates TeamPaint, a multiuser paint editor). Initial observations and findings gained through the experimental use of the prototype, including the feature of â\u20ACœgaze awareness,â\u20AC? are discussed. Further experiments are conducted with ClearBoard-0 (a simple mockup), ClearBoard-1, and an actual desktop as a control. In the settings we examined, the ClearBoard environment led to more eye contact and potential awareness of collaborator's gaze direction over the traditional desktop environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23717","fieldValue":"ACM"}
