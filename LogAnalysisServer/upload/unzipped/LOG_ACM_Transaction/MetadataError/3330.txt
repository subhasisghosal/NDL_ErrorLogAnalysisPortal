This article is an extension of our previous study on disk failures [Schroeder and Gibson 2007] and presents and analyzes field-gathered disk replacement data from a number of large production systems, including high-performance computing sites and internet services sites. More than 110,000 disks are covered by this data, some for an entire lifetime of five years. The data includes drives with SCSI and FC, as well as SATA interfaces. The mean time-to-failure (MTTF) of those drives, as specified in their datasheets, ranges from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 hours, suggesting a nominal annual failure rate of at most 0.88&percnt;. We find that in the field, annual disk replacement rates typically exceed 1&percnt;, with 2--4&percnt; common and up to 13&percnt; observed on some systems. This suggests that field replacement is a fairly different process than one might predict based on datasheet MTTF. We also find evidence, based on records of disk replacements in the field, that failure rate is not constant with age, and that rather than a significant infant mortality effect, we see a significant early onset of wear-out degradation. In other words, the replacement rates in our data grew constantly with age, an effect often assumed not to set in until after a nominal lifetime of 5 years. Interestingly, we observe little difference in replacement rates between SCSI, FC, and SATA drives, potentially an indication that disk-independent factors such as operating conditions affect replacement rates more than component-specific ones. On the other hand, we see only one instance of a customer rejecting an entire population of disks as a bad batch, in this case because of media error rates, and this instance involved SATA disks. Time between replacement, a proxy for time between failure, is not well modeled by an exponential distribution and exhibits significant levels of correlation, including autocorrelation and long-range dependence."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20945","fieldValue":"MTTF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20946","fieldValue":" For five years, we collected annual snapshots of file-system metadata from over 60,000 Windows PC file systems in a large corporation. In this article, we use these snapshots to study temporal changes in file size, file age, file-type frequency, directory size, namespace structure, file-system population, storage capacity and consumption, and degree of file modification. We present a generative model that explains the namespace structure and the distribution of directory sizes. We find significant temporal trends relating to the popularity of certain file types, the origin of file content, the way the namespace is used, and the degree of variation among file systems, as well as more pedestrian changes in size and capacities. We give examples of consequent lessons for designers of file systems and related software."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3000","fieldValue":" This article presents two novel approaches for incorporating sentiment prior knowledge into the topic model for weakly supervised sentiment analysis where sentiment labels are considered as topics. One is by modifying the Dirichlet prior for topic-word distribution (LDA-DP), the other is by augmenting the model objective function through adding terms that express preferences on expectations of sentiment labels of the lexicon words using generalized expectation criteria (LDA-GE). We conducted extensive experiments on English movie review data and multi-domain sentiment dataset as well as Chinese product reviews about mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, and monitors. The results show that while both LDA-DP and LDA-GE perform comparably to existing weakly supervised sentiment classification algorithms, they are much simpler and computationally efficient, rendering them more suitable for online and real-time sentiment classification on the Web. We observed that LDA-GE is more effective than LDA-DP, suggesting that it should be preferred when considering employing the topic model for sentiment analysis. Moreover, both models are able to extract highly domain-salient polarity words from text."}
