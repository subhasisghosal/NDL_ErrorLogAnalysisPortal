Detection and annotation of SNPs are among the central topics in biomedical research as SNPs are believed to play important roles on the manifestation of phenotypic events, such as disease susceptibility. To take full advantage of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, we propose a Bayesian approach, BM-SNP, to identify SNPs based on the posterior inference using NGS data. In particular, BM-SNP computes the posterior probability of nucleotide variation at each covered genomic position using the contents and frequency of the mapped short reads. The position with a high posterior probability of nucleotide variation is flagged as a potential SNP. We apply BM-SNP to two cell-line NGS data, and the results show a high ratio of overlap (>95 percent) with the dbSNP database. Compared with MAQ, BM-SNP identifies more SNPs that are in dbSNP, with higher quality. The SNPs that are called only by BM-SNP but not in dbSNP may serve as new discoveries. The proposed BM-SNP method integrates information from multiple aspects of NGS data, and therefore achieves high detection power. BM-SNP is fast, capable of processing whole genome data at 20-fold average coverage in a short amount of time."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5110","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5110","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5110","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5111","fieldValue":" Flow cytometry is able to measure the expressions of multiple proteins simultaneously at the single-cell level. A flow cytometry experiment on one biological sample provides measurements of several protein markers on or inside a large number of individual cells in that sample. Analysis of such data often aims to identify subpopulations of cells with distinct phenotypes. Currently, the most widely used analytical approach in the flow cytometry community is manual gating on a sequence of nested biaxial plots, which is highly subjective, labor intensive, and not exhaustive. To address those issues, a number of methods have been developed to automate the gating analysis by clustering algorithms. However, completely removing the subjectivity can be quite challenging. This paper describes an alternative approach. Instead of automating the analysis, we develop novel visualizations to facilitate manual gating. The proposed method views single-cell data of one biological sample as a high-dimensional point cloud of cells, derives the skeleton of the cloud, and unfolds the skeleton to generate 2D visualizations. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed visualization using real data, and provide quantitative comparison to visualizations generated from principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5111","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
