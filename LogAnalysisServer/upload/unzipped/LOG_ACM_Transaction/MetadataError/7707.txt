The links in such networks are highly directional: Because of the small carrier wavelength (an order of magnitude smaller than those for existing cellular and wireless local area networks), narrow beams are essential for overcoming higher path loss and can be implemented using compact electronically steerable antenna arrays. Directionality drastically reduces interference, but it also leads to \"deafness,\" making implicit coordination using carrier sense infeasible. In this paper, we make a quantitative case for rethinking medium access control (MAC) design in such settings. Unlike existing MAC protocols for omnidirectional networks, where the focus is on interference management, we contend that MAC design for 60-GHz mesh networks can essentially ignore interference and must focus instead on the challenge of scheduling half-duplex transmissions with deaf neighbors. Our main contribution is an analytical framework for estimating the collision probability in such networks as a function of the antenna patterns and the density of simultaneously transmitting nodes. The numerical results from our interference analysis show that highly directional links can indeed be modeled as pseudowired, in that the collision probability is small even with a significant density of transmitters. Furthermore, simulation of a rudimentary directional slotted Aloha protocol shows that packet losses due to failed coordination are an order of magnitude higher than those due to collisions, confirming our analytical results and highlighting the need for more sophisticated coordination mechanisms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10227","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10227","fieldValue":"Interference analysis for highly directional 60-GHz mesh networks: the case for rethinking medium access control"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10227","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10227","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1128","fieldValue":" Collaborative Ubiquitous Environments (CUEs) are environments that support collaboration among persons in a context of ubiquitous computing. This article shows how results of the research in the Multi-Agent System (MAS) area, and in particular on MAS environments, can be used to model, design and engineer CUEs, with specific reference to the management of context-awareness information. After a description of the reference scenario, the Multilayered Multi-Agent Situated System model will be introduced and applied to represent and to manage several types of awareness information (both physical and logical contextual information). Finally, three different approaches to the design and engineering of CUEs will then be introduced and evaluated."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1128","fieldValue":"Awareness in collaborative ubiquitous environments: The Multilayered Multi-Agent Situated System approach"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1128","fieldValue":"ACM"}
