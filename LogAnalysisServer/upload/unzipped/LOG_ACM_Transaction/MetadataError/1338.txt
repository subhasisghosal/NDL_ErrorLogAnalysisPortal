The geometric constraint solver works in two phases: in the analysis phase the constraint graph is analyzed and a sequence of elementary construction steps is derived, and then in the construction phase the sequence of construction steps in actually carried out. The analysis phase of the algorithm is described in detail, its correctness is proved, and an efficient algorith to realized it is presented. The scope of the graph analysis is then extended by utilizing semantic information in the form of anlge derivations, and by extending the repertoire of the construction steps. Finally, the construction phase is briefly discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15146","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15146","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15147","fieldValue":" This article presents the density estimation framework for generating view-independent global illumination solutions. It works by probabilistically simulating the light flow in an environment with light particles that trace random walks origination at luminaires and then using statistical density estimation techniques to reconstruct the lighting on each surface. By splitting the computation into separate transport and reconstruction stages, we gain many advantages including reduced memory usage, the ability to simulate nondiffuse transport, and natural parallelism. Solutions to several theoretical and practical difficulties in implementing this framework are also described. Light sources that vary spectrally and directionally are integrated into a spectral particle tracer using nonuniform rejection. A new local linear density estimation technique eliminates boundary bias and extends to arbitrary polygons. A mesh decimation algorithm with perceptual calibration is introduced to simplify the Gouraud-shaded representation of the solution for interactive display."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15147","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15147","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15148","fieldValue":" One of the numerical criteria for color image quantization is to minimize the maximum discrepancy between original pixel colors and the corresponding quantized colors. This is typically carried out by first grouping color points into tight clusters and then finding a representative for each cluster. In this article we show that getting the smallest clusters under a formal notion of minimizing the maximum intercluster distance does not guarantee an optimal solution for the quantization criterion. Nevertheless our use of an efficient clustering algorithm by Teofilo F. Gonzalez, which is optimal with respect to the approximation bound of the clustering problem, has resulted in a fast and effective quantizer. This new quantizer is highly competitive and excels when quantization errors need to be well capped and when the performance of other quantizers may be hindered by such factors as low number of quantized colors or unfavorable pixel population distribution. Both computer-synthesized and photographic images are used in experimental comparison with several existing quantization methods."}
