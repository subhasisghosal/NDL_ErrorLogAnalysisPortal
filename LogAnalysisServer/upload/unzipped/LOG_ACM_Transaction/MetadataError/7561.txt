Good system throughput, however, does not automatically translate to good delay performance for the end users. Neither is fairness guaranteed: Some users may starve, while others hog the system. This paper establishes the conditions for bounded mean queuing delay and nonstarved operation of the slotted Aloha network. We focus on the performance when collisions of packets are resolved using an exponential backoff protocol. For a nonsaturated network, we find that bounded mean delay and nonstarved operation can be guaranteed only if the offered load is limited to below a quantity called \"safe bounded mean-delay (SBMD) throughput.\" The SBMD throughput can be much lower than the saturation system throughput if the backoff factor Ï\u201E in the exponential backoff algorithm is not properly set. For example, it is well known that the maximum throughput of the Aloha network is $e^-1$ = 0.3679. However, for Ï\u201E = 2, a value assumed in many prior investigations, the SBMD throughput is only 0.2158, a drastic penalty of 41% relative to 0.3679. Fortunately, using Ï\u201E = 1.3757 allows us to obtain an SBMD throughput of 0.3545, less than 4% away from 0.3679. A general conclusion is that the system parameters can significantly affect the delay and fairness performance of the Aloha network. This paper provides the analytical framework and expressions for tuning and other system parameters to achieve good delay and nonstarved operation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9930","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9931","fieldValue":"El-Amawy, Ahmed A."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9931","fieldValue":" In this paper, we investigate the problem of all-to-all broadcast in optical networks, also known as gossiping. This problem is very important in the context of control plane design as it relates to status information dissemination. We present a routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) method to reduce the number of wavelengths such that the communication is conflict-free in a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical environment without wavelength converters. Our approach utilizes the tap-and-continue capability of the optical nodes. The network topology is considered to be arbitrary as long as it is connected. Both cases of maximally and nonmaximally edge-connected graphs are studied. For the first case, we give a closed-form expression for the lower bound on the number of wavelengths, which is an elegant extension of the results in 7 for concurrent broadcast trees in optical networks. Furthermore, we show how to achieve this bound. The second case is more involved and requires a specific procedure to achieve the minimum number of wavelengths. For this case, we provide an attractive method for the RWA algorithm that attempts to minimize the number of wavelengths. Our solution for this case is within a constant factor that is strictly less than 2 from the optimal solution. The proposed algorithm uses the concept of \"cactus\" representation of all minimum edge-cuts in a graph in a novel recursive approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9931","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9931","fieldValue":"ACM"}
