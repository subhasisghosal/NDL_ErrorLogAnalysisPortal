We should consider interconnect planning as early as possible. We propose a postfloorplanning step to reduce the interconnect cost of a floorplan by searching alternative packings. If a packing contains a rectangular bounding box of a group of modules, we can rearrange the blocks in the bounding box to obtain a new floorplan with the same area, but possibly with a smaller interconnect cost. Experimental results show that we can reduce the interconnect cost of a packing without any penalty in area."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13056","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13056","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13057","fieldValue":"Wu, Meng-Chiou"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13057","fieldValue":"Lin, Rung-Bin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13057","fieldValue":"Tsai, Shih-Cheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13057","fieldValue":" Chip placement in a reticle is crucial to the cost of a multiproject wafer run. In this article we develop several chip placement methods based on the volume-driven compatibility optimization (VOCO) concept, which maximizes dicing compatibility among chips with large-volume requirements while minimizing reticle dimensions. Our mixed-integer linear programming models with VOCO are too complex to render good solutions for large test cases. Our B&ast;-tree with VOCO and HQ with VOCO use 16&percnt;∼ 29&percnt; fewer wafers and 8&percnt;∼ 19&percnt; less reticle area than the hierarchical quadrisection (HQ) method proposed by Kahng et al.
