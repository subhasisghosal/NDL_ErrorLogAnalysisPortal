We characterize resilience as the percentage of lost traffic upon failures and define scalability as the growth rate of the percentage of lost traffic with respect to network size, link failure probability, and network traffic for given failure protection schemes. We apply probabilistic graphical models to characterize statistical dependence between physical-layer failures and the net-work-layer traffic, and analyze the scalability for large networks of different topologies. We first focus on the scalability of resilience for regular topolo-gies under uniform deterministic traffic with independent and de-pendent link failures, with and without protection. For large net-works with small probabilities of failures and without protection, we show that the scalability of network resilience grows linearly with the average route length and with the \"effective\" link failure probability. For large networks with 1 + 1 protection, we obtain lower and upper bound of the percentage of lost traffic. We de-rive approximations of the scalability for arbitrary topologies, and attain close-form analytical results for ring, star, and mesh-torus topologies. We then study network resilience under random traffic with Poisson arrivals. We find that when the network is under light load, the network resilience is reduced to that under uniform de-terministic traffic. When the network load is under heavy load, the percentage of lost traffic approaches the marginal probability of link failure. Our scalability analysis shows explicitly how network resilience varies with different factors and provides insights for re-silient network design."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9835","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9835","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9835","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9836","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9837","fieldValue":" Colored Trees (CTs) is an efficient approach to route packets along link-or node-disjoint paths in packet-switched networks. In this approach, two trees, namely red and blue, are constructed rooted at a drain such that the path from any node to the drain are link-or node-disjoint. For applications where both the trees are used simultaneously, it is critical to maintain the trees after link or node failures. To this end, this paper develops an algorithm, referred to as SimCT, that efficiently constructs and maintains colored trees under failures using only local informa-tion. Even when the entire tree needs to be recomputed, the SimCT algorithm requires 40% lesser messages than previous techniques. The convergence time of the SimCT algorithm is linear in the number of nodes. We show through extensive simulations that the average length of the disjoint paths obtained using the SimCT algorithm is lesser compared to the previously known techniques. The above-mentioned improvements are obtained by exploiting the relationship between DFS numbering, lowpoint values, and the potentials employed for maintaining partial ordering of nodes. The SimCT algorithm is also extended to obtain colored trees in multi-drain networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9837","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9837","fieldValue":"ACM"}
