However, multicast is not yet widely deployed in the Internet. One reason is the lack of incentive to use multicast delivery. To encourage the use of multicast delivery, we define a new bandwidth-allocation policy, called LogRD, taking into account the number of downstream receivers. This policy gives more bandwidth to a multicast flow as compared to a unicast flow that shares the same bottleneck, without starving the unicast flows, however. The LogRD policy also provides an answer to the question on how to treat a multicast flow compared to a unicast flow sharing the same bottleneck. We investigate three bandwidth-allocation policies for multicast flows and evaluate their impact on both receiver satisfaction and fairness using a simple analytical study and a comprehensive set of simulations. The policy that allocates the available bandwidth as a logarithmic function of the number of receivers downstream of the bottleneck achieves the best tradeoff between receiver satisfaction and fairness."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9066","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9067","fieldValue":" Optimal structured feedback control policies for rate-based flow control of available bit rate service in asynchronous transfer mode networks are obtained in the presence of information and propagation delays, using a numerically efficient two-timescale simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation algorithm. Models comprising both a single bottleneck node and a network with multiple bottleneck nodes are considered. A convergence analysis of the algorithm is presented. Numerical experiments demonstrate fast convergence even in the presence of significant delays. We also illustrate performance comparisons with the well-known Explicit Rate Indication for Congestion Avoidance (ERICA) algorithm and describe another algorithm (based on ERICA) that does not require estimating available bandwidth (as in ERICA)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9067","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9067","fieldValue":"ACM"}
