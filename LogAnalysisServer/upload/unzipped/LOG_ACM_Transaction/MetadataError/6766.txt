In specific, we propose a bootstrapping approach for the extraction of product adopters from review text and categorize them into a number of different demographic categories. The aggregated demographic information of many product adopters can be used to characterize both products and users in the form of distributions over different demographic categories. We further propose a graph-based method to iteratively update user- and product-related distributions more reliably in a heterogeneous user--product graph and incorporate them as features into the matrix factorization approach for product recommendation. Our experimental results on a large dataset crawled from JingDong, the largest B2C e-commerce website in China, show that our proposed framework outperforms a number of competitive baselines for product recommendation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8048","fieldValue":" Decision rules are one of the most expressive and interpretable models for machine learning. In this article, we present Adaptive Model Rules (AMRules), the first stream rule learning algorithm for regression problems. In AMRules, the antecedent of a rule is a conjunction of conditions on the attribute values, and the consequent is a linear combination of the attributes. In order to maintain a regression model compatible with the most recent state of the process generating data, each rule uses a Page-Hinkley test to detect changes in this process and react to changes by pruning the rule set. Online learning might be strongly affected by outliers. AMRules is also equipped with outliers detection mechanisms to avoid model adaption using anomalous examples. In the experimental section, we report the results of AMRules on benchmark regression problems, and compare the performance of our system with other streaming regression algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8048","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8048","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8049","fieldValue":" Traditional process discovery techniques mine process models based upon event traces giving little consideration to workflow relevant data recorded in event logs. The neglect of such information usually leads to incorrect discovered models, especially when activities have decomposable cyclic dependencies. To address this problem, the recorded workflow relevant data and decision tree learning technique are utilized to classify cases into case clusters. Each case cluster contains causality and concurrency activity dependencies only. Then, a set of activity ordering relations are derived based on case clusters. And a synchronization-core-based process model is discovered from the ordering relations and composite cases. Finally, the discovered model is transformed to a BPMN model. The proposed approach is validated with a medical treatment process and an open event log. Meanwhile, a prototype system is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8049","fieldValue":"BPMN"}
