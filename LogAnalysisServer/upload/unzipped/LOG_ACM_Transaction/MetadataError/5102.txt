First, singing\/humming discrimination is performed to distinguish between singing and humming queries, which is achieved by considering the similarity between acoustic models. For the humming queries, a pitch-only melody recognition method that was ranked first among the MIREX (Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange) query-by-singing\/humming task submissions is applied. For the singing queries, a lyric similarity is computed using speech recognition techniques; the computed similarity is subsequently combined with the melody distance to exploit additional information in the lyrics. Several methods for combining melody distance and lyric similarity are investigated. Under the optimal experimental settings, the proposed query-by-singing\/humming system achieves 51.19% error rate reduction for the top-10 retrieved results, indicating the feasibility of the proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3914","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3914","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3915","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art particle filter (PF) system to infer the metrical structure of musical audio signals. The new inference method is designed to overcome the problem of PFs in multi-modal probability distributions, which arise due to tempo and phase ambiguities in musical rhythm representations. We compare the new method with a hidden Markov model (HMM) system and several other PF schemes in terms of performance, speed and scalability on several audio datasets. We demonstrate that using the proposed system the computational complexity can be reduced drastically in comparison to the HMM while maintaining the same order of beat tracking accuracy. Therefore, for the first time, the proposed system allows fast meter inference in a high-dimensional state space, spanned by the three components of tempo, type of rhythm, and position in a metric cycle."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3915","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3915","fieldValue":"ACM"}
