The accuracy of standard simulation algorithms is compromised by unknown or X-values. This results in a pessimistic overestimation of X-valued signals in the circuit and a pessimistic underestimation of fault coverage. This work proposes efficient algorithms for combinational and sequential logic as well as for stuck-at and transition-delay fault simulation that are free of any simulation pessimism in presence of unknowns. The SAT-based algorithms exactly classifiy all signal states. During fault simulation, each fault is accurately classified as either undetected, definitely detected, or possibly detected. The pessimism with respect to unknowns present in classic algorithms is thoroughly investigated in the experimental results on benchmark circuits. The applicability of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on larger industrial circuits. The results show that, by accurate analysis, the number of detected faults can be significantly increased without increasing the test-set size."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13384","fieldValue":"SAT"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13385","fieldValue":" In this article we propose an effective algorithm flow to handle modern large-scale mixed-size placement, both with and without geometry constraints. The basic idea is to use floorplanning to guide the placement of objects at the global level. The flow consists of four steps: (1) The objects in the original netlist are clustered into blocks; (2) floorplanning is performed on the blocks; (3) the blocks are shifted within the chip region to further optimize the wirelength; (4) with large macro-locations fixed, incremental placement is applied to place the remaining objects. There are several advantages to handling placement at the global level with a floorplanning technique. First, the problem size can be significantly reduced. Second, exact Half-Perimeter WireLength (HPWL) can be minimized. Third, better object distribution can be achieved so that legalization only needs to handle minor overlaps among small objects in a block. Fourth, macro-rotation and various geometry constraints can be handled. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new flow, we implement a high-quality and efficient floorplan-guided placer called FLOP. We also construct the Modern Mixed-Size (MMS) placement benchmarks that can effectively represent the complexities of modern mixed-size designs and the challenges faced by modern mixed-size placers. Compared with most state-of-the-art mixed-size placers and leading macroplacers, experimental results show that FLOP achieves the best HPWL and easily obtains legal solutions on all circuits with all geometry constraints satisfied."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13385","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13385","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13386","fieldValue":" The clock distribution network in a synchronous digital circuit delivers a clock signal to every storage element, that is, clock sink in the circuit. However, since the continued technology scaling increases PVT (process-voltage-temperature) variation, the increase of clock-skew variation is highly likely to cause performance degradation or system failure at runtime. Recently, to mitigate the clock-skew variation, many researchers have taken a profound interest in the clock mesh network. However, though the structure of the clock mesh network is excellent in tolerating timing variations, it demands significantly high power consumption due to the use of excessive mesh wire and buffer resources. Thus, optimizing the resources required in the mesh clock synthesis while maintaining the variation tolerance is crucially important. The three major tasks that greatly affect the cost of the resulting clock mesh are: (1) mesh segment allocation, (2) mesh buffer allocation and sizing, and (3) clock sink binding to mesh segments. Previous clock mesh optimization approaches solve the three tasks sequentially, one by one at a time, to manage the runtime complexity of the tasks at the expense of losing the quality of results. However, since the three tasks are tightly interrelated, simultaneously optimizing all three tasks is essential, if the runtime is ever permitted, to synthesize an economical clock mesh network. In this work, we propose an approach that is able to tackle the problem in an integrated fashion by combining the three tasks into an iterative framework of incremental updates and solving them simultaneously to find a globally optimal allocation of mesh resources while taking into account the clock-skew tolerance constraints. The core parts of this work are a precise analysis on the relation among the resource optimization tasks and an establishment of a mechanism for effective and efficient integration of the tasks. In particular, to handle the runtime problem, we propose a set of speedup techniques, that is, modeling the RC circuit for eliminating redundant matrix multiplications, exploiting a sliding-window scheme, and quickly estimating the buffer sizing effect, which are fitted into our context of fast clock-skew estimation in mesh resource optimization as well as an invention of early decision policies. Through extensive experiments with benchmark circuits, it is shown that our proposed clock mesh synthesizer is able to reduce the worst-case clock skew, total mesh wirelength, total size of mesh driving buffers, and total clock mesh power consumption including short-circuit power by 25.0&percnt;, 13.2&percnt;, 10.9&percnt;, and 11.0&percnt; on average compared to that produced by the best-known clock mesh synthesis method (MeshWorks), respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13386","fieldValue":"ACM"}
