We identify beacon density as an important parameter in determining localization quality, which saturates at a transition density. We develop algorithms to improve localization quality by (i) automating placement of new beacons at low densities (HEAP) and (ii) rotating functionality among redundant beacons while increasing system lifetime at high densities (STROBE)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6221","fieldValue":" The effectiveness of cluster-based distributed sensor networks depends to a large extent on the coverage provided by the sensor deployment. We propose a virtual force algorithm (VFA) as a sensor deployment strategy to enhance the coverage after an initial random placement of sensors. For a given number of sensors, the VFA algorithm attempts to maximize the sensor field coverage. A judicious combination of attractive and repulsive forces is used to determine the new sensor locations that improve the coverage. Once the effective sensor positions are identified, a one-time movement with energy consideration incorporated is carried out, that is, the sensors are redeployed, to these positions. We also propose a novel probabilistic target localization algorithm that is executed by the cluster head. The localization results are used by the cluster head to query only a few sensors (out of those that report the presence of a target) for more detailed information. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6221","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6221","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6222","fieldValue":" Embedded wireless devices require secure high-performance cryptography in addition to low-cost and low-energy dissipation. This paper presents for the first time a design methodology for security on a VLIW complex DSP-embedded processor core. Elliptic curve cryptography is used to demonstrate the design for security methodology. Results are verified with real dynamic power measurements and show that compared to previous research a 79&percnt; improvement in performance is achieved. Modification of power traces are performed to resist simple power analysis attack with up to 39&percnt; overhead in performance, up to 49&percnt; overheads in energy dissipation, and up to 11&percnt; overhead in code size. Simple power analysis on the VLIW DSP core is shown to be more correlated to routine ordering than individual instructions. For the first time, differential power analysis results on a VLIW using real power measurements are presented. Results show that the processor instruction level parallelism and large bus size contribute in making differential power analysis attacks extremely difficult. This research is important for industry since efficient yet secure cryptography is crucial for wireless communication devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6222","fieldValue":"VLIW"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6222","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6222","fieldValue":"ACM"}
