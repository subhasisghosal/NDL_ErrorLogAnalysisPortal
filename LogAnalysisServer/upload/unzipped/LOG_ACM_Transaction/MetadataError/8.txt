It is known that any algorithm that comes within ε of the minimum average power required for queue stability must incur average queue size at least Ωlog1\/ε. However, the optimal convergence time is unknown. This paper develops a scheduling algorithm that, for any ε > 0, achieves the optimal Olog1\/ε average queue size tradeoff with a convergence time of Olog1\/ε\/ε. An example system is presented for which all algorithms require convergence time at least Ω1\/ε, and so the proposed algorithm is within a logarithmic factor of the optimal convergence time. The method uses the simple drift-plus-penalty technique with an improved convergence time analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11007","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11008","fieldValue":"Longbo Huang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11008","fieldValue":"Shaoquan Zhang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11008","fieldValue":"Minghua Chen"}
