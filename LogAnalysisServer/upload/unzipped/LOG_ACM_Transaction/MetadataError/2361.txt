Even though their use is well established in industry, generating ray-traced images adds significant cost in time and memory consumption. Ray tracing such surfaces is usually accomplished by subdividing the surfaces on the fly, or by conversion to a polygonal representation. However, on-the-fly subdivision is computationally very expensive, whereas polygonal meshes require large amounts of memory. This is a particular problem for parametric surfaces with displacement, where very fine tessellation is required to faithfully represent the shape. Hence, memory restrictions are the major challenge in production rendering. In this article, we present a novel solution to this problem. We propose a compression scheme for a priori Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVHs) on parametric patches, that reduces the data required for the hierarchy by a factor of up to 48. We further propose an approximate evaluation method that does not require leaf geometry, yielding an overall reduction of memory consumption by a factor of 60 over regular BVHs on indexed face sets and by a factor of 16 over established state-of-the-art compression schemes. Alternatively, our compression can simply be applied to a standard BVH while keeping the leaf geometry, resulting in a compression rate of up to 2:1 over current methods. Although decompression generates additional costs during traversal, we can manage very complex scenes even on the memory restrictive GPU at competitive render times."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17752","fieldValue":" A major goal of research on virtual humans is the animation of expressive characters that display distinct psychological attributes. Body motion is an effective way of portraying different personalities and differentiating characters. The purpose and contribution of this work is to describe a formal, broadly applicable, procedural, and empirically grounded association between personality and body motion and apply this association to modify a given virtual human body animation that can be represented by these formal concepts. Because the body movement of virtual characters may involve different choices of parameter sets depending on the context, situation, or application, formulating a link from personality to body motion requires an intermediate step to assist generalization. For this intermediate step, we refer to Laban Movement Analysis, which is a movement analysis technique for systematically describing and evaluating human motion. We have developed an expressive human motion generation system with the help of movement experts and conducted a user study to explore how the psychologically validated OCEAN personality factors were perceived in motions with various Laban parameters. We have then applied our findings to procedurally animate expressive characters with personality, and validated the generalizability of our approach across different models and animations via another perception study."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17752","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA (Neff, Michael); University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA (Badler, Norman I.); Drexel University (Deutsch, Susan); University of Pennsylvania and Oregon Health &#x38; Science University, Portland, OR, USA (Durupinar, Funda); Rutgers University, NJ, USA (Kapadia, Mubbasir)"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17752","fieldValue":"PERFORM: Perceptual Approach for Adding OCEAN Personality to Human Motion Using Laban Movement Analysis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17753","fieldValue":"Lien, Jyh-Ming"}
