Pathway-based drug discovery recently emerged as an appealing approach to overcome this limitation. An important first step of such pathway-based drug discovery is to identify associations between drug molecules and biological pathways. This task has been made feasible by the accumulating data from high-throughput transcription and drug sensitivity profiling. In this paper, we developed \"iPaD\", an method to identify drug-pathway associations through jointly modeling of such high-throughput transcription and drug sensitivity data. A scalable bi-convex optimization algorithm was implemented and gave iPaD tremendous advantage in computational efficiency over current state-of-the-art method, which allows it to handle the ever-growing large-scale data sets that current method cannot afford to. On two widely used real data sets, iPaD also significantly outperformed the current method in terms of the number of validated drug-pathway associations that were identified.

The flagellin protofilaments contain 11-helix dual turn structure in a single flagellum. Each flagellin consists of four sub-domains - two inner domains (D0, D1) and two outer domains (D2, D3). While inner domains predominantly consist of Î±-helices, the outer domains are primarily beta sheets with D3. In flagellum, the outermost sub-domain is the only one that is exposed to the native environment. This study focuses on the interactions of the residues of D3 of an R-type flagellin with 5nm long chiral (5, 15) and arm-chair (12, 12) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) using molecular dynamics simulation. It presents the interactive forces between the SWNT and the residues of D3 from the perspectives of size and chirality of the SWNT. It is found that the metallic (arm-chair) SWNT interacts the most with glycine and threonine residues through van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions, whereas the semiconducting (chiral) SWNT interacts largely with the area of protein devoid of glycine by van der Waals, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. This indicates a crucial role that glycine plays in distinguishing metallic from semiconducting SWNTs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5329","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5329","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5329","fieldValue":"ACM"}
