Heuristic-based approaches are typically used to handle such NP-complete problems of global routing in 3D ICs. To overcome the inherent limitations of deterministic approaches, a novel methodology for multi-objective global routing based on fuzzy logic has been proposed in this article. The guiding information generated after the placement phase is used during routing with the help of a fuzzy expert system to achieve thermally efficient and congestion-free routing. A complete global routing solution is designed based on the proposed algorithms and the results are compared with selected fully established global routers, namely Labyrinth, FastRoute3.0, NTHU-R, BoxRouter 2.0, FGR, NTHU-Route2.0, FastRoute4.0, NCTU-GR, MGR, and NCTU-GR2.0. Experiments are performed over ISPD 1998 and 2008 benchmarks. The proposed router, called FuzzRoute, achieves balanced superiority in terms of routability, runtime, and wirelength over others. The improvements on routing time for Labyrinth, BoxRouter 2.0, and FGR are 91.81&percnt;, 86.87&percnt;, and 32.16&percnt;, respectively, for ISPD 1998 benchmarks. It may be noted that, though FastRoute3.0 achieves fastest runtime, it fails to generate congestion-free solutions for all benchmarks, which is overcome by the proposed FuzzRoute of the current article. It also shows wirelength improvements of 17.35&percnt;, 2.88&percnt;, 2.44&percnt;, 2.83&percnt;, and 2.10&percnt;, respectively, over others for ISPD 1998 benchmarks. For ISPD 2008 benchmark circuits it also provides 2.5&percnt;, 2.6&percnt;, 1 &percnt;, 1.1&percnt;, and 0.3&percnt; lesser wirelength and averagely runs 1.68Ã\u2014, 6.42Ã\u2014, 2.21Ã\u2014, 0.76Ã\u2014, and 1.54Ã\u2014 faster than NTHU-Route2.0, FastRoute4.0, NCTU-GR, MGR, and NCTU-GR2.0, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13464","fieldValue":"FuzzRoute: A Thermally Efficient Congestion-Free Global Routing Method for Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13464","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13464","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13465","fieldValue":"Luk, Wai-Shing"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13465","fieldValue":" In this article we present a pairwise coloring (PWC) approach to tackle the layout decomposition problem for triple patterning lithography (TPL). The main idea is to reduce the problem to a set of bi-coloring problems. The overall solution is refined by applying a bi-coloring method for pairs of color sets per pass. One obvious advantage of this method is that the existing double patterning lithography (DPL) techniques can be reused effortlessly. Moreover, we observe that each pass can be fulfilled efficiently by integrating an SPQR-tree-graph-division-based bi-coloring method. In addition, to prevent the solution getting stuck in the local minima, an adaptive multi-start (AMS) approach is incorporated. Adaptive starting points are generated according to the vote of previous solutions. The experimental results show that our method is competitive with other works on both solution quality and runtime performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13465","fieldValue":"Layout Decomposition with Pairwise Coloring and Adaptive Multi-Start for Triple Patterning Lithography"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13465","fieldValue":"ACM"}
