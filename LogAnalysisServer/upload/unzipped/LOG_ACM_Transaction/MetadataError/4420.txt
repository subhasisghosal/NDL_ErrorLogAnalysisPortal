In particular, we investigate the number of result pages that search engines should prepare during the query processing phase.Search engine users have been observed to browse through very few pages of results for queries that they submit. This behavior of users suggests that prefetching many results upon processing an initial query is not efficient, since most of the prefetched results will not be requested by the user who initiated the search. However, a policy that abandons result prefetching in favor of retrieving just the first page of search results might not make optimal use of system resources either.We argue that for a certain behavior of users, engines should prefetch a constant number of result pages per query. We define a concrete query processing model for search engines with segmented indices, and analyze the cost of such prefetching policies. Based on these costs, we show how to determine the constant that optimizes the prefetching policy. Our results are mostly applicable to local index partitions of the inverted files, but are also applicable to processing short queries in global index architectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24298","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24298","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24299","fieldValue":" We present a new approach for fine-grained control over users' security privileges (fast revocation of credentials) centered around the concept of an on-line semi-trusted mediator (SEM). The use of a SEM in conjunction with a simple threshold variant of the RSA cryptosystem (mediated RSA) offers a number of practical advantages over current revocation techniques. The benefits include simplified validation of digital signatures, efficient certificate revocation for legacy systems and fast revocation of signature and decryption capabilities. This paper discusses both the architecture and the implementation of our approach as well as its performance and compatibility with the existing infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate its practical aspects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24300","fieldValue":" An open (in the sense of extensible and programmable) architecture for IP telecommunications must be based on a comprehensive strategy for managing feature interaction.
