Using this approach, the reconstruction error based on NMF is represented by a Poisson distribution, and the NMF parameters, consisting of the basis and weight matrices, are characterized by the exponential priors. A variational Bayesian inference procedure is developed to learn variational parameters and model parameters. The randomness in separation process is faithfully represented so that the system robustness to model variations in heterogeneous environments could be achieved. Importantly, the exponential prior parameters are used to impose sparseness in basis representation. The variational lower bound of log marginal likelihood is adopted as the objective to control model complexity. The dependencies of variational objective on model parameters are fully characterized in the derived closed-form solution. A clustering algorithm is performed to find the groups of bases for unsupervised source separation. The experiments on speech\/music separation and singing voice separation show that the proposed Bayesian NMF (BNMF) with adaptive basis representation outperforms the NMF with fixed number of bases and the other BNMFs in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio and the global normalized source to distortion ratio."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3975","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3975","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3976","fieldValue":" Spherical microphone arrays facilitate three-dimensional processing and analysis of sound fields in applications such as music recording, beamforming and room acoustics. The frequency bandwidth of operation is constrained by the array configuration. At high frequencies, spatial aliasing leads to side-lobes in the array beam pattern, which limits array performance. Previous studies proposed increasing the number of microphones or changing other characteristics of the array configuration to reduce the effect of aliasing. In this paper we present a method to design beamformers that overcome the effect of spatial aliasing by suppressing the undesired side-lobes through signal processing without physically modifying the configuration of the array. This is achieved by modeling the expected aliasing pattern in a maximum-directivity beamformer design, leading to a higher directivity index at frequencies previously considered to be out of the operating bandwidth, thereby extending the microphone array frequency range of operation. Aliasing cancellation is then extended to other beamformers. A simulation example with a 32-element spherical microphone array illustrates the performance of the proposed method. An experimental example validates the theoretical results in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3976","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3976","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1304","fieldValue":" In this article, we present property-driven design, a novel top-down design method for robot swarms based on prescriptive modeling and model checking. Traditionally, robot swarms have been developed using a code-and-fix approach: in a bottom-up iterative process, the developer tests and improves the individual behaviors of the robots until the desired collective behavior is obtained. The code-and-fix approach is unstructured, and the quality of the obtained swarm depends completely on the expertise and ingenuity of the developer who has little scientific or technical support in his activity. Property-driven design aims at providing such scientific and technical support, with many advantages compared to the traditional unstructured approach. Property-driven design is composed of four phases: first, the developer formally specifies the requirements of the robot swarm by stating its desired properties; second, the developer creates a prescriptive model of the swarm and uses model checking to verify that this prescriptive model satisfies the desired properties; third, using the prescriptive model as a blueprint, the developer implements a simulated version of the desired robot swarm and validates the prescriptive model developed in the previous step; fourth, the developer implements the desired robot swarm and validates the previous steps. We demonstrate property-driven design using two case studies: aggregation and foraging."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1304","fieldValue":"Property-Driven Design for Robot Swarms: A Design Method Based on Prescriptive Modeling and Model Checking"}
