However, their delay performance still remains unsatisfactory, mainly due to the nature of the underlying Markov chains that imposes a fundamental constraint on how the link state can evolve over time. In this paper, we propose a new approach toward better queueing delay performance, based on our observation that the algorithm needs not be Markovian, as long as it can be implemented in a distributed manner. Our approach hinges upon utilizing past state information observed by local link and then constructing a high-order Markov chain for the evolution of the feasible link schedules. We show that our proposed algorithm, named delayed CSMA, achieves the throughput optimality, and also provides much better delay performance by effectively â\u20ACœdecorrelatingâ\u20AC? the link state process and thus resolves link starvation. Our simulation results demonstrate that the delay under our algorithm can be reduced by a factor of 20 in some cases, compared to the standard Glauber-dynamics-based CSMA algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11011","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh (Kwak, Jaewook; Eun, Do Young); Dept. of Electr. &amp; Comput.

IPv6 offered an early solution to a well-understood and well-documented problem IPv4 was expected to encounter. In spite of early standardization and awareness of the issue, the Internet's march to IPv6 has been anything but smooth, even if recent data point to an improvement. This paper documents this progression for several key Internet stakeholders using available measurement data, and identifies changes in the IPv6 ecosystem that may be in part responsible for how it has unfolded. The paper also develops a stylized model of IPv6 adoption across those stakeholders, and validates its qualitative predictive ability by comparing it to measurement data."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11012","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: ESE, University of Pennsylvania (Nikkhah, Mehdi); Dept. of Comput.
