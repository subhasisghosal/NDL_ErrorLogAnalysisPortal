The storage and transmission of multimedia big data have high requirements for security. Images, covering the highest proportion of multimedia data, should be processed and transmitted with high security. Compressive sensing (CS) has a beneficial property for the encryption that the image can be recovered with fewer samples than conventional approaches use. In recent years, CS has been studied not only to reduce the resource requirements for signal acquisition but also to ensure the security of data. It is still an open challenge to improve security and enhance the quality of the decrypted image simultaneously using the key with small size. In this article, a CS-based encryption method is presented that associates the quantization with random measurement permutation. An enormous number of experiments have been conducted on both standard test images and face images chosen from the big database LFW. Experimental results show that our proposal has dramatic improvements on ensuring the security, enhancing the quality of the decrypted image, and raising the efficiency. Additionally, this proposal remarkably reduces storage and transmission resources. Accordingly, this encryption scheme can be applied to ensure the security of multimedia transmission."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25761","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25761","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25762","fieldValue":" The reliability and security of multimedia contents in transmission, communications, storage, and usage have attracted special attention. Robust image hashing, also referred to as perceptual image hashing, is widely applied in multimedia authentication and forensics, image retrieval, image indexing, and digital image watermarking. In this work, a novel robust image hashing method based on quaternion Zernike moments (QZMs) is proposed. QZMs offer a sound way to jointly deal with the three channels of color images without discarding chrominance information; the generated hash is thus shorter than the hash of three channels separately processing. The proposed approach's performance was evaluated on the color images database of UCID and compared with several recent and efficient methods. These experiments show that the proposed scheme provides a short hash in length that is robust to most common image content-preserving manipulations like JPEG compression, filtering, noise, scaling, and large angle rotation operations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25763","fieldValue":" H.264\/SVC (Scalable Video Coding) codestreams, which consist of a single base layer and multiple enhancement layers, are designed for quality, spatial, and temporal scalabilities. They can be transmitted over networks of different bandwidths and seamlessly accessed by various terminal devices. With a huge amount of video surveillance and various devices becoming an integral part of the security infrastructure, the industry is currently starting to use the SVC standard to process digital video for surveillance applications such that clients with different network bandwidth connections and display capabilities can seamlessly access various SVC surveillance (sub)codestreams. In order to guarantee the trustworthiness and integrity of received SVC codestreams, engineers and researchers have proposed several authentication schemes to protect video data. However, existing algorithms cannot simultaneously satisfy both efficiency and robustness for SVC surveillance codestreams. Hence, in this article, a highly efficient and robust authentication scheme, named TrustSSV (Trust Scalable Surveillance Video), is proposed. Based on quality\/spatial scalable characteristics of SVC codestreams, TrustSSV combines cryptographic and content-based authentication techniques to authenticate the base layer and enhancement layers, respectively. Based on temporal scalable characteristics of surveillance codestreams, TrustSSV extracts, updates, and authenticates foreground features for each access unit dynamically with background model support. Using SVC test sequences, our experimental results indicate that the scheme is able to distinguish between content-preserving and content-changing manipulations and to pinpoint tampered locations. Compared with existing schemes, the proposed scheme incurs very small computation and communication costs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25763","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25763","fieldValue":"ACM"}
