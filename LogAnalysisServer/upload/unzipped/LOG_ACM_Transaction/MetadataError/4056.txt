In our study, individual students engage in spoken dialogs with the virtual tutor Marni during 15 to 20 minute sessions following classroom science investigations to discuss and extend concepts embedded in the investigations. The spoken dialogs in MyST are designed to scaffold learning by presenting open-ended questions accompanied by illustrations or animations related to the classroom investigations and the science concepts being learned. The focus of the interactions is to elicit self-expression from students. To this end, Marni applies some of the principles of Questioning the Author, a proven approach to classroom conversations, to challenge students to think about and integrate new concepts with prior knowledge to construct enriched mental models that can be used to explain and predict scientific phenomena. In this article, we describe how spoken dialogs using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and natural language processing were developed to stimulate students' thinking, reasoning and self explanations. We describe the MyST system architecture and Wizard of Oz procedure that was used to collect data from tutorial sessions with elementary school students. Using data collected with the procedure, we present evaluations of the ASR and semantic parsing components. A formal evaluation of learning gains resulting from system use is currently being conducted. This paper presents survey results of teachers' and children's impressions of MyST."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23066","fieldValue":" This article examines the use of statistically discovered morpheme-like units for Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR). The morpheme-like units (morphs) are used both for language modeling in speech recognition and as index terms. Traditional word-based methods suffer from out-of-vocabulary words. If a word is not in the recognizer vocabulary, any occurrence of the word in speech will be missing from the transcripts. The problem is especially severe for languages with a high number of distinct word forms such as Finnish. With the morph language model, even previously unseen words can be recognized by identifying its component morphs. Similarly in information retrieval queries, complex word forms, even unseen ones, can be matched to data after segmenting them to morphs. Retrieval performance can be further improved by expanding the transcripts with alternative recognition results from confusion networks. In this article, a novel retrieval evaluation corpus consisting of unsegmented Finnish radio programs, 25 queries and corresponding human relevance assessments was constructed. Previous results on using morphs and confusion networks for Finnish SDR are confirmed and extended to the unsegmented case. As previously, using morphs or base forms as index terms yields about equal performance but combination methods, including a new one, are found to work better than either alone. Using alternative morph segmentations of the query words is found to further improve the results. Lexical similarity-based story segmentation was applied and performance using morphs, base forms, and their combinations was compared for the first time."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23066","fieldValue":"Speech retrieval from unsegmented finnish audio using statistical morpheme-like units for segmentation, recognition, and retrieval"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23067","fieldValue":" In this article, we explore the task of automatically identifying educational materials by classifying documents with respect to their educational value. Through experiments carried out on a dataset of manually annotated documents, we show that the generally accepted notion of a learning object's â\u20ACœeducational valueâ\u20AC? is indeed a property that can be reliably assigned through automatic classification. Moreover, an analysis of cross-topic and cross-domain portability shows that the automatic classifier can be ported to other topics and domains, with minimal performance loss."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23067","fieldValue":"ACM"}
