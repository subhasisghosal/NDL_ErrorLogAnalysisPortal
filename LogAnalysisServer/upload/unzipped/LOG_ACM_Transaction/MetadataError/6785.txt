It has many achievements and extensive research to its credit and has established a large group of researchers and experts worldwide. The field has changed and changed and changed again over the last half century. The question addressed in this inaugural issue article is: Where does IS go from here&quest; This article presents the views of six of the â\u20ACœfathers of the fieldâ\u20AC? about its directions in the years ahead. Each coauthor presents two ideas about the future. The topics covered includes continuing support of the work of organizations, emerging technologies, new ways of communicating, expanding the ways IS performs research, expanding its vision both of what IS is and of its impact, its role as a resource, its model of the IS professional and its graduates, and its staying on top of new technologies and new areas of inquiry."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8130","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8130","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8131","fieldValue":" More and more people use search engines to seek for various information. This study investigates the search behavior that drives the search for information security knowledge via a search engine. Based on theories in information search and information security behavior we examine the effects of network attacks and vulnerability disclosures on search for information security knowledge by ordinary users. We construct a unique dataset from publicly available sources, and use a dynamic regression model to test the hypotheses empirically. We find that network attacks of current day and one day prior significantly impact the search, while vulnerability disclosure does not significantly affect the search. Implications of the study are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8131","fieldValue":"Drivers of information security search behavior: An investigation of network attacks and vulnerability disclosures"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8131","fieldValue":"ACM"}
