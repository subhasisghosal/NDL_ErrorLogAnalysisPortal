It is an extended version of the existing HPM model which contains 12 sub-models to describe various relationships of prosodic-acoustic features of speech signal, linguistic features of the associated text, and prosodic tags representing the prosodic structure of speech. Two main modifications are suggested. One is designing proper normalization functions from the statistics of the whole database to compensate the influences of speaking rate on all prosodic-acoustic features. Another is modifying the HPM training to let its parameters be speaking-rate dependent. Experimental results on a large Mandarin read speech corpus showed that the parameters of the SR-HPM together with these feature normalization functions interpreted the effects of speaking rate onMandarin speech prosody very well. An application of the SR-HPM to design and implement a speaking rate-controlled Mandarin TTS system is demonstrated. The system can generate natural synthetic speech for any given speaking rate in awide range of 3.4-6.8 syllables\/sec. Two subjective tests, MOS and preference test, were conducted to compare the proposed system with the popular HTS system. The MOS scores of the proposed system were in the range of 3.58-3.83 for eight different speaking rates, while they were in 3.09-3.43 for HTS. Besides, the proposed system had higher preference scores (49.8%-79.6%) than those (9.8%-30.7%) of HTS. This confirmed the effectiveness of the speaking rate control method of the proposed TTS system."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3671","fieldValue":"Modeling of speaking rate influences on mandarin speech prosody and its application to speaking rate-controlled TTS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3672","fieldValue":"Azpicueta-Ruiz, Luis A."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3672","fieldValue":"Arenas-Garca, Jernimo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3672","fieldValue":" Recently, a new class of nonlinear adaptive filtering architectures has been introduced based on the functional link adaptive filter (FLAF) model. Here we focus specifically on the split FLAF (SFLAF) architecture, which separates the adaptation of linear and nonlinear coefficients using two different adaptive filters in parallel. This property makes the SFLAF a well-suited method for problems like nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation (NAEC), in which the separation of filtering tasks brings some performance improvement. Although flexibility is one of the main features of the SFLAF, some problem may occur when the nonlinearity degree of the input signal is not known a priori. This implies a non-optimal choice of the number of coefficients to be adapted in the nonlinear path of the SFLAF. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a proportionate FLAF (PFLAF), which is based on sparse representations of functional links, thus giving less importance to those coefficients that do not actively contribute to the nonlinear modeling. Experimental results show that the proposed PFLAF achieves performance improvement with respect to the SFLAF in several nonlinear scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3672","fieldValue":"ACM"}
