Such epidemic-style strategies are based on random sampling of target hosts according to a sampling rule. In this paper, we consider the metric of total number of samplings (equivalently probes) to reach a given target fraction of the host population. We first identify the minimum number of samplings needed to reach a target fraction of hosts, assuming global information about the host distribution over subnets is available. We show that this optimum can be achieved either by a dynamic strategy, for which the sampling probabilities over subnets are allowed to vary over time, or, surprisingly, even by a static strategy, for which the sampling probabilities over subnets are fixed. These results provide insights about the best achievable performance and how different system parameters affect the number of sampling needed. We then consider simple online sampling strategies that do not require any prior knowledge of the distribution of hosts over subnets, but where each host biases sampling based on its observed sampling outcomes while keeping only O(1) state at any point in time. Using real data-sets from several large-scale Internet measurements, we evaluate significance of the system parameters that determine the sampling requirements and compare the performance of our proposed distribution-oblivious sampling strategies to the theoretical bound. Our results provide insights for the design of efficient information dissemination systems, as well as for the design of countermeasures against worms that use subnet-preferential scanning."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10037","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10037","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10037","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10038","fieldValue":" TCP throughput prediction is an important capability for networks where multiple paths exist between data senders and receivers. In this paper, we describe a new lightweight method for TCP throughput prediction. Our predictor uses Support Vector Regression (SVR); prediction is based on both prior file transfer history and measurements of simple path properties. We evaluate our predictor in a laboratory setting where ground truth can be measured with perfect accuracy. We report the performance of our predictor for oracular and practical measurements of path properties over a wide range of traffic conditions and transfer sizes. For bulk transfers in heavy traffic using oracular measurements, TCP throughput is predicted within 10% of the actual value 87% of the time, representing nearly a threefold improvement in accuracy over prior history-based methods. For practical measurements of path properties, predictions can be made within 10% of the actual value nearly 50% of the time, approximately a 60% improvement over history-based methods, and with much lower measurement traffic overhead. We implement our predictor in a tool called Path-Perf, test it in the wide area, and show that PathPerf predicts TCP throughput accurately over diverse wide area paths."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10038","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
