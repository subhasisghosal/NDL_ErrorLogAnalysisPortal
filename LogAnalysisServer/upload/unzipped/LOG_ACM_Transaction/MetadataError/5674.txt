Multi-label learning is widely used to predict functions of proteins. Most of multi-label learning methods make prediction for unlabeled proteins under the assumption that the labeled proteins are completely annotated, i.e., without any missing functions. However, in practice, we may have a subset of the ground-truth functions for a protein, and whether the protein has other functions is unknown. To predict protein functions with incomplete annotations, we propose a Protein Function Prediction method with Weak-label Learning (ProWL) and its variant ProWL-IF. Both ProWL and ProWL-IF can replenish the missing functions of proteins. In addition, ProWL-IF makes use of the knowledge that a protein cannot have certain functions, which can further boost the performance of protein function prediction. Our experimental results on protein-protein interaction networks and gene expression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both ProWL and ProWL-IF."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5066","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5067","fieldValue":"Lpez-Caamal, Fernando"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5067","fieldValue":" Calcium ions act as messengers in a broad range of processes such as learning, apoptosis, and muscular movement. The transient profile and the temporal accumulation of calcium signals have been suggested as the two main characteristics in which calcium cues encode messages to be forwarded to downstream pathways. We address the analytical quantification of calcium temporal-accumulation in a long, thin section of a nonexcitable cell by solving a boundary value problem. In these expressions we note that the cytosolic $Ca^2+ accumulation is independent of every intracellular calcium flux and depends on the Ca2+ exchange across the membrane, cytosolic calcium diffusion, geometry of the cell, extracellular calcium perturbation, and initial concentrations. In particular, we analyse the time-integrated response of cytosolic calcium due to i) a localised initial concentration of cytosolic calcium and ii) transient extracellular perturbation of calcium. In these scenarios, we conclude that i) the range of calcium progression is confined to the vicinity of the initial concentration, thereby creating calcium microdomains; and ii) we observe a low-pass filtering effect in the response driven by extracellular Ca2+$ perturbations. Additionally, we note that our methodology can be used to analyse a broader range of stimuli and scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5067","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/5067","fieldValue":"Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> microdomains"}
