An important part of this analysis is to determine the key patterns of flow in the underlying network. Almost all the work in this area has focused on fixed models of the network structure, and edge-based transmission between nodes. In this article, we propose a fully content-centered model of flow analysis in networks, in which the analysis is based on actual content transmissions in the underlying social stream, rather than a static model of transmission on the edges. First, we introduce the problem of influence analysis in the context of information flow in networks. We then propose a novel algorithm InFlowMine to discover the information flow patterns in the network and demonstrate the effectiveness of the discovered information flows using an influence mining application. This application illustrates the flexibility and effectiveness of our information flow model to find topic- or network-specific influencers, or their combinations. We empirically show that our information flow mining approach is effective and efficient than the existing methods on a number of different measures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8045","fieldValue":" In this work, we introduce a novel definition of outlier, namely the Gradient Outlier Factor (or GOF), with the aim to provide a definition that unifies with the statistical one on some standard distributions but has a different behavior in the presence of mixture distributions. Intuitively, the GOF score measures the probability to stay in the neighborhood of a certain object. It is directly proportional to the density and inversely proportional to the variation of the density. We derive formal properties under which the GOF definition unifies the statistical outlier definition and show that the unification holds for some standard distributions, while the GOF is able to capture tails in the presence of different distributions even if their densities sensibly differ. Moreover, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of the GOF score, by means of the notion of density of the data density. Experimental results confirm that there are scenarios in which the novel definition can be profitably employed. To the best of our knowledge, except for distance-based outlier, no other data mining outlier definition has a so clearly established relationship with statistical outliers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8046","fieldValue":" How much has a network changed since yesterday? How different is the wiring of Bobâ\u20AC™s brain (a left-handed male) and Aliceâ\u20AC™s brain (a right-handed female), and how is it different? Graph similarity with given node correspondence, i.e., the detection of changes in the connectivity of graphs, arises in numerous settings. In this work, we formally state the axioms and desired properties of the graph similarity functions, and evaluate when state-of-the-art methods fail to detect crucial connectivity changes in graphs. We propose DeltaCon, a principled, intuitive, and scalable algorithm that assesses the similarity between two graphs on the same nodes (e.g., employees of a company, customers of a mobile carrier). In conjunction, we propose DeltaCon-Attr, a related approach that enables attribution of change or dissimilarity to responsible nodes and edges. Experiments on various synthetic and real graphs showcase the advantages of our method over existing similarity measures. Finally, we employ DeltaCon and DeltaCon-Attr on real applications: (a) we classify people to groups of high and low creativity based on their brain connectivity graphs, (b) do temporal anomaly detection in the who-emails-whom Enron graph and find the top culprits for the changes in the temporal corporate email graph, and (c) recover pairs of test-retest large brain scans ( âˆ¼17M edges, up to 90M edges) for 21 subjects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8046","fieldValue":"ACM"}
