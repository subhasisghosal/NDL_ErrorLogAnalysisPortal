It takes advantage of recent technology advances in both linguistics and acoustics based modeling techniques in automatic speech recognition (ASR) while overcoming the issue of a lack of a large set of transcribed data often required in designing state-of-the-art ASR systems. The key idea lies in defining a common set of fundamental units \"universally\" across all spoken accents such that any given spoken utterance can be transcribed with this set of \"accent-universal\" units. In this study, we adopt a set of units describing manner and place of articulation as speech attributes. These units exist in most spoken languages and they can be reliably modeled and extracted to represent foreign accent cues. We also propose an i-vector representation strategy to model the feature streams formed by concatenating these units. Testing on both the Finnish national foreign language certificate (FSD) corpus and the English NIST 2008 SRE corpus, the experimental results with the proposed approach demonstrate a significant system performance improvement with p-value < 0.05 over those with the conventional spectrum-based techniques. We observed up to a 15% relative error reduction over the already very strong i-vector accented recognition system when only manner information is used. Additional improvement is obtained by adding place of articulation clues along with context information. Furthermore, diagnostic information provided by the proposed approach can be useful to the designers to further enhance the system performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3962","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3962","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3963","fieldValue":" Linear prediction is one of the most established techniques in signal estimation, and it is widely utilized in speech signal processing. It has been long understood that the nerve firing rate of human auditory system can be approximated by power law nonlinearity, and this has been the motivation behind using perceptual linear prediction in extracting acoustic features in a variety of speech processing applications. In this paper, we revisit the application of power law non-linearity in speech spectrum estimation by compressing\/expanding power spectrum in autocorrelation-based linear prediction. The development of so-called LP-Î± is motivated by a desire to obtain spectral features that present less mismatch than conventionally used spectrum estimation methods when speech of normal loudness is compared to speech under vocal effort. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a speaker recognition task conducted under severe vocal effort mismatch comparing shouted versus normal speech mode."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3963","fieldValue":"Feature extraction using power-law adjusted linear prediction with application to speaker recognition under severe vocal effort mismatch"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3963","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3963","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3964","fieldValue":" This paper recasts the problem of online secondary path modeling in the form of a statistical inverse problem. A statistical and, in particular, a Bayesian approach towards secondary path modeling is developed and the computational issues that emerge from this approach are discussed. All signals and parameters are modeled as random variables and the degree of information concerning them is coded in their probability density functions. An abstract solution is formulated in the form of a probability density function for the secondary path model. For extracting point estimates, common statistical estimation methods are investigated. It is shown that maximum likelihood estimation is not stable; however, Bayesian method of maximum a posteriori gives a reliable solution. An adaptive algorithm is then developed to compute this solution in a computationally efficient manner. This algorithm has three advantages, compared to the traditional secondary path modeling algorithms. First, it does not cause any interference with the main active noise control algorithm. Second, it does not require any additive-noise to be injected into the secondary path. Third, it does not require any off-line initiation. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is analyzed theoretically. The validity of the theoretical results is investigated by using computer simulation. Finally successful integration of the proposed algorithm into a real-time ANC system is reported."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3964","fieldValue":"ACM"}
