Using the collocation-based statistical modeling technique, first, the statistical interpolation polynomial for on-chip temperature distribution can be obtained by performing deterministic electrothermal simulation very few times and by utilizing polynomial interpolation. After that, the proposed simulator not only provides the mean and standard deviation profiles of on-chip temperature distribution, but also innovates the concept of thermal yield profile to statistically characterize the on-chip temperature distribution more precisely, and builds an efficient technique for estimating this figure of merit. Moreover, a mixed-mesh strategy is presented to further enhance the efficiency of the developed statistical electrothermal simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that (1) the developed statistical electrothermal simulator can obtain accurate approximations with orders of magnitude speedup over the Monte Carlo method; (2) comparing with a well-known cumulative distribution function estimation method, APEX [Li et al. 2004], the developed statistical electrothermal simulator can achieve 215Ã\u2014 speedup with better accuracy; (3) the developed mixed-mesh strategy can achieve an order of magnitude faster over our baseline algorithm and still maintain an acceptable accuracy level."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13335","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13335","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13336","fieldValue":" Although order statistics have been studied for several decades, most of the results are based on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. In the literature, how to compute the mth order statistics of n correlated random variables is still a problem. This article proposes a recursive algorithm based on statistical min\/max operations to compute order statistics for general correlated and not necessarily identically distributed random variables. The algorithm has an O(mn) time complexity and O(m &plus; n) space complexity. A binary tree-based data structure is further developed to allow selective update of the order statistics with $O(nm^2$) time. As a vehicle to demonstrate the algorithm, we apply it to the path selection algorithm in at-speed testing. A novel metric multilayer process space coverage metric is proposed to quantitatively gauge the quality of path selection. We then show that such a metric is directly linked to the order statistics, and our recursive algorithm can thus be applied. By employing a branch-and-bound path selection algorithm with these techniques, this article shows that selecting an optimal set of paths for a multimillion-gate design can be performed efficiently. Compared to the state of the art, experimental results show both the efficiency of our algorithms and better quality of our path selection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13337","fieldValue":" Due to high switching activities in test mode, circuit power consumption is higher than its functional operation. Large switching in the circuit during launch-to-capture cycles not only negatively impacts circuit performance causing overkill, but could also burn tester probes during wafer test due to the excessive current they must drive. It is necessary to develop a quick and effective method for evaluating each pattern, identifing high-power patterns considering functional and tester probes' current limits and making the final pattern set power-safe. Compared with previous low-power methods that deal with scan structure modification or pattern filling techniques, the new proposed method takes into account layout information and resistance in the power distribution network and can identify peak current among C4 power bumps. Post-processing steps replace power-unsafe patterns with low-power ones. The final pattern set provides considerable peak current reduction while fault coverage is maintained."}
