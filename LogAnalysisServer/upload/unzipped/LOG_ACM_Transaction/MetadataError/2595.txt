A transformation method is used which employs the QZ algorithm to structure the equation in such a way that it can be solved columnwise by a back substitution technique. The algorithm is an extension of the Bartels-Stewart method and the Hessenberg-Schur method. The numerical performance of the algorithms and software is demonstrated by application to near-singular systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18742","fieldValue":" This paper documents a software package for solving the Sylvester matrix equation (1) AXBT + CXDT = e All quantities are real matrices; A and C are m x n; B and D are m x n; and X and E are m x n. The unknown is X. Two symmetric forms of Eq. (1) are treated separately for efficiency. They are the continuous-time symmetric Sylvester equation (2) AXET + EXAT + C = 0 and the discrete time equation (3) AXAT + C = 0, for which A, E, and C is symmetric. The software also provides a means for estimating the condition number of these three equations. The algorithms employed are more fully described in an accompanying paper [3]."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18742","fieldValue":"Algorithm 705; a FORTRAN-77 software package for solving the Sylvester matrix equation AXBT + CXDT = E"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18743","fieldValue":" This paper discusses CELEFUNT, a pakage of Fortran programs for testing complex elementary functions."}
