{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3396","fieldValue":" Multiview auto-stereoscopic displays support both stereopsis and head motion parallax depth cues and could be superior for certain tasks. Previous work suggests that a high viewpoint density (100 views\/10cm at the eye) is required to convincingly support motion parallax. However, it remains unclear how viewpoint density affects task performance, and this factor is critical in determining display and system design requirements. Therefore, we present a simulated multiview display apparatus to undertake experiments using a path-searching task in which we control two independent variables: the stereoscopic depth and the viewpoint density. In the first experiment, we varied both cues and found that even small amounts of stereo depth (2cm) reliably improved task accuracy and reduced latency, whereas there was no evidence of dependence on viewpoint density. In the second experiment, we switched off the stereoscopic cue and varied viewpoint density alone. We found that for these monoscopic images increasing viewpoint density resulted in some reduction in response latency (up to eight views\/10cm) but had no effect on accuracy. We conclude for cases where occlusion is not an overriding factor that low viewpoint densities may be sufficient to enable effective path-searching task performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3396","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3396","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24786","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a new approach to assessing uniform random number generators, the weighted spectral test, or diaphony. In contrast to the usual spectral test the weighted spectral test is not limited to random number generators with a lattice structure. Its computational complexity is O s&dot;N^2$ for any point set of cardinality N in the s-dimensional unit cube. As the main results of this article, we prove an analog of the classical inequality of Erdös-Turán-Koksma, present the necessary tools to transcribe known discrepancy bounds into bounds for diaphony, and provide bounds for the diaphony of multiplicative congruetial pseudorandom numbers. The last section contains numerical results.\\"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24787","fieldValue":" We present a spectral test analysis of full-period subsequences with small step sizes generated by well-known linear congruential pseudorandom number generators.

LSS is developed as a combination of two widely used methods: Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC). In LSS, the input variables are grouped into subsets, and a lower-dimensional QMC method is used within each subset. The QMC points are presented in random order within subsets. QMC methods have been observed to lose effectiveness in high-dimensional problems. This article shows that LSS can extend the benefits of QMC to much higher dimensions, when one can make a good grouping of input variables. Some suggestions for grouping variables are given for the motivating examples. Even a poor grouping can still be expected to do as well as LHS. The article also extends LHS and LSS to infinite-dimensional problems. The paper includes a survey of QMC methods, randomized versions of them (RQMC), and previous methods for extending QMC to higher dimensions. Furthermore it shows that LSS applied with RQMC is more reliable than LSS with QMC."}
