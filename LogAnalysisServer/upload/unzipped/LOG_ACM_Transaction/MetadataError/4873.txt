One approach to investigate olfactory perception is to analyze the alterations in brain activity during stimulation with different odors. In this article, the changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) when perceiving hedonically-different odors are studied. Results of within and across-subject analysis are presented. We show that EEG-based odor classification using brain activity is possible and can be used to automatically recognize odor pleasantness when a subject-specific classifier is trained. However, it is a challenging problem to design a generic classifier."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25648","fieldValue":" Current QoE research is mainly focusing on single modalities (audio, visual) or combinations thereof. In our research, we propose annotating traditional multimedia content with additional sensory effects, such as ambient light, vibration, wind, and olfaction, which could potentially stimulate all human senses. Investigating the influence of individual sensory effects and combinations thereof is important in order to understand how these individual sensory effects influence the Quality of Experience (QoE) as a whole. In this article, we describe the results of such a subjective quality assessment of audio-visual sequences which are annotated with additional sensory effects such as ambient light, wind, and vibration using the MPEG-V standard. The results of this assessment allow us to derive a utility model representing the Quality of Sensory Experience (QuaSE) complementary to existing QoE models described in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. For validating our proposed utility model, we provide an example instantiation and validate it against results of subjective quality assessments."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25648","fieldValue":"MPEG-V"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25648","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25648","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25649","fieldValue":"Muntean, Gabriel-Miro"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25649","fieldValue":" User Quality of Experience (QoE) is of fundamental importance in multimedia applications and has been extensively studied for decades. However, user QoE in the context of the emerging multiple-sensorial media (mulsemedia) services, which involve different media components than the traditional multimedia applications, have not been comprehensively studied. This article presents the results of subjective tests which have investigated user perception of mulsemedia content. In particular, the impact of intensity of certain mulsemedia components including haptic and airflow on user-perceived experience are studied. Results demonstrate that by making use of mulsemedia the overall user enjoyment levels increased by up to 77&percnt;."}
