Recoloring tools have been developed to address the problem, but current recolorers are limited in that they work from a model of only one type of congenital CVD (i.e., dichromatism). This model does not adequately describe many other forms of CVD (e.g., more common congenital deficiencies such as anomalous trichromacy, acquired deficiencies such as cataracts or age-related yellowing of the lens, or temporary deficiencies such as wearing tinted glasses or working in bright sunlight), and so standard recolorers work poorly in many situations. In this article we describe an alternate approach that can address these limitations. The new approach, called Situation-Specific Modeling (SSM), constructs a model of a specific userâ\u20AC™s color differentiation abilities in a specific situation, and uses that model as the basis for recoloring digital presentations. As a result, SSM can inherently handle all types of CVD, whether congenital, acquired, or environmental. In this article we describe and evaluate several models that are based on the SSM approach. Our first model of individual color differentiation (called ICD-1) works in RGB color space, and a user study showed it to be accurate and robust (both for users with and without congenital CVD). However, three aspects of ICD-1 were identified as needing improvement: the calibration step needed to build the situation-specific model, and the prediction steps used in recoloring were too slow for real-world use; and the results of the modelâ\u20AC™s predictions were too coarse for some uses. We therefore developed three further techniques: ICD-2 reduces the time needed to calibrate the model; ICD-3 reduces the time needed to make predictions with the model; and ICD-4 provides additional information about the degree of differentiability in a prediction. Our final result is a model of the userâ\u20AC™s color perception that handles any type of CVD, can be calibrated in two minutes, and can find replacement colors in near-real time $(^~$1 second for a 64-color image). The ICD models provide a tool that can greatly improve the perceptibility of digital color for many different types of CVD users, and also demonstrates situation-specific modeling as a new approach that can broaden the applicability of assistive technology."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1462","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1462","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5518","fieldValue":" Network-accessible multimedia databases, repositories, and libraries are proliferating at a rapid rate. A crucial problem for these repositories remains timely and appropriate document access. In this article, we borrow a model from psychological research on human memory, which has long studied retrieval of memory items based on frequency and recency rates of past item occurrences. Specifically, the model uses frequency and recency rates of prior document accesses to predict future document requests. The model is illustrated by analyzing the log file of document accesses to the Georgia Institute of Technology World Wide Web (WWW) repository, a large multimedia respository exhibiting high access rates. Results show that the model predicts document access rates with a reliable degree of accuracy. We describe extensions to the basic approach that combine the recency and frequency analyses and which incorporate respository structure and document type. These results have implications for the formulation of descriptive user models of information access in large repositories. In addition, we sketch applications in the areas of design of information systems and interfaces and their document-caching algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5519","fieldValue":"Author Index"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5519","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5519","fieldValue":"ACM"}
