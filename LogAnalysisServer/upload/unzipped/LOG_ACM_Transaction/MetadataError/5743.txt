To exploit the information spread across multiple sources for protein function prediction, these data sources are transformed into kernels and then integrated into a composite kernel. Several methods first optimize the weights on these kernels to produce a composite kernel, and then train a classifier on the composite kernel. As such, these approaches result in an optimal composite kernel, but not necessarily in an optimal classifier. On the other hand, some approaches optimize the loss of binary classifiers and learn weights for the different kernels iteratively. For multi-class or multi-label data, these methods have to solve the problem of optimizing weights on these kernels for each of the labels, which are computationally expensive and ignore the correlation among labels. In this paper, we propose a method called Predicting Protein Function using Multiple Kernels (ProMK). ProMK iteratively optimizes the phases of learning optimal weights and reduces the empirical loss of multi-label classifier for each of the labels simultaneously. ProMK can integrate kernels selectively and downgrade the weights on noisy kernels. We investigate the performance of ProMK on several publicly available protein function prediction benchmarks and synthetic datasets. We show that the proposed approach performs better than previously proposed protein function prediction approaches that integrate multiple data sources and multi-label multiple kernel learning methods.

This problem is NP-complete in the general case, but polynomially solvable for (k, l)-bounded instances for certain k and l. Here, k denotes the maximum number of ambiguous sites in any genotype, and l is the maximum number of genotypes that are ambiguous at the same site. Only the complexity of the (*, 2)-bounded problem is still unknown, where * denotes no restriction. It has been proved that (*, 2)-bounded instances have compatibility graphs that can be constructed from cliques and circuits by pasting along an edge. In this paper, we give a constructive proof of the fact that (*, 2)-bounded instances are polynomially solvable if the compatibility graph is constructed by pasting cliques, trees and circuits along a bounded number of edges. We obtain this proof by solving a slightly generalized problem on circuits, trees and cliques respectively, and arguing that all possible combinations of optimal solutions for these graphs that are pasted along a bounded number of edges can be enumerated efficiently."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5198","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5198","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5198","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4156","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
