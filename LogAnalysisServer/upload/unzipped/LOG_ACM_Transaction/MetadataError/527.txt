Our previously published results showed that the defect level of circuit fabrication and testing should be a probability distribution, rather than a single value, and the concept of confidence degree was proposed [Gondalia et al. 1993; Jone et al. 1995]. In this work, defect level is represented by a confidence interval which is more conventional and easier to interpret. The point estimate of defect level analysis and conditions to avoid meaningless confidence intervals are also investigated. Methods for adaptive random test length determination driven by different confidence intervals or interval length are proposed to meet both test requirements and test costs tradeoff. Finally, a complete test plan that can direct the test flow from fabrication infancy to maturity is suggested."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12729","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12729","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12730","fieldValue":" Embedded systems consist of interacting components that are required to deliver a specific functionality under constraints on execution rates and relative time separation of the components. In this article, we model an embedded system using concurrent processes interacting through synchronization. We assume that there are rate constraints on the execution rates of processes imposed by the designer or the environment of the system, where the execution rate of a process is the number of its executions per unit time. We address the problem of computing bounds on the execution rates of processes constituting an embedded system, and propose an interactive rate analysis framework. As part of the rate analysis framework we present an efficient algorithms for checking the consistency of the rate constraints. Bounds on the execution rate of each process are computed using an efficient algorithm based on the relationship between the execution rate of a process and the maximum mean delay cycles in the process graph. Finally, if the computed rates violate some of the rate constraints, some of the processes in the system are redesigned using information from the rate analysis step. This rate analysis framework is implemented in a tool called RATAN. We illustrate by an example how RATAN can be used in an embedded system design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12730","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12730","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12731","fieldValue":" We study the technology mapping problem for sequential circuits for look-up table (LUT) based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Existing approaches to the problem simply remove the flip-flops (FFs), then map the remaining combinational logic, and finally put the FFs back. These approaches ignore the sequential nature of a circuit and assume the positions of the FFs are fixed. However, FFs in a sequential circuit can be reposistioned by a functionality-preserving transformation called retiming. As a result, existing approaches can only consider a very small portion of the available solution space. We propose in this paper a novel approach to the technology mapping problem. In our approach, retiming is integrated into the technology mapping process so as to consider the full solution space. We then present a polynomial technology mapping algorithm that, for a given circuit, produces a mapping solution with the minimum clock period among all possible ways of retiming. The effectiveness of the algorithm is also demonstrated experimentally."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12731","fieldValue":"ACM"}
