The proposed models (referred to as iPC3 and oPC3) address issues associated with the control of multivariate contextual information transmission in a stationary WSN. Because WSN nodes are typically battery equipped, the primary design goal of the models is to optimize the amount of energy used for data transmission while retaining data accuracy at high levels. The proposed energy conservation techniques and algorithms are based on incremental principal component analysis and optimal stopping theory. iPC3 and oPC3 models are presented and compared with PC3 and other models found in the literature through simulations. The proposed models manage to extend the lifetime of a WSN application by improving energy efficiency within WSN."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21526","fieldValue":"Brown, Kenneth N"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21526","fieldValue":"Sreenan, Cormac J"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21526","fieldValue":" Opportunistic data collection in wireless sensor networks uses passing smartphones to collect data from sensor nodes, thus avoiding the cost of multiple static sink nodes. Based on the observed mobility patterns of smartphone users, sensor data should be preforwarded to the nodes that are visited more frequently with the aim of improving network throughput. In this article, we construct a formal network model and an associated theoretical optimization problem to maximize the throughput subject to energy constraints of sensor nodes. Since a centralized controller is not available in opportunistic data collection, data pre-forwarding (DPF) must operate as a distributed mechanism in which each node decides when and where to forward data based on local information. Hence, we develop a simple distributed DPF mechanism with two heuristic algorithms, implement this proposal in Contiki-OS, and evaluate it thoroughly. We demonstrate empirically, in simulations, that our approach is close to the optimal solution obtained by a centralized algorithm. We also demonstrate that this approach performs well in scenarios based on real mobility traces of smartphone users. Finally, we evaluate our proposal on a small laboratory testbed, demonstrating that the distributed DPF mechanism with heuristic algorithms performs as predicted by simulations, and thus that it is a viable technique for opportunistic data collection through smartphones."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21527","fieldValue":"Mccann, Julie A"}
