That is, each polygon vertex is a point on a cell edge, between two adjacent sample points, where the function is estimated to equal the desired threshold value. The two sample points have values on opposite sides of the threshold, and the interpolated point is called an intersection point.When one cell face has an intersection point in each of its four edges, then the correct connection among intersection points becomes ambiguous. An incorrect connection can lead to erroneous topology in the rendered surface, and possible discontinuities. We show that disambiguation methods, to be at all accurate, need to consider sample values in the neighborhood outside the cell. This paper studies the problems of disambiguation, reports on some solutions, and presents some statistics on the occurrence of such ambiguities.A natural way to incorporate neighborhood information is through the use of calculated gradients at cell corners. They provide insight into the behavior of a function in well-understood ways. We introduce two gradient consistency heuristics that use calculated gradients at the corners of ambiguous faces, as well as the function values at those corners, to disambiguate at a reasonable computational cost. These methods give the correct topology on several examples that caused problems for other methods we examined."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15109","fieldValue":" Height distributional distance transform (HDDT) methods are introduced as a new class of methods for height field ray tracing. HDDT methods utilize results of height field preprocessing. The preprocessing involves computing a height field transform representing an array of cone-like volumes of empty space above the height field surface that are as wide as possible. There is one cone-like volume balanced on its apex centered above each height field cell. Various height field transforms of this type are developed. Each is based on distance transforms of height field horizontal cross-sections. HDDT methods trace rays through empty cone-like volumes instead of through successive height field cells. The performance of HDDT methods is evaluated experimentally against existing height field ray tracing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15109","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15109","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15110","fieldValue":"Shene, Ching-Kuang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15110","fieldValue":" In general, two quadric surface intersect in a space quartic curve. However, the intersection frequently degenerates to a collection of plane curves. Degenerate cases are frequent in geometric\/solid modeling because degeneracies are often required by design. Their detection is important because degenerate intersections can be computed more easily and allow simpler treatment of important problems. In this paper, we investigate this problem for natural quadrics. Algorithms are presented to detect and compute conic intersections and linear intersections. These methods reveal the relationship between the planes of the degenerate intersections and the quadrics. Using the theory developed in the paper, we present a new and simplified proof of a necessary and sufficient condition for conic intersection. Finally, we present a simple method for determining the types of conic in a degenerate intersection without actually computing the intersection, and an enumeration of all possible conic types. Since only elementary geometric routines such as line intersection are used, all of the above algorithms are intuitive and easily implementable."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15110","fieldValue":"ACM"}
