Building designs are derived using split grammars, a new type of parametric set grammar based on the concept of shape. The paper also introduces an attribute matching system and a separate control grammar, which offer the flexibility required to model buildings using a large variety of different styles and design ideas. Through the adaptive nature of the design grammar used, the created building designs can either be generic or adhere closely to a specified goal, depending on the amount of data available."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15348","fieldValue":" We present an incremental algorithm to compute image-based simplifications of a large environment. We use an optimization-based approach to generate samples based on scene visibility, and from each viewpoint create textured depth meshes (TDMs) using sampled range panoramas of the environment. The optimization function minimizes artifacts such as skins and cracks in the reconstruction. We also present an encoding scheme for multiple TDMs that exploits spatial coherence among different viewpoints. The resulting simplifications, incremental textured depth meshes (ITDMs), reduce preprocessing, storage, rendering costs and visible artifacts. Our algorithm has been applied to large, complex synthetic environments comprising millions of primitives. It is able to render them at 20 -- 40 frames a second on a PC with little loss in visual fidelity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15348","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15348","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2454","fieldValue":" The problem of maximizing a concave function f(x) in the unit simplex Î\u201D can be solved approximately by a simple greedy algorithm.

This algorithm and analysis were known before, and related to problems of statistics and machine learning, such as boosting, regression, and density mixture estimation. In other work, coming from computational geometry, the existence of &epsis;-coresets was shown for the minimum enclosing ball problem by means of a simple greedy algorithm. Similar greedy algorithms, which are special cases of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, were described for other enclosure problems. Here these results are tied together, stronger convergence results are reviewed, and several coreset bounds are generalized or strengthened."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15349","fieldValue":" We introduce billboard clouds -- a new approach for extreme simplification in the context of real-time rendering. 3D models are simplified onto a set of planes with texture and transparency maps. We present an optimization approach to build a billboard cloud given a geometric error threshold. After computing an appropriate density function in plane space, a greedy approach is used to select suitable representative planes. A good surface approximation is ensured by favoring planes that are \"nearly tangent\" to the model. This method does not require connectivity information, but instead avoids cracks by projecting primitives onto multiple planes when needed. For extreme simplification, our approach combines the strengths of mesh decimation and image-based impostors. We demonstrate our technique on a large class of models, including smooth manifolds and composite objects."}
