We propose a new objective based on compressive weighting that controls rendering error in high-dynamic-range BRDF fits better than previous factorization approaches. We develop a simple numerical procedure to minimize this objective and handle dependencies that arise between microfacet factors. Our method faithfully captures a more comprehensive set of materials than previous state-of-the-art parametric approaches yet remains compact (3.2KB per BRDF). We experimentally validate the benefit of the microfacet model over a na√Øve orthogonal factorization and show that fidelity for diffuse materials is modestly improved by fitting an unrestricted shadowing\/masking factor. We also compare against a recent data-driven factorization approach [Bilgili et al. 2011] and show that our microfacet-based representation improves rendering accuracy for most materials while reducing storage by more than 10 √\u2014."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17656","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17656","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17657","fieldValue":"ztireli, A.

We derive exact formulae for bias and variance of integral estimates in terms of the spatial or spectral characteristics of integrands and first- and-second order product density measures of general point patterns. The formulae allow us to study and design sampling schemes adapted to different classes of integrands by analyzing the effect of sampling density, weighting, and correlations among point locations separately. We then focus on non-adaptive correlated stratified sampling patterns and specialize the formulae to derive closed-form and easy-to-analyze expressions of bias and variance for various stratified sampling strategies. Based on these expressions, we perform a theoretical error analysis for integrands involving the discontinuous visibility function. We show that significant reductions in error can be obtained by considering alternative sampling strategies instead of the commonly used random jittering or low discrepancy patterns. Our theoretical results agree with and extend various previous results, provide a unified analytic treatment of point patterns, and lead to novel insights. We validate the results with extensive experiments on benchmark integrands as well as real scenes with soft shadows."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17657","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: ETH Zurich, Z&#252;rich, Switzerland (ztireli, A.
