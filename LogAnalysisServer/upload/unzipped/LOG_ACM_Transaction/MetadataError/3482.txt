In this article, we introduce the first algorithm that reduces sensor coverage redundancy through joint Sensor Activation and sensing Radius Adaptation (SARA) in general application scenarios comprising two classes of devices: sensors with variable sensing radius and sensors with fixed sensing radius. This device heterogeneity is explicitly addressed by modeling the coverage problem through Voronoi-Laguerre diagrams that, differently from Voronoi diagrams, allow for correctly identifying each sensor coverage region depending on the sensor current radius and the radii of its neighboring nodes. SARA executes quickly with guaranteed termination and, given the currently available nodes, it always guarantees maximum coverage. By means of extensive simulations, we show that SARA obtains remarkable improvements with respect to previous solutions, ensuring, in networks with heterogeneous nodes, longer network lifetime and wider coverage."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21385","fieldValue":"Van Steen, Maarten"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21385","fieldValue":" Hierarchical routing has often been mentioned as an appealing point-to-point routing technique for wireless sensor networks (sensornets). While there is a volume of analytical and high-level simulation results demonstrating its merits, there has been little work evaluating it in actual sensornet settings. This article bridges the gap between theory and practice. Having analyzed a number of proposed hierarchical routing protocols, we have developed a framework that captures the common characteristics of the protocols and identifies design points at which the protocols differ. We use a sensornet implementation of the framework in TOSSIM and on a 60-node testbed to study various trade-offs that hierarchical routing introduces, as well as to compare the performance of hierarchical routing with the performance of other routing techniques, namely shortest-path routing, compact routing, and beacon vector routing. The results show that hierarchical routing is a compelling routing technique also in practice. In particular, despite only logarithmic routing state, it can offer small routing stretch: an average of âˆ¼ 1.25 and a 99th percentile of 2. It can also be robust, minimizing the maintenance traffic or the latency of reacting to changes in the network. Moreover, the trade-offs offered by hierarchical routing are attractive for many sensornet applications when compared to the other routing techniques. For example, in terms of routing state, hierarchical routing can offer scalability at least an order of magnitude better than compact routing, and at the same time, in terms of routing stretch, its performance is within 10--15&percnt; of that of compact routing; in addition, this performance can further be tuned to a particular application. Finally, we also identify a number of practical issues and limitations of which we believe sensornet developers adopting hierarchical routing should be aware."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21385","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21385","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21386","fieldValue":" Coverage estimation is one of the fundamental problems in sensor networks. Coverage estimation in visual sensor networks (VSNs) is more challenging than in conventional 1-D (omnidirectional) scalar sensor networks (SSNs) because of the directional sensing nature of cameras and the existence of visual occlusion in crowded environments. This article represents a first attempt toward a closed-form solution for the visual coverage estimation problem in the presence of occlusions. We investigate a new target detection model, referred to as the certainty-based target detection (as compared to the traditional uncertainty-based target detection) to facilitate the formulation of the visual coverage problem. We then derive the closed-form solution for the estimation of the visual coverage probability based on this new target detection model that takes visual occlusions into account. According to the coverage estimation model, we further propose an estimate of the minimum sensor density that suffices to ensure a visual K-coverage in a crowded sensing field. Simulation is conducted which shows extreme consistency with results from theoretical formulation, especially when the boundary effect is considered. Thus, the closed-form solution for visual coverage estimation is effective when applied to real scenarios, such as efficient sensor deployment and optimal sleep scheduling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21386","fieldValue":"ACM"}
