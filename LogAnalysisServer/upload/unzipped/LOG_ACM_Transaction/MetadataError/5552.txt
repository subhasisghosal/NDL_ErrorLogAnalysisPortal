They have the, as yet unexploited, potential to give insight into biological features of the sequences. We introduce several innovations to the production and use of side effect machine sequence features. We compare the results of using consensus sequences and genomic sequences for training classifiers and find that more accurate results can be obtained using genomic sequences. Surprisingly, we were even able to build a classifier that distinguished consensus sequences from genomic sequences with high accuracy, suggesting that consensus sequences are not always representative of their genomic counterparts. We apply our techniques to the problem of distinguishing two types of transposable elements, solo LTRs and SINEs. Identifying these sequences is important because they affect gene expression, genome structure, and genetic diversity, and they serve as genetic markers. They are of similar length, neither codes for protein, and both have many nearly identical copies throughout the genome. Being able to efficiently and automatically distinguish them will aid efforts to improve annotations of genomes. Our approach reveals structural characteristics of the sequences of potential interest to biologists."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4849","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4849","fieldValue":"Bioinformatics,Genomics,Genetic algorithms,DNA,Accuracy,Humans,Correlation,side effect machines,Endogenous retroviruses,LTR retrotransposons,SINE elements,feature evaluation and selection,machine learning,evolutionary computing and genetic algorithms"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4849","fieldValue":"Distinguishing Endogenous Retroviral LTRs from SINE Elements Using Features Extracted from Evolved Side Effect Machines"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4849","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4849","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4850","fieldValue":"Tsai, Richard Tzong-Han"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4850","fieldValue":" Protein-protein interaction (PPI) database curation requires text-mining systems that can recognize and normalize interactor genes and return a ranked list of PPI pairs for each article. The order of PPI pairs in this list is essential for ease of curation. Most of the current PPI pair ranking approaches rely on association analysis between the two genes in the pair. However, we propose that ranking an extracted PPI pair by considering both the association between the paired genes and each of those genes' global associations with all other genes mentioned in the paper can provide a more reliable ranked list. In this work, we present a composite interaction score that considers not only the association score between two interactors (pair association score) but also their global association scores. We test three representative data fusion algorithms to estimate this global association scoreâ\u20AC\u201Dtwo Borda-Fuse models and one linear combination model (LCM). The three estimation methods are evaluated using the data set of the BioCreative II.5 Interaction Pair Task (IPT) in terms of area under the interpolated precision\/recall curve (AUC iP\/R). Our experimental results indicate that using LCM to estimate the global association score can boost the AUC iP\/R score from 0.0175 to 0.2396, outperforming the best BioCreative II.5 IPT system."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4850","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4850","fieldValue":"Accuracy,Databases,Training,Proteins,Mutual information,Bioinformatics,Protein engineering,bioinformatics databases,Text mining"}
