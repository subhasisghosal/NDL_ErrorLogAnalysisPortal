{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4000","fieldValue":" It is known that differential microphone arrays are sensitive to microphone mismatches. This paper studies the effects of microphone mismatches on the directivity factor (DF) of the first-order steerable differential array (FOSDA) whose response is constructed by a linear combination of monopole and two orthogonal dipoles via a small four-microphone array. In particular, the DF of the FOSDA is studied from two perspectives, i.e., a deterministic analysis for deterministic microphone gain\/phase errors, and a worst-case analysis for uncertain microphone gain\/phase errors. Based on the theoretical analysis, several interesting properties are revealed, which are helpful to better understand the robustness characteristics of the FOSDA. Moreover, by worst-case analysis, it provides a useful guidance for robust FOSDA design, i.e., how to determine array size and select microphones with required characteristics such that a desired DF value can be guaranteed. In addition, the effect of sensor self-noise on the DF of the FOSDA is also discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4000","fieldValue":"Directivity factors of the first-order steerable differential array with microphone mismatches: deterministic and worst-case analysis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4001","fieldValue":" We propose a fast speech analysis method which simultaneously performs high-resolution voiced\/unvoiced detection (VUD) and accurate estimation of glottal closure and glottal opening instants (GCIs and GOIs, respectively). The proposed algorithm exploits the structure of the glottal flow derivative in order to estimate GCIs and GOIs only in voiced speech using simple time-domain criteria. We compare our method with well-known GCI\/GOI methods, namely, the dynamic programming projected phase-slope algorithm (DYPSA), the yet another GCI\/GOI algorithm (YAGA) and the speech event detection using the residual excitation and a mean-based signal (SEDREAMS). Furthermore, we examine the performance of the aforementioned methods when combined with state-of-the-art VUD algorithms, namely, the robust algorithm for pitch tracking (RAPT) and the summation of residual harmonics (SRH). Experiments conducted on the APLAWD and SAM databases show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art combinations of VUD and GCI\/GOI algorithms with respect to almost all evaluation criteria for clean speech. Experiments on speech contaminated with several noise types (white Gaussian, babble, and car-interior) are also presented and discussed. The proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art combinations in most evaluation criteria for signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10 dB."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4001","fieldValue":"A fast method for high-resolution voiced\/unvoiced detection and glottal closure\/opening instant estimation of speech"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4002","fieldValue":" This paper discusses real-time alignment of audio signals of music performance to the corresponding score (a.k.a. score following) which can handle tempo changes, errors and arbitrary repeats and\/or skips (repeats\/skips) in performances. This type of score following is particularly useful in automatic accompaniment for practices and rehearsals, where errors and repeats\/skips are often made. Simple extensions of the algorithms previously proposed in the literature are not applicable in these situations for scores of practical length due to the problem of large computational complexity. To cope with this problem, we present two hidden Markov models of monophonic performance with errors and arbitrary repeats\/skips, and derive efficient score-following algorithms with an assumption that the prior probability distributions of score positions before and after repeats\/skips are independent from each other. We confirmed real-time operation of the algorithms with music scores of practical length (around 10000 notes) on a modern laptop and their tracking ability to the input performance within 0.7 s on average after repeats\/skips in clarinet performance data. Further improvements and extension for polyphonic signals are also discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4002","fieldValue":"Real-time audio-to-score alignment of music performances containing errors and arbitrary repeats and skips"}
