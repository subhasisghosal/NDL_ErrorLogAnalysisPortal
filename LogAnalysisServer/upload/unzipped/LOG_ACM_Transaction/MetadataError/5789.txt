Instead of investigating them independently, several recent studies have convincingly demonstrated that a wealth of scientific insights can be gained by integrative analysis of these ChIP-seq data. However, when used for the purpose of integrative analysis, a serious drawback of current ChIP-seq technique is that it is still expensive and time-consuming to generate ChIP-seq datasets of high standard. Most researchers are therefore unable to obtain complete ChIP-seq data for several TFs in a wide variety of cell lines, which considerably limits the understanding of transcriptional regulation pattern. In this paper, we propose a novel method called ChIP-PIT to overcome the aforementioned limitation. In ChIP-PIT, ChIP-seq data corresponding to a diverse collection of cell types, TFs and genes are fused together using the three-mode pair-wise interaction tensor (PIT) model, and the prediction of unperformed ChIP-seq experimental results is formulated as a tensor completion problem. Computationally, we propose efficient first-order method based on extensions of coordinate descent method to learn the optimal solution of ChIP-PIT, which makes it particularly suitable for the analysis of massive scale ChIP-seq data. Experimental evaluation the ENCODE data illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5287","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5287","fieldValue":"ChIP-PIT: enhancing the analysis of ChIP-seq data using convex-relaxed pair-wise interaction tensor decomposition"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5288","fieldValue":"Hsiao, Yu-Ting"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5288","fieldValue":"Lee, Wei-Po"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5288","fieldValue":" Modeling gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is essential for conceptualizing how genes are expressed and how they influence each other. Typically, a reverse engineering approach is employed; this strategy is effective in reproducing possible fitting models of GRNs. To use this strategy, however, two daunting tasks must be undertaken: one task is to optimize the accuracy of inferred network behaviors; and the other task is to designate valid biological topologies for target networks. Although existing studies have addressed these two tasks for years, few of the studies can satisfy both of the requirements simultaneously. To address these difficulties, we propose an integrative modeling framework that combines knowledge-based and data-driven input sources to construct biological topologies with their corresponding network behaviors. To validate the proposed approach, a real dataset collected from the cell cycle of the yeast S. cerevisiae is used. The results show that the proposed framework can successfully infer solutions that meet the requirements of both the network behaviors and biological structures. Therefore, the outcomes are exploitable for future in vivo experimental design."}
