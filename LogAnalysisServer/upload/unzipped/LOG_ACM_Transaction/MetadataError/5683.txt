However, since there is no study of noise-resistance performance of these indices in the literature, there is no guideline for determining the best clustering in noisy data sets, especially microarray data sets. In this paper, we propose a generalized parametric validity (GPV) index which employs two tunable parameters α and β to control the proportions of objects being considered to calculate the dissimilarities. The greatest advantage of the proposed GPV index is its noise-resistance ability, which results from the flexibility of tuning the parameters. Several rules are set to guide the selection of parameter values. To illustrate the noise-resistance performance of the proposed index, we evaluate the GPV index for assessing five clustering algorithms in two gene expression data simulation models with different noise levels and compare the ability of determining the number of clusters with eight existing indices. We also test the GPV in three groups of real gene expression data sets. The experimental results suggest that the proposed GPV index has superior noise-resistance ability and provides fairly accurate judgements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5083","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5084","fieldValue":"Garca-Jimnez, Beatriz"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5084","fieldValue":" Biological pathways are important elements of systems biology and in the past decade, an increasing number of pathway databases have been set up to document the growing understanding of complex cellular processes. Although more genome-sequence data are becoming available, a large fraction of it remains functionally uncharacterized. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the mapping of poorly annotated proteins to original pathway models. Results: We have developed a Relational Learning-based Extension (RLE) system to investigate pathway membership through a function prediction approach that mainly relies on combinations of simple properties attributed to each protein. RLE searches for proteins with molecular similarities to specific pathway components. Using RLE, we associated 383 uncharacterized proteins to 28 pre-defined human Reactome pathways, demonstrating relative confidence after proper evaluation. Indeed, in specific cases manual inspection of the database annotations and the related literature supported the proposed classifications. Examples of possible additional components of the Electron transport system, Telomere maintenance and Integrin cell surface interactions pathways are discussed in detail. Availability: All the human predicted proteins in the 2009 and 2012 releases 30 and 40 of Reactome are available at http:\/\/rle.bioinfo.cnio.es."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5084","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5084","fieldValue":"Predicting protein relationships to human pathways through a relational learning approach based on simple sequence features"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5084","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5084","fieldValue":"ACM"}
