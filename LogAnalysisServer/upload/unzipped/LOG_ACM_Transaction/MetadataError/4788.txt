{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25407","fieldValue":" There are various kinds of social media information, including different types of objects and relations among these objects, in music social communities such as Last.fm and Pandora. This information is valuable for music recommendation. However, there are two main challenges to exploit this rich social media information: (a) There are many different types of objects and relations in music social communities, which makes it difficult to develop a unified framework taking into account all objects and relations. (b) In these communities, some relations are much more sophisticated than pairwise relation, and thus cannot be simply modeled by a graph. We propose a novel music recommendation algorithm by using both multiple kinds of social media information and music acoustic-based content. Instead of graph, we use hypergraph to model the various objects and relations, and consider music recommendation as a ranking problem on this hypergraph. While an edge of an ordinary graph connects only two objects, a hyperedge represents a set of objects. In this way, hypergraph can be naturally used to model high-order relations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25408","fieldValue":" Future multimedia applications will rely on the transmission of 3D video contents within heterogeneous fruition scenarios, and as a matter of fact, the reliable delivery of 3D video signals proves to be a crucial issue in such communications. To this purpose, multimedia communication experts have been designing cross-layer strategies to improve the quality of the perceived 3D experience. This article presents a new cross-layer strategy, called Cognitive Source Coding (CSC), that defines a new 3D video system able to identify the different elements of the 3D scene and choose the most appropriate coding strategy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25409","fieldValue":"Yuan, Xiao-Tong"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25409","fieldValue":"Chua, Tat-Seng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25409","fieldValue":" There are more than 66 million people suffering from hearing impairment and this disability brings them difficulty in video content understanding due to the loss of audio information. If the scripts are available, captioning technology can help them in a certain degree by synchronously illustrating the scripts during the playing of videos. However, we show that the existing captioning techniques are far from satisfactory in assisting the hearing-impaired audience to enjoy videos. In this article, we introduce a scheme to enhance video accessibility using a Dynamic Captioning approach, which explores a rich set of technologies including face detection and recognition, visual saliency analysis, text-speech alignment, etc. Different from the existing methods that are categorized as static captioning, dynamic captioning puts scripts at suitable positions to help the hearing-impaired audience better recognize the speaking characters. In addition, it progressively highlights the scripts word-by-word via aligning them with the speech signal and illustrates the variation of voice volume. In this way, the special audience can better track the scripts and perceive the moods that are conveyed by the variation of volume. We implemented the technology on 20 video clips and conducted an in-depth study with 60 real hearing-impaired users. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and usefulness of the video accessibility enhancement scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25409","fieldValue":"ACM"}
