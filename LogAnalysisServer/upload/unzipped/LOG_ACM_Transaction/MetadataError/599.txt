In particular, approximations are often useful in a distributed setting where the inputs are held by different parties and may be extremely large. Furthermore, for some applications, the parties want to compute a function of their inputs securely without revealing more information than necessary. In this work, we study the question of simultaneously addressing the above efficiency and security concerns via what we call secure approximations.We start by extending standard definitions of secure (exact) computation to the setting of secure approximations. Our definitions guarantee that no additional information is revealed by the approximation beyond what follows from the output of the function being approximated. We then study the complexity of specific secure approximation problems. In particular, we obtain a sublinear-communication protocol for securely approximating the Hamming distance and a polynomial-time protocol for securely approximating the permanent and related &num;P-hard problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2228","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2228","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12900","fieldValue":" A novel storage requirement estimation methodology is presented for use in the early system design phases when the data transfer ordering is only partially fixed. At that stage, none of the existing estimation tools are adequate, as they either assume a fully specified execution order or ignore it completely. A prototype CAD tool has been developed that includes major parts of the storage requirement estimation and optimization methodology. Using representative application demonstrators, we show how our techniques and tool can effectively guide the designer to achieve a transformed specification with low storage requirement."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12901","fieldValue":" Supply current measurement-based test is a valuable defect-based test method for semiconductor chips. Both static leakage current $(I_DDQ) and transient current (IDDT) based tests have the capability of detecting unique defects that improve the fault detection capacity of a test suite. Collectively these test methods are known as IDDX tests. However, due to advances in the semiconductor manufacturing process, the future of these test methods is uncertain. This paper presents a survey of the research reported in the literature to extend the use of IDDX$ tests to deep sub-micron (DSM) technologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/12901","fieldValue":"I<sub>DDQ<\/sub>"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/12901","fieldValue":"I<sub>DDT<\/sub> test"}
