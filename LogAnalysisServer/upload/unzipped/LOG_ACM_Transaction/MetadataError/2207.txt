The key idea of our approach is an online learning algorithm that automatically constructs a series of local mixtures of autoregressive models (MAR) to capture the complex relationships between styles of motion. We construct local MAR models on the fly by searching for the closest examples of each input pose in the database. Once the model parameters are estimated from the training data, the model adapts the current pose with simple linear transformations. In addition, we introduce an efficient local regression model to predict the timings of synthesized poses in the output style. We demonstrate the power of our approach by transferring stylistic human motion for a wide variety of actions, including walking, running, punching, kicking, jumping and transitions between those behaviors. Our method achieves superior performance in a comparison against alternative methods. We have also performed experiments to evaluate the generalization ability of our data-driven model as well as the key components of our system."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17367","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Carnegie Mellon University (Hodgins, Jessica); Institute of Computing Technology, CAS (Xia, Shihong; Wang, Congyi); Texas A&#38;M University (Chai, Jinxiang)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17367","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17367","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2643","fieldValue":" Dial-a-Ride problems consist of a set V of n vertices in a metric space (denoting travel time between vertices) and a set of m objects represented as source-destination pairs $${(si,ti)}^m_i=1, where each object requires to be moved from its source to destination vertex. In the multi-vehicle Dial-a-Ride problem, there are q vehicles, each having capacity k and where each vehicle j âˆˆ [q] has its own depot-vertex rj âˆˆ V. A feasible schedule consists of a capacitated route for each vehicle (where vehicle j originates and ends at its depot rj) that together move all objects from their sources to destinations. The objective is to find a feasible schedule that minimizes the maximum completion time (i.e., makespan) of vehicles, where the completion time of vehicle j is the time when it returns to its depot rj$ at the end of its route. We study the preemptive version of multi-vehicle Dial-a-Ride, in which an object may be left at intermediate vertices and transported by more than one vehicle, while being moved from source to destination. Our main results are an O(log3n)-approximation algorithm for preemptive multi-vehicle Dial-a-Ride, and an improved O(log t)-approximation for its special case when there is no capacity constraint (here tâ\u2030¤ n is the number of distinct depot-vertices). There is an Î© (log1\/4-&epsi; n) hardness of approximation known even for single vehicle capacitated Dial-a-Ride [GÃ¸rtz 2006]. For uncapacitated multi-vehicle Dial-a-Ride, we show that there are instances when natural lower bounds (used in our algorithm) are ËœÎ©(log t) factor away from the optimum. We also consider the special class of metrics induced by graphs excluding any fixed minor (e.g., planar metrics). In this case, we obtain improved guarantees of O(log2$ n) for capacitated multi-vehicle Dial-a-Ride, and O(1) for the uncapacitated problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2643","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2643","fieldValue":"ACM"}
