{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8241","fieldValue":" Task coordination poses significant challenges for globally dispersed teams (GDTs). Although various task coordination mechanisms have been proposed for such teams, there is a lack of systematic examination of the appropriate coordination mechanisms for different teams based on the nature of their task and the context under which they operate. Prior studies on collocated teams suggest matching their levels of task dependence to specific task coordination mechanisms for effective coordination. This research goes beyond the earlier work by also considering additional contextual factors of GDT (i.e., temporal dispersion and time constraints) in deriving their optimal IT-mediated task coordination mechanisms. Adopting the structural contingency theory, we propose optimal IT-mediated task coordination portfolios to fit the different levels of task dependence, temporal dispersion, and perceived time constraint of GDTs. The proposed fit is tested through a survey and profile analysis of 95 globally dispersed software development teams in a large financial organization. We find, as hypothesized, that the extent of fit between the actual IT-mediated task coordination portfolios used by the surveyed teams and their optimal portfolios proposed here is positively related to their task coordination effectiveness that in turn impacts the team's efficiency and effectiveness. The implications for theory and practice are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8242","fieldValue":"Basole, Rahul C"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8242","fieldValue":"Russell, Martha G"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8242","fieldValue":" Business ecosystems consist of a heterogeneous and continuously evolving set of entities that are interconnected through a complex, global network of relationships. However, there is no well-established methodology to study the dynamics of this network. Traditional approaches have primarily utilized a single source of data of relatively established firms; however, these approaches ignore the vast number of relevant activities that often occur at the individual and entrepreneurial levels. We argue that a data-driven visualization approach, using both institutionally and socially curated datasets, can provide important complementary, triangulated explanatory insights into the dynamics of interorganizational networks in general and business ecosystems in particular. We develop novel visualization layouts to help decision makers systemically identify and compare ecosystems. Using traditionally disconnected data sources on deals and alliance relationships (DARs), executive and funding relationships (EFRs), and public opinion and discourse (POD), we empirically illustrate our data-driven method of data triangulation and visualization techniques through three cases in the mobile industry Googleâ\u20AC™s acquisition of Motorola Mobility, the coopetitive relation between Apple and Samsung, and the strategic partnership between Nokia and Microsoft. The article concludes with implications and future research opportunities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8243","fieldValue":" The process view concept deploys a partial and temporal representation to adjust the visible view of a business process according to various perception constraints of users. Process view technology is of practical use for privacy protection and authorization control in process-oriented business management. Owing to complex organizational structure, it is challenging for large companies to accurately specify the diverse perception of different users over business processes. Aiming to tackle this issue, this article presents a role-based process view model to incorporate role dependencies into process view derivation. Compared to existing process view approaches, ours particularly supports runtime updates to the process view perceivable to a user with specific view merging operations, thereby enabling the dynamic tracing of process perception. A series of rules and theorems are established to guarantee the structural consistency and validity of process view transformation. A hypothetical case is conducted to illustrate the feasibility of our approach, and a prototype is developed for the proof-of-concept purpose."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8243","fieldValue":"ACM"}
