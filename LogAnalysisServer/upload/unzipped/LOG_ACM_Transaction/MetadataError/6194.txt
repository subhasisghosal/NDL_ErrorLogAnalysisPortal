{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6520","fieldValue":" Markov random field models provide a robust formulation for the stereo vision problem of inferring three-dimensional scene geometry from two images taken from different viewpoints. One of the most advanced algorithms for solving the associated energy minimization problem in the formulation is belief propagation (BP). Although BP provides very accurate results in solving stereo vision problems, the high computational cost of the algorithm hinders it from real-time applications. In recent years, multicore architectures have been widely adopted in various industrial application domains. The high computing power of multicore processors provides new opportunities to implement stereo vision algorithms. This article examines and extracts the parallelisms in the BP method for stereo vision on multicore processors. This article shows that parallelism of the algorithm can be efficiently utilized on multicore processors. The results show that parallelization on multicore processors provides a speedup for the BP algorithm of almost 15 times compared to the single-processor implementation on the PPE of the Cell BE. The experimental results also indicate that a frame rate of 6.5 frames\/second is possible when implementing the parallelized BP algorithm on the multicore processor of Cell BE with one PPE and six SPEs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6521","fieldValue":" Multicore architectures provide scalable performance with a lower hardware design effort than single core processors. Our article presents a design methodology and an embedded multicore architecture, focusing on reducing the software design complexity and boosting the performance density. First, we analyze characteristics of the Task-Level Parallelism in modern multimedia workloads. These characteristics are used to formulate requirements for the programming model. Then we translate the programming model requirements to an architecture specification, including a novel low-complexity implementation of cache coherence and a hardware synchronization unit. Our evaluation demonstrates that the novel coherence mechanism substantially simplifies hardware design, while reducing the performance by less than 18&percnt; relative to a complex snooping technique. Compared to a single processor core, the multicores have already proven to be more area- and energy-efficient. However, the multicore architectures in embedded systems still compete with highly efficient function-specific hardware accelerators. In this article we identify five architectural methods to boost performance density of multicores; microarchitectural downscaling, asymmetric multicore architectures, multithreading, generic accelerators, and conjoining. Then, we present a novel methodology to explore multicore design spaces, including the architectural methods improving the performance density. The methodology is based on a complex formula computing performances of heterogeneous multicore systems. Using this design space exploration methodology for HD and QuadHD H.264 video decoding, we estimate that the required areas of multicores in CMOS 45 nm are 2.5 $mm^2 and 8.6 mm2$, respectively. These results suggest that heterogeneous multicores are cost-effective for embedded applications and can provide a good programmability support."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6522","fieldValue":"Eltawil, Ahmed M"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6522","fieldValue":"Kurdahi, Fadi J"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6522","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a cross-layer algorithm\/architecture coexploration for wireless multimedia systems to coordinate interactions among sublayer optimizers for improvements in energy\/QoS\/reliability. By exploiting the inherent redundancy in wireless multimedia systems, we generate an expanded design space over traditional layer-specific approaches. Specifically, we control the error resilient encoder at the application layer to provide awareness of architectural exploration at the physical layer allowing new design points with lower power consumption via aggressive voltage scaling. While trying to reduce energy consumption, the fault tolerant technique compensates the effect of the hardware and network errors due to aggressive voltage scaling and lossy transmission, respectively. Our experiments on H.263 video over a WCDMA communication system demonstrate that coexploration enlarges the feasible design space, which results in significant power savings of more than 20&percnt; in the WCDMA modem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6522","fieldValue":"ACM"}
