In order to deploy reinforcement learning for policy optimization, dialogue must be modeled as a Markov Decision Process. This requires that the dialogue state must encode all relevent information obtained during the dialogue prior to that state. This can be achieved by combining the user goal, the dialogue history, and the last user action to form the dialogue state. In addition, to gain robustness to input errors, dialogue must be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and hence, a distribution over all possible states must be maintained at every dialogue turn. This poses a potential computational limitation since there can be a very large number of dialogue states. The Hidden Information State model provides a principled way of ensuring tractability in a POMDP-based dialogue model. The key feature of this model is the grouping of user goals into partitions that are dynamically built during the dialogue. In this article, we extend this model further to incorporate the notion of complements. This allows for a more complex user goal to be represented, and it enables an effective pruning technique to be implemented that preserves the overall system performance within a limited computational resource more effectively than existing approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23051","fieldValue":"POMDP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23051","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23051","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3250","fieldValue":" Sonification tools have not yet become typical components of data analysis software, despite dramatic advances in sound-production capabilities of personal computers over the past decade. However, we continue to believe that auditory displays have the potential to be highly useful for â\u20ACœsmall scaleâ\u20AC? exploration of data for normally sighted users as well as an alternative format for users with visual impairment. Demonstration of effective examples of auditory data displays and design of flexible software tools for data sonification will be key factors in determining the impact of this method of data representation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3250","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3250","fieldValue":"ACM"}
