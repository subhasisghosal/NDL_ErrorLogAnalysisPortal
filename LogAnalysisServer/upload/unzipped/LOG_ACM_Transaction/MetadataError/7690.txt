{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10190","fieldValue":" Owing to the high bandwidth provisioning, hybrid wavelength division multiplexing\/time division multiplexing (WDM\/TDM) passive optical network (PON) is becoming an attractive future-proof access network solution. In hybrid WDM\/TDM PON, tunable lasers are potential candidate light sources attributed to their multiwavelength provisioning capability and color-free property. Currently, the laser tuning time ranges from a few tens of nanoseconds to seconds, or even minutes, depending on the adopted technology. Different laser tuning time may introduce different network performance. To achieve small packet delay and ensure fairness, the schedule length for given optical network unit (ONU) requests is desired to be as short as possible. This paper illustrates contributions in four main aspects. First, we show that both preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling problems with the objective of minimizing the schedule length are NP-hard when the laser tuning time is nonzero. Second, we present a heuristic preemptive scheduling algorithm with an approximation factor of at most 2 and a heuristic nonpreemptive scheduling algorithm with an approximation factor of at most 2 - 1\/m, where m is the number of wavelengths. Third, extensive simulations have been conducted, and simulation results show that our proposed algorithms, which consider laser tuning time, achieve significantly better performances as compared to algorithms that are directly derived from existing algorithms without considering laser tuning time. Fourth, since the scheduling in one cycle is related to that in the last cycle, we provide some discussions on the scheduling in multiple cycles."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10190","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10190","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10190","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10191","fieldValue":"Kim, Seong-Lyun"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10191","fieldValue":" In this paper, we consider the CSMA\/CA multihop networks where the two end-nodes transmit their packets to each other and each intermediate node adopts network coding for delivering bidirectional flows. In addition, the neighbor nodes are randomly uniformly deployed with the Poisson Point Process. By varying the combination of the physical carrier-sensing range of the transmitter node and the target signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) set by the receiver node, we can control the interference level in the network and the degree of spatial reuse of a frequency band. The larger the carrier-sensing range is, the smaller the interference level, while the smaller the opportunity of getting a channel by a node. Similarly, the higher the target SIR value is, the more probable the retransmission (by the exponential random backoff) is, while the better the link quality on successful transmission is getting. Under this tradeoff context, we find the optimal combinations of these two factors that make the end-to-end throughput of the flow maximal for three different retransmission schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10191","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10191","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10191","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10192","fieldValue":" We investigate scaling properties of end-to-end delays in packet networks for a flow that traverses a sequence of H nodes and that experiences cross traffic at each node. When the traffic flow and the cross traffic do not satisfy independence assumptions, we find that delay bounds scale faster than linearly. More precisely, for exponentially bounded packetized traffic, we show that delays grow with Î˜(H log H) in the number of nodes on the network path. This superlinear scaling of delays is qualitatively different from the scaling behavior predicted by a worst-case analysis or by a probabilistic analysis assuming independence of traffic arrivals at network nodes."}
