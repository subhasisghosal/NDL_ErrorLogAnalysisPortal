In particular, we are interested in analyzing the relevance of F's category as indicator for its trustworthiness with respect to the specific informative goals of X. In this article, we analyze an interactive cognitive model for searching information in a world in which each agent can be considered as belonging to a specific agent's category. We also consider variability within the canonical categorical behavior and consequent influence on the trustworthiness of provided information. The introduced interactive cognitive model also allows evaluation of the trustworthiness of a source both on the basis of its category and on past direct experience with it, thus selecting the more adequate source with respect to the informative goals to achieve. We present a computational approach based on fuzzy sets and some selected simulation scenarios together with the discussion of their more interesting results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24507","fieldValue":" Trust is a central component of social interactions among humans. Many applications motivate the consideration of trust evaluation in online social networks (OSNs). Some work has been proposed based on a trusted graph. However, it is still an open challenge to construct a trusted graph, especially in terms of selecting proper recommenders, which can be used to predict the trustworthiness of an unknown target efficiently and effectively. Based on the intuition that people who are close to and influential to us can make more proper and acceptable recommendations, we present the idea of recommendation-aware trust evaluation (RATE). We further model the recommender selection problem as an optimization problem, with the objectives of higher accuracy, lower risk (uncertainty), and lower cost. Four metrics: trustworthiness, expertise, uncertainty, and cost, are identified to measure and adjust the quality of recommenders. We focus on a 1-hop recommender selection, for which we propose the FluidTrust model to better illustrate the trust--decision making process of a user. We also discuss the extension of multihop scenarios and multitarget scenarios. Experimental results, with the real social network datasets of Epinions and Advogato, validate the effectiveness of RATE: it can predict trust with higher accuracy (it gains about 20&percnt; higher accuracy in Epinions), lower risk, and less cost (about a 30&percnt; improvement)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24507","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24507","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24508","fieldValue":"Canelles, ngel Pina"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24508","fieldValue":" Social network users take advantage of anonymity to share rumors or gossip about others, making it important to provide means to report offensive conduct.
