{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5026","fieldValue":" Gene Ontology (GO) consists of a controlled vocabulary of terms, annotating a gene or gene product, structured in a directed acyclic graph. In the graph, semantic relations connect the terms, that represent the knowledge of functional description and cellular component information of gene products. GO similarity gives us a numerical representation of biological relationship between a gene set, which can be used to infer various biological facts such as protein interaction, structural similarity, gene clustering, etc. Here we introduce a new shortest path based hybrid measure of ontological similarity between two terms which combines both structure of the GO graph and information content of the terms. Here the similarity between two terms t1 and t2, referred to as GOSimPBHM(t1, t2), has two components; one obtained from the common ancestors of t1 and t2. The other from their remaining ancestors. The proposed path based hybrid measure does not suffer from the well-known shallow annotation problem. Its superiority with respect to some other popular measures is established for protein protein interaction prediction, correlation with gene expression and functional classification of genes in a biological pathway. Finally, the proposed measure is utilized to compute the average GO similarity score among the genes that are experimentally validated targets of some microRNAs. Results demonstrate that the targets of a given miRNA have a high degree of similarity in the biological process category of GO."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5026","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5027","fieldValue":" High-throughput mass spectrometers can produce massive amounts of redundant data at an astonishing rate with many of them having poor signal-to-noise (S\/N) ratio. These low S\/N ratio spectra may not get interpreted using conventional spectra-to-database matching techniques. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm, CAMS-RS (Clustering Algorithm for Mass Spectra using Restricted Space and Sampling) for clustering of raw mass spectrometry data. CAMS-RS utilizes a novel metric (called F-set) that exploits the temporal and spatial patterns to accurately assess similarity between two given spectra. The F-set similarity metric is independent of the retention time and allows clustering of mass spectrometry data from independent LC-MS\/MS runs. A novel restricted search space strategy is devised to limit the comparisons of the number of spectra. An intelligent sampling method is executed on individual bins that allow merging of the results to make the final clusters. Our experiments, using experimentally generated data sets, show that the proposed algorithm is able to cluster spectra with high accuracy and is helpful in interpreting low S\/N ratio spectra. The CAMS-RS algorithm is highly scalable with increasing number of spectra and our implementation allows clustering of up to a million spectra within minutes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5027","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5027","fieldValue":"CAMS-RS: clustering algorithm for large-scale mass spectrometry data using restricted search space and intelligent random sampling"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5028","fieldValue":" Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a newly introduced method for the detection of copy number abnormalities associated with human diseases with special focus on cancer. Specific patterns in DNA copy number variations (CNVs) can be associated with certain disease types and can facilitate prognosis and progress monitoring of the disease. Machine learning techniques have been used to model the problem of tissue typing as a classification problem. Feature selection is an important part of the classification process, because many biological features are not related to the diseases and confuse the classification tasks. Multiple feature selection methods have been proposed in the different domains where classification has been applied. In this work, we will present a new feature selection method based on structured sparsityinducing norms to identify the informative aCGH biomarkers which can help us classify different disease subtypes. To validate the performance of the proposed method, we experimentally compare it with existing feature selection methods on four publicly available aCGH data sets. In all empirical results, the proposed sparse learning based feature selection method consistently outperforms other related approaches. More important, we carefully investigate the aCGH biomarkers selected by our method, and the biological evidences in literature strongly support our results."}
