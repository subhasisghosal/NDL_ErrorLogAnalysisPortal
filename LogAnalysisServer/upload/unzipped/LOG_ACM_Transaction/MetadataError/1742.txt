We consider two parallel algorithms for the construction: a classical sparse perfect hashing approach, and cuckoo hashing, which packs elements densely by allowing an element to be stored in one of multiple possible locations. Our construction is a hybrid approach that uses both algorithms. We measure the construction time, access time, and memory usage of our implementations and demonstrate real-time performance on large datasets: for 5 million key-value pairs, we construct a hash table in 35.7 ms using 1.42 times as much memory as the input data itself, and we can access all the elements in that hash table in 15.3 ms. For comparison, sorting the same data requires 36.6 ms, but accessing all the elements via binary search requires 79.5 ms. Furthermore, we show how our hashing methods can be applied to two graphics applications: 3D surface intersection for moving data and geometric hashing for image matching."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16193","fieldValue":" We present RenderAnts, the first system that enables interactive Reyes rendering on GPUs. Taking RenderMan scenes and shaders as input, our system first compiles RenderMan shaders to GPU shaders. Then all stages of the basic Reyes pipeline, including bounding\/splitting, dicing, shading, sampling, compositing and filtering, are executed on GPUs using carefully designed data-parallel algorithms. Advanced effects such as shadows, motion blur and depth-of-field can also be rendered. In order to avoid exhausting GPU memory, we introduce a novel dynamic scheduling algorithm to bound the memory consumption during rendering. The algorithm automatically adjusts the amount of data being processed in parallel at each stage so that all data can be maintained in the available GPU memory. This allows our system to maximize the parallelism in all individual stages of the pipeline and achieve superior performance. We also propose a multi-GPU scheduling technique based on work stealing so that the system can support scalable rendering on multiple GPUs. The scheduler is designed to minimize inter-GPU communication and balance workloads among GPUs. We demonstrate the potential of RenderAnts using several complex RenderMan scenes and an open source movie entitled Elephants Dream. Compared to Pixar's PRMan, our system can generate images of comparably high quality, but is over one order of magnitude faster. For moderately complex scenes, the system allows the user to change the viewpoint, lights and materials while producing photorealistic results at interactive speed."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16193","fieldValue":"GPGPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16194","fieldValue":" \"To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images.\" - Plato, The Republic Shadow art is a unique form of sculptural art where the 2D shadows cast by a 3D sculpture are essential for the artistic effect. We introduce computational tools for the creation of shadow art and propose a design process where the user can directly specify the desired shadows by providing a set of binary images and corresponding projection information. Since multiple shadow images often contradict each other, we present a geometric optimization that computes a 3D shadow volume whose shadows best approximate the provided input images. Our analysis shows that this optimization is essential for obtaining physically realizable 3D sculptures. The resulting shadow volume can then be modified with a set of interactive editing tools that automatically respect the often intricate shadow constraints. We demonstrate the potential of our system with a number of complex 3D shadow art sculptures that go beyond what is seen in contemporary art pieces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16194","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16194","fieldValue":"ACM"}
