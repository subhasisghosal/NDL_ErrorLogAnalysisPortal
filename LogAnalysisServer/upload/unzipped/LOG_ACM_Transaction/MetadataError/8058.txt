{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10928","fieldValue":" The accuracy of wireless network packet simulation critically depends on the quality of wireless channel models. Path loss is the stationary component of the channel model affected by the shadowing in the environment. Existing path loss models are inaccurate, require excessive measurement or computational overhead, and\/or often cannot be made to represent a given environment. This paper contributes a flexible path loss model that uses a novel approach for spatially coherent interpolation from available nearby channels to allow accurate and efficient modeling of path loss. We show that the proposed model, called Double Regression (DR), generates a correlated space, allowing both the sender and the receiver to move without abrupt change in path loss. Combining DR with a traditional temporal fading model, such as Rayleigh fading, provides an accurate and efficient channel model that we integrate with the NS-2 simulator. We use measurements to validate the accuracy of the model for a number of scenarios. We also show that there is substantial impact on simulation behavior when path loss is modeled accurately. Finally, we show that unlike statistical models, DR can make a simulation representative of a given environment by using a small number of seeding measurements. Thus, DR provides a cost-effective alternative to ray tracing or detailed site surveys."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10928","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10928","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10928","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10928","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10929","fieldValue":" Backpressure routing and scheduling, with its throughput-optimal operation guarantee, is a promising technique to improve throughput in wireless multihop networks. Although backpressure is conceptually viewed as layered, the decisions of routing and scheduling are made jointly, which imposes several challenges in practice. In this work, we present Diff-Max, an approach that separates routing and scheduling and has three strengths: 1) Diff-Max improves throughput significantly; 2) the separation of routing and scheduling makes practical implementation easier by minimizing cross-layer operations; i.e., routing is implemented in the network layer and scheduling is implemented in the link layer; and 3) the separation of routing and scheduling leads to modularity; i.e., routing and scheduling are independent modules in Diff-Max, and one can continue to operate even if the other does not. Our approach is grounded in a network utility maximization (NUM) formulation and its solution. Based on the structure of Diff-Max, we propose two practical schemes: Diff-subMax and wDiff-subMax. We demonstrate the benefits of our schemes through simulation in ns-2."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10929","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10929","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10929","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10929","fieldValue":"ACM"}
