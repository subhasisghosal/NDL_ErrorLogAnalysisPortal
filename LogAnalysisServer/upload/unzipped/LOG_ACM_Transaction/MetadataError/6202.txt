With technology scaling, variability in leakage power dissipation of sensor nodes will cause increased variability in their lifetimes. In this article, we analyze how the lifetime variations of sensor nodes affect the performance of the sensor network as a whole. We demonstrate the use of the proposed framework to explore deployment cost versus performance trade-offs for sensor networks. Results indicate that up to 37&percnt; improvement in the critical lifetime of a sensor network can be obtained with a 20&percnt; increase in deployment cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6540","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6540","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6541","fieldValue":" Automatic verification tools, such as model checkers and tools based on static analysis or on abstract interpretation, have become popular in software and hardware development. They increase confidence and potentially provide rich feedback. However, with increasing complexity, verification tools themselves are more likely to contain errors. In contrast to automatic verification tools, higher-order theorem provers use mathematically founded proof strategies checked by a small proof checker to guarantee selected properties. Thus, they enjoy a high level of trustability. Properties of software and hardware systems and their justifications can be encapsulated into a certificate, thereby guaranteeing correctness of the systems, with respect to the properties. These results offer a much higher degree of confidence than results achieved by verification tools. However, higher-order theorem provers are usually slow, due to their general and minimalistic nature. Even for small systems, a lot of human interaction is required for establishing a certificate. In this work, we combine the advantages of automatic verification tools (i.e., speed and automation) with those of higher-order theorem provers (i.e., high level of trustability). The verification tool generates a certificate for each invocation. This is checked by the higher-order theorem prover, thereby guaranteeing the desired property. The generation of certificates is much easier than producing the analysis results of the verification tool in the first place. In our work, we are able to create certificates that come with an algorithmic description of the proof of the desired property as justification. We concentrate on verification tools that generate invariants of systems and certify automatically that these do indeed hold. Our approach is applied to the certification of the verdicts of a deadlock-detection tool for an asynchronous component-based language."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6541","fieldValue":"BIP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6541","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6541","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6542","fieldValue":" Micro-solar power system design is challenging because it must address long-term system behavior under highly variable solar energy conditions and consider a large space of design options. Several micro-solar power systems and models have been made, validating particular points in the whole design space. We provide a general architecture of micro-solar power systems---comprising key components and interconnections among the components---and formalize each component in an analytical or empirical model of its behavior. To model the variability of solar energy, we provide three solar radiation models, depending on the degree of information available: an astronomical model for ideal conditions, an obstructed astronomical model for estimating solar radiation under the presence of shadows and obstructions, and a weather-effect model for estimating solar radiation under weather variation. Our solar radiation models are validated with a concrete design, the HydroWatch node, thus achieving small deviation from the long-term measurement. They can be used in combination with other micro-solar system models to improve the utility of the load and estimate the behavior of micro-solar power systems more accurately. Thus, our solar radiation models provide more accurate estimations of solar radiation and close the loop for micro-solar power system modeling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6542","fieldValue":"ACM"}
