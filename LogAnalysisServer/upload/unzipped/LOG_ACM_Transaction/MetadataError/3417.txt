Wireless sensor networks make extensive use of synchronized time in many contexts (e.g., data fusion, TDMA schedules, synchronized sleep periods, etc.). We propose a time synchronization method relevant for wireless sensor networks. The solution features minimal complexity in network bandwidth, storage as well as processing, and can achieve good accuracy. Especially relevant for sensor networks, it also provides tight, deterministic bounds on offset and clock drift. A method for synchronizing the entire network is presented. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed theoretically and validated on a realistic testbed. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of precision and resource requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21212","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21212","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21213","fieldValue":" In this article we analyze the capabilities of various models of sensor networks with the Boolean sensing model for mobile or stationary sensors and targets, under random or optimal placement, independent or globally coordinated search, and stealthy or visible sensors. For each model we give an upper bound for the capabilities under any strategy, and a search strategy which at least asymptotically matches that bound. To ensure comparability of these models, we present them using the same parameters: the sensing radius r, sensor placement density Î», as well as the travel distance l of each sensor and d of the target. By this we obtain a complete analysis of the geometric coverage and detection capabilities of the various models of sensor networks, where we abstract from issues like communication and power management."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21213","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21213","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21214","fieldValue":" We consider a wireless network in which packets are forwarded opportunistically from the source towards the destination, without accurate knowledge of the direction that they should take. A Brownian motion model that includes the effect of packet losses, and subsequent retransmission after a time-out, is used to compute the average travel time of the packet. The results indicate that the average travel time is always finite provided that a time-out is used, and that there is an element of randomness in the manner in which successive nodes are being chosen. We show that the average packet travel time can be minimized by a judicious choice of the time-out, and its optimum value in turn depends on other system parameters such as packet-loss probabilities. We present simulations that illustrate the analytical results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21214","fieldValue":"ACM"}
