There are three key ingredients to our approach: 1) piecewise quadratic functions that capture the local shape of the surface, 2) weighting functions (the partitions of unity) that blend together these local shape functions, and 3) an octree subdivision method that adapts to variations in the complexity of the local shape.Our approach gives us considerable flexibility in the choice of local shape functions, and in particular we can accurately represent sharp features such as edges and corners by selecting appropriate shape functions. An error-controlled subdivision leads to an adaptive approximation whose time and memory consumption depends on the required accuracy. Due to the separation of local approximation and local blending, the representation is not global and can be created and evaluated rapidly. Because our surfaces are described using implicit functions, operations such as shape blending, offsets, deformations and CSG are simple to perform."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15322","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15322","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15323","fieldValue":" We present a progressive encoding technique specifically designed for complex isosurfaces. It achieves better rate distortion performance than all standard mesh coders, and even improves on all previous single rate isosurface coders. Our novel algorithm handles isosurfaces with or without sharp features, and deals gracefully with high topologic and geometric complexity. The inside\/outside function of the volume data is progressively transmitted through the use of an adaptive octree, while a local frame based encoding is used for the fine level placement of surface samples. Local patterns in topology and local smoothness in geometry are exploited by context-based arithmetic encoding, allowing us to achieve an average of 6.10 bits per vertex (b\/v) at very low distortion. Of this rate only 0.65 b\/v are dedicated to connectivity data: this improves by 24% over the best previous single rate isosurface encoder."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15324","fieldValue":" This paper presents a generalization of non-uniform B-spline surfaces called T-splines. T-spline control grids permit T-junctions, so lines of control points need not traverse the entire control grid. T-splines support many valuable operations within a consistent framework, such as local refinement, and the merging of several B-spline surfaces that have different knot vectors into a single gap-free model. The paper focuses on T-splines of degree three, which are $C^2 (in the absence of multiple knots). T-NURCCs (Non-Uniform Rational Catmull-Clark Surfaces with T-junctions) are a superset of both T-splines and Catmull-Clark surfaces. Thus, a modeling program for T-NURCCs can handle any NURBS or Catmull-Clark model as special cases. T-NURCCs enable true local refinement of a Catmull-Clark-type control grid: individual control points can be inserted only where they are needed to provide additional control, or to create a smoother tessellation, and such insertions do not alter the limit surface. T-NURCCs use stationary refinement rules and are C2$ except at extraordinary points and features."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15324","fieldValue":"ACM"}
