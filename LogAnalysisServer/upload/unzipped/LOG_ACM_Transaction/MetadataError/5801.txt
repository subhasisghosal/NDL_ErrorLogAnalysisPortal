Several existing algorithms formulate GRN inference as a regression problem. The available regression based algorithms are based on the assumption that all regulatory interactions are linear. However, nonlinear transcription regulation mechanisms are common in biology. In this work, we propose a new regression based method named bLARS that permits a variety of regulatory interactions from a predefined but otherwise arbitrary family of functions. On three DREAM benchmark datasets, namely gene expression data from E. coli, Yeast, and a synthetic data set, bLARS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in the terms of the overall score. On the individual networks, bLARS offers the best performance among currently available similar algorithms, namely algorithms that do not use perturbation information and are not meta-algorithms. Moreover, the presented approach can also be utilized for general feature selection problems in domains other than biology, provided they are of a similar structure."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5309","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5310","fieldValue":" Scaling linkage disequilibrium (LD) based haplotype block recognition to the entire human genome has always been a challenge. The best-known algorithm has quadratic runtime complexity and, even when sophisticated search space pruning is applied, still requires several days of computations. Here, we propose a novel sampling-based algorithm, called S-MIG$^{++}$ , where the main idea is to estimate the area that most likely contains all haplotype blocks by sampling a very small number of SNP pairs. A subsequent refinement step computes the exact blocks by considering only the SNP pairs within the estimated area. This approach significantly reduces the number of computed LD statistics, making the recognition of haplotype blocks very fast. We theoretically and empirically prove that the area containing all haplotype blocks can be estimated with a very high degree of certainty. Through experiments on the 243,080 SNPs on chromosome 20 from the 1,000 Genomes Project, we compared our previous algorithm MIG$^{++}$ with the new S-MIG$^{++}$ and observed a runtime reduction from 2.8 weeks to 34.8 hours. In a parallelized version of the S-MIG $^{++}$ algorithm using 32 parallel processes, the runtime was further reduced to 5.1 hours."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5310","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5310","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5310","fieldValue":"ACM"}
