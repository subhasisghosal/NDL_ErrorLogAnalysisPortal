Instead of focusing on abstract topological properties, we classify ASs into a number of types depending on their function and business type. Furthermore, we consider the semantics of inter-AS links: customer-provider versus peering relations. We find that the available historic datasets from RouteViews and RIPE are not sufficient to infer the evolution of peering links, and so we restrict our focus to customer-provider links. Our findings highlight some important trends in the evolution of the Internet over the last 12 years and hint at what the Internet is heading toward. After an exponential increase phase until 2001, the Internet has settled into a slower exponential growth in terms of both ASs and inter-AS links. The growth is mostly due to enterprise networks and content\/ access providers at the periphery of the Internet. The average path length remains almost constant, mostly due to the increasing multihoming degree of transit and content\/access providers. The AS types differ significantly from each other with respect to their rewiring activity; content\/access providers are the most active. A few large transit providers act as \"attractors\" or \"repellers\" of customers. For many providers, strong attractiveness precedes strong repulsiveness by 3-9 months. Finally, in terms of regional growth, we find that the AS ecosystem is now larger and more dynamic in Europe than in North America."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10220","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10221","fieldValue":"Munthe-Kaas, Ellen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10221","fieldValue":" In sparse mobile ad hoc networks, placement of services and data is crucial to assure their availability to all nodes because sparse population of nodes can lead to (frequent) network partitions. If these dynamic networks display a fairly stable cluster structure, it is possible to utilize this structure to improve service and data availability. However, clustering in a dynamic network is a very challenging task due to the ever-changing topology and irregular density of such a network. In this paper, we investigate clustering of dynamic networks with the help of community detection mechanisms, using only topology information from the local routing table. The main aim of our approach is to reduce to \"zero\" the communication overhead needed for cluster management and to dynamically adapt to the size and layout of the network. We have performed extensive experiments to evaluate the consistency, quality, and stability of the clustering returned by our algorithms. The results show that our nonintrusive clustering indeed discovers temporary groups of nodes that form stable clusters in the network. Moreover, even though the local routing tables in general reflect slightly diverging topologies, our results still show only small differences between the communities detected at different nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10221","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10221","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10221","fieldValue":"ACM"}
