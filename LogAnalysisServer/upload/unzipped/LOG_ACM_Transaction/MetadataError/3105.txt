Nearly all the top performing systems use heavy methods that require sophisticated techniques, such as parsers or logic provers. However, such techniques are usually unavailable or unaffordable for under-resourced languages or in resource-limited situations. In this article, we describe how a top-performing Chinese QA system can be designed by using lightweight methods effectively. We propose two lightweight methods, namely the Sum of Co-occurrences of Question and Answer Terms (SCO-QAT) and Alignment-based Surface Patterns (ABSPs). SCO-QAT is a co-occurrence-based answer-ranking method that does not need extra knowledge, word-ignoring heuristic rules, or tools. It calculates co-occurrence scores based on the passage retrieval results. ABSPs are syntactic patterns trained from question-answer pairs with a multiple alignment algorithm. They are used to capture the relations between terms and then use the relations to filter answers. We attribute the success of the ABSPs and SCO-QAT methods to the effective use of local syntactic information and global co-occurrence information. By using SCO-QAT and ABSPs, we improved the RU-Accuracy of our testbed QA system, ASQA, from 0.445 to 0.535 on the NTCIR-5 dataset. It also achieved the top 0.5 RU-Accuracy on the NTCIR-6 dataset. The result shows that lightweight methods are not only cheaper to implement, but also have the potential to achieve state-of-the-art performances."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2940","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2940","fieldValue":"ACM"}
