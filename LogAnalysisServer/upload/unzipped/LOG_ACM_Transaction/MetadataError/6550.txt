{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7452","fieldValue":" Nowadays, several location-based services (LBSs) allow their users to take advantage of information from the Web about points of interest (POIs) such as cultural events or restaurants. To the best of our knowledge, however, none of these provides information taking into account user preferences, or other elements, in addition to location, that contribute to define the context of use. The provided suggestions do not consider, for example, time, day of week, weather, user activity or means of transport. This article describes a social recommender system able to identify user preferences and information needs, thus suggesting personalized recommendations related to POIs in the surroundings of the user's current location. The proposed approach achieves the following goals: (i) to supply, unlike the current LBSs, a methodology for identifying user preferences and needs to be used in the information filtering process; (ii) to exploit the ever-growing amount of information from social networking, user reviews, and local search Web sites; (iii) to establish procedures for defining the context of use to be employed in the recommendation of POIs with low effort. The flexibility of the architecture is such that our approach can be easily extended to any category of POI. Experimental tests carried out on real users enabled us to quantify the benefits of the proposed approach in terms of performance improvement."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7453","fieldValue":" In recent years, different proposals have been made to exploit Social Web tagging information to build more effective recommender systems. The tagging data, for example, were used to identify similar users or were viewed as additional information about the recommendable items. Recent research has indicated that â\u20ACœattaching feelings to tagsâ\u20AC? is experienced by users as a valuable means to express which features of an item they particularly like or dislike. When following such an approach, users would therefore not only add tags to an item as in usual Web 2.0 applications, but also attach a preference (affect) to the tag itself, expressing, for example, whether or not they liked a certain actor in a given movie. In this work, we show how this additional preference data can be exploited by a recommender system to make more accurate predictions. In contrast to previous work, which also relied on so-called tag preferences to enhance the predictive accuracy of recommender systems, we argue that tag preferences should be considered in the context of an item. We therefore propose new schemes to infer and exploit context-specific tag preferences in the recommendation process. An evaluation on two different datasets reveals that our approach is capable of providing more accurate recommendations than previous tag-based recommender algorithms and recent tag-agnostic matrix factorization techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7453","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7453","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7454","fieldValue":"Chen, Yu-Chih"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7454","fieldValue":"Lin, Yu-Shi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7454","fieldValue":"Shen, Yu-Chun"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7454","fieldValue":"Lin, Shou-De"}
