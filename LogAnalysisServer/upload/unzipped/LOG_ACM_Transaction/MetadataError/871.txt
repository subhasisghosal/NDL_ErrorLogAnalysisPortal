{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13520","fieldValue":" The clock networks of many modern circuits have to operate in multiple corners and multiple modes (MCMM). We propose to construct mode-reconfigurable clock trees (MRCTs) based on mode separation and scenario compression. The technique of scenario compression is proposed to consider the timing constraints in multiple scenarios at the same time, compressing the MCMM problem into an equivalent single-corner multiple-mode (SCMM), or single-corner single-mode (SCSM) problem. The compression is performed by combining the skew constraints of the different scenarios in skew constraint graphs based on delay linearization and dominating skew constraints. An MRCT consists of several clock trees and mode separation involves, depending on the active mode, selecting one of the clock trees to deliver the clock signal. To limit the overhead, the bottom part (closer to the clock sinks) of all the different clock trees are shared and only the top part (closer to the clock source) of the clock network is mode reconfigurable. The reconfiguration is realized using OR-gates and a one-input-multiple-output demultiplexer. The experimental results show that for a set of synthesized MCMM circuits, with 715 to 13, 216 sequential elements, the proposed approach can achieve high yield."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13520","fieldValue":"Construction of Reconfigurable Clock Trees for MCMM Designs Using Mode Separation and Scenario Compression"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2290","fieldValue":" We study scheduling problems in battery-operated computing devices, aiming at schedules with low total energy consumption. While most of the previous work has focused on finding feasible schedules in deadline-based settings, in this article we are interested in schedules that guarantee good response times. More specifically, our goal is to schedule a sequence of jobs on a variable-speed processor so as to minimize the total cost consisting of the energy consumption and the total flow time of all jobs. We first show that when the amount of work, for any job, may take an arbitrary value, then no online algorithm can achieve a constant competitive ratio. Therefore, most of the article is concerned with unit-size jobs. We devise a deterministic constant competitive online algorithm and show that the offline problem can be solved in polynomial time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13521","fieldValue":" Wearables are being widely utilized in health and wellness applications, primarily due to the recent advances in sensor and wireless communication, which enhance the promise of wearable systems in providing continuous and real-time monitoring and interventions. Wearables are generally composed of hardware\/software components for collection, processing, and communication of physiological data. Practical implementation of wearable monitoring in real-life applications is currently limited due to notable obstacles. The wearability and form factor are dominated by the amount of energy needed for sensing, processing, and communication. In this article, we propose an ultra-low-power granular decision-making architecture, also called screening classifier, which can be viewed as a tiered wake-up circuitry, consuming three orders of magnitude-less power than the state-of-the-art low-power microcontrollers. This processing model operates based on computationally simple template matching modules, based on coarse- to fine-grained analysis of the signals with on-demand and gradually increasing the processing power consumption. Initial template matching rejects signals that are clearly not of interest from the signal processing chain, keeping the rest of processing blocks idle. If the signal is likely of interest, the sensitivity and the power of the template matching modules are gradually increased, and ultimately, the main processing unit is activated. We pose optimization techniques to efficiently split a full template into smaller bins, called mini-templates, and activate only a subset of bins during each classification decision. Our experimental results on real data show that this signal screening model reduces power consumption of the processing architecture by a factor of 70&percnt; while the sensitivity of detection remains at least 80&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13521","fieldValue":"ACM"}
