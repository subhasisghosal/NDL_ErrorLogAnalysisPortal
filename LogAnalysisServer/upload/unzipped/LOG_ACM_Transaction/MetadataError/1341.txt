However, despite (or maybe due to) its success and its widespread use, some aspects remain to be clarified with respect to its validity and robustness. This might be caused by the fact that the Phong method is based on geometric arguments, illumination models, and clever heuristics. In this article we address some of the fundamentals that underlie Phong shading, such as the computation of vertex normals for nonmanifold models and the adequacy of linear interpolation and we apply a new interpolation technique to achieve an efficient and qualitatively improve result."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15153","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15153","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15154","fieldValue":" Given a polyhedron, construct a new polyhedron by connecting every edge-midpoint to its four neighboring edge-midpoints.

One particularly useful representation is the rational parametrization, where the three spatial coordinates are given by rational functions of two parameters. These parametrizations take on different forms for different classes of cubic surfaces. Classification of real cubic algebraic surfaces into five families for the nonsingular case is based on the configuration of 27 lines on them. We provide a method of extracting all these lines by constructing and solving a polynomial of degree 27. Simple roots of this polynomial correspond to real lines on the surface, and real skew lines are used to form rational parametrizations for three of these families. Complex conjugate skew lines are used to parametrize surfaces from the fourth family. The parametrizations for these four families involve quotients of polynomials of degree no higher than four. Each of these parametrizations covers the whole surface except for a few points, lines, or conic sections. The parametrization for the fifth family, as noted previously in the literature, requires a square root. We also analyze the image of the derived rational parametrization for both real and complex parameter values, together with â\u20ACœbaseâ\u20AC? points where the parametrizations are ill-defined."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15155","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15155","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15156","fieldValue":"Kim, Myung-So"}
