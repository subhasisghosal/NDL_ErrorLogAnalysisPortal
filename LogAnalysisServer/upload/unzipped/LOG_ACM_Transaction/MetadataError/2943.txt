This article discusses the extraction of such semantically related entities (represented by domain terms) from biomedical literature. The method combines various text-based aspects, such as lexical, syntactic, and contextual similarities between terms. Lexical similarities are based on the level of sharing of word constituents. Syntactic similarities rely on expressions (such as term enumerations and conjunctions) in which a sequence of terms appears as a single syntactic unit. Finally, contextual similarities are based on automatic discovery of relevant contexts shared among terms. The approach is evaluated using the Genia resources, and the results of experiments are presented. Lexical and syntactic links have shown high precision and low recall, while contextual similarities have resulted in significantly higher recall with moderate precision. By combining the three metrics, we achieved F measures of 68&percnt; for semantically related terms and 37&percnt; for highly related entities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2895","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2895","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19797","fieldValue":" Although operators, which apply to functions to produce functions, prove very useful in mathematics, they are absent from most programming languages.

The latest increase has been achieved by duplication of arithmetic units for an array processor and the pipelining of functional units for vector processors. The high level programming languages for such machines have not benefited from the advances which have been made in programming language design and implementation techniques.A high level language is described in this paper which is appropriate for both array and vector processors and is defined without reference to the hardware of either type of machine. The syntax enables the parallel nature of a problem to be expressed in a form which can be readily exploited by these machines. This is achieved by using the data declarations to indicate the maximum extent of parallel processing and then to manipulate this, or a lesser extent, in the course of program execution. It was found to be possible to modify many of the structured programming and data structuring concepts for this type of parallel environment and to maintain the benefits of compile time and run time checking. Several special constructs and operators are also defined.The language offers to the large scale scientific computing community many of the advances which have been made in software engineering techniques while it exploits the architectural advances which have been made."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19798","fieldValue":"ACM"}
