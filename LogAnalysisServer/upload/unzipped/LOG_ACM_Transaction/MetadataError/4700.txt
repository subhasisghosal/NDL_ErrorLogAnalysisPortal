We focus on systems whose underlying stochastic process can be represented as a Generalized Semi-Markov Process (GSMP); a wide variety of stochastic systems fall within this framework. A fundamental stability requirement for an irreducible GSMP is that the states be â\u20ACœrecurrentâ\u20AC? in that the GSMP visits each state infinitely often with probability 1. We study recurrence properties of irreducible GSMPs with finite state space. Our focus is on the â\u20ACœclocksâ\u20AC? that govern the occurrence of events, and we consider GSMPs in which zero, one, or at least two simultaneously active events can have clock-setting distributions that are â\u20ACœheavy tailedâ\u20AC? in the sense that they have infinite mean. We establish positive recurrence, null recurrence, and, perhaps surprisingly, possible transience of states for these respective regimes. The transience result stands in strong contrast to Markovian or semi-Markovian GSMPs, where irreducibility and finiteness of the state space guarantee positive recurrence."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25135","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25135","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25136","fieldValue":" We provide the first algorithm that, under minimal assumptions, allows simulation of the stationary waiting-time sequence of a single-server queue backward in time, jointly with the input processes of the queue (interarrival and service times). The single-server queue is useful in applications of Dominated Coupling from the Past (DCFTP), which is a well-known protocol for simulation without bias from steady-state distributions. Our algorithm terminates in finite time, assuming only finite mean of the interarrival and service times. To simulate the single-server queue in stationarity until the first idle period in finite expected termination time, we require the existence of finite variance. This requirement is also necessary for such idle time (which is a natural coalescence time in DCFTP applications) to have finite mean. Thus, in this sense, our algorithm is applicable under minimal assumptions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25136","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25136","fieldValue":"ACM"}
