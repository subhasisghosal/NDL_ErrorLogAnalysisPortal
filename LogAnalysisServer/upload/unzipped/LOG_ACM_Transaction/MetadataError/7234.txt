A new minimum-power allocation algorithm is developed to minimize the interference experienced by a code channel such that heterogeneous bit-error rate (BER) requirements of multimedia traffic are satisfied. Further, from analysis of the maximum capacity of a time slot, it is concluded that both rate and BER scheduling are necessary to reach a maximum capacity. Based on the new minimum-power allocation algorithm as well as on rate and BER scheduling concepts, a new scheduling scheme is proposed to serve packets with heterogeneous BER and quality of service (QoS) requirements in different time slots. To further enhance the performance of the MAC protocol, an effective connection admission control (CAC) algorithm is developed based on the new minimum-power allocation algorithm. Simulation results show that the new wide-band TD-CDMA MAC protocol satisfies the QoS requirements of multimedia traffic and achieves high overall system throughput."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9286","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9286","fieldValue":"Wide-band TD-CDMA MAC with minimum-power allocation and rate- and BER-scheduling for wireless multimedia networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9286","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9286","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9287","fieldValue":"Gau, Rung-Hung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9287","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose to concurrently search for a number of mobile users in a wireless cellular network based on the probabilistic information about the locations of mobile users. The concurrent search approach guarantees that all k mobile users will be located within k time slots. It is shown that even in the worst case when mobile users appear equally in all the cells of the network, the concurrent search approach is able to reduce the average paging cost by 25%. More importantly, this is achieved without an increase in the worst case paging delay or in the worst case paging cost. Depending on the total number of mobile users to be located, total number of cells in the network, and the probabilistic information about the locations of mobile users, the reduction of the average paging cost due to the usage of the concurrent search approach ranges from 25% to 88%. The case in which perfect probabilistic information is unavailable is also studied."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9287","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
