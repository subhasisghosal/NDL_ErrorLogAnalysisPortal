The protocol uses signaling messages called cues to indicate events whose timing is significant to receivers, such as the start or stop time of a media program. We describe the implementation and operation of a prototype Internet radio station which transmits program cues in audio broadcasts using the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). A collection of simple yet powerful stream processing applications we implemented demonstrate how application creation is greatly eased when media streams are enriched with program cues."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9107","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9107","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9107","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9108","fieldValue":"Tse, David N C"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9108","fieldValue":" The capacity of ad hoc wireless networks is constrained by the mutual interference of concurrent transmissions between nodes. We study a model of an ad hoc network where n nodes communicate in random source-destination pairs. These nodes are assumed to be mobile. We examine the per-session throughput for applications with loose delay constraints, such that the topology changes over the time-scale of packet delivery. Under this assumption, the per-user throughput can increase dramatically when nodes are mobile rather than fixed. This improvement can be achieved by exploiting a form of multiuser diversity via packet relaying."}
