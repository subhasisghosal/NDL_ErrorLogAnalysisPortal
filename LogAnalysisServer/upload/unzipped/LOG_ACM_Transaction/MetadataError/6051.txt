Local computation mechanisms reply to each query in polylogarithmic time and space, and the replies to different queries are consistent with the same global feasible solution. When the mechanism employs payments, the computation of the payments is also done in polylogarithmic time and space. Furthermore, the mechanism needs to maintain incentive compatibility with respect to the allocation and payments. We present local computation mechanisms for two classical game-theoretical problems: stable matching and job scheduling. For stable matching, some of our techniques may have implications to the global (non-LCA (Local Computation Algorithm)) setting. Specifically, we show that when the menâ\u20AC™s preference lists are bounded, we can achieve an arbitrarily good approximation to the stable matching within a fixed number of iterations of the Gale-Shapley algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6069","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6069","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6070","fieldValue":" Incentives are more likely to elicit desired outcomes when they are designed based on accurate models of agentsâ\u20AC™ strategic behavior. A growing literature, however, suggests that people do not quite behave like standard economic agents in a variety of environments, both online and offline. What consequences might such differences have for the optimal design of mechanisms in these environments? In this article, we explore this question in the context of optimal contest design for simple agentsâ\u20AC\u201Dagents who strategically reason about whether or not to participate in a system, but not about the input they provide to it. Specifically, consider a contest where n potential contestants with types $(q_i$, $c^i) each choose between participating and producing a submission of quality qi at cost ci, versus not participating at all to maximize their utilities. How should a principal distribute a total prize V among the n ranks to maximize some increasing function of the qualities of elicited submissions in a contest with such simple agents? We first solve the optimal contest design problem for settings where agents have homogenous participation costs ci &equals; c. Here, the contest that maximizes every increasing function of the elicited contributions is always a simple contest, awarding equal prizes of V\/j&ast; each to the top j&ast;&equals;V\/c âˆ\u2019 Î˜(&sqrt;V\/(c ln (V\/c))) contestants. This is in contrast to the optimal contest structure in comparable models with strategic effort choices, where the optimal contest is either a winner-take-all contest or awards possibly unequal prizes, depending on the curvature of agentsâ\u20AC™ effort cost functions. We next address the general case with heterogenous costs where agentsâ\u20AC™ types (qi, ci$) are inherently two dimensional, significantly complicating equilibrium analysis. With heterogenous costs, the optimal contest depends on the objective being maximized: our main result here is that the winner-take-all contest is a 3-approximation of the optimal contest when the principalâ\u20AC™s objective is to maximize the quality of the best elicited contribution. The proof of this result hinges around a â\u20ACœsubequilibriumâ\u20AC? lemma establishing a stochastic dominance relation between the distribution of qualities elicited in an equilibrium and a subequilibriumâ\u20AC\u201Da strategy profile that is a best response for all agents who choose to participate in that strategy profile; this relation between equilibria and subequilibria may be of more general interest."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6070","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6070","fieldValue":"ACM"}
