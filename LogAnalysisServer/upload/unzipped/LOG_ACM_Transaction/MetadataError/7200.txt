To this end, an appropriate analytical framework is introduced which allows calculation of the performance statistically guaranteed to any flow out of an aggregate. This feature enables the analytical framework to be applied to the elements of the core network where aggregates of traffic are considered instead of single flows in order to avoid scalability problems. Given that flows are modeled in the analytical framework through switched batch Bernoulli processes (SBBPs), the whole queueing system is denoted as SBBP\/Sc\/1\/K. The performance is calculated in terms of loss probability and delay distribution. The proposed framework is applied in a significant multinode case study."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9220","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9220","fieldValue":"A novel analytical framework compounding statistical traffic modeling and aggregate-level service curve disciplines: network performance and efficiency implications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9221","fieldValue":" Building on the success of unicast IP, IP Multicast adopted a simple, open, best-effort delivery model with many-to-many semantics. Despite several years of effort, a general, scalable and reliable end-to-end transport protocol analogous to TCP has proven elusive. Proposed solutions are either inflexible, or incur high control overhead.We present Lightweight Multicast Services (LMS), which enhance the IP Multicast model with simple forwarding services to facilitate scalable and efficient (compared to pure end-to-end) solutions to problems such as reliable multicast. In LMS, routers tag and steer control packets to preselected endpoints and perform fine-grain multicast to guide responses to a subset of the group without transport-level processing.LMS divides error control into transport and forwarding components, which allows the former to remain at the end-points while the latter is pushed to the routers, where it can be implemented very efficiently. The division is clean, resulting in significant gains in performance and scalability, while reducing application complexity. LMS reaches beyond reliable multicast to applications such as scalable collect, any-cast, and in general, any application that can benefit from a hierarchy congruent with the underlying topology."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9221","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9221","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9221","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9222","fieldValue":" One approach to achieving scalability in reliable multicast is to use a hierarchy. A hierarchy can be established at the application level, or by using router-assist. With router-assist we have more fine-grain control over the placement of error-recovery functionality, therefore, a hierarchy produced by assistance from the routers is expected to have better performance. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by comparing two schemes, one that uses an application-level hierarchy (ALH) and another that uses router-assisted hierarchy (RAH). Contrary to our expectations, we find that the qualitative performance of ALH is comparable to RAH. We do not model the overhead of creating the hierarchy nor the cost of adding router-assist to the network. Therefore, our conclusions inform rather than close the debate of which approach is better."}
