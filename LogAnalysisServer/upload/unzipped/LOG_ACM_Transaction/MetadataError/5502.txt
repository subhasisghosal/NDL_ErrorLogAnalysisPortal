When conducting user-based evaluations, several cultural and linguistic characteristics of members of the American Deaf community must be taken into account so as to ensure the accuracy of evaluations involving these users. This article describes an implementation and user-based evaluation (by native ASL signers) of a prototype ASL natural language generation system that produces sentences containing classifier predicates, which are frequent and complex spatial phenomena that previous ASL generators have not produced. Native signers preferred the system's output to Signed English animations -- scoring it higher in grammaticality, understandability, and naturalness of movement. They were also more successful at a comprehension task after viewing the system's classifier predicate animations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4764","fieldValue":"huang, hong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4764","fieldValue":" A new manifold learning method, called parameter-free semi-supervised local Fisher discriminant analysis (pSELF), is proposed to map the gene expression data into a low-dimensional space for tumor classification. Motivated by the fact that semi-supervised and parameter-free are two desirable and promising characteristics for dimension reduction, a new difference-based optimization objective function with unlabeled samples has been designed. The proposed method preserves the global structure of unlabeled samples in addition to separating labeled samples in different classes from each other. The semi-supervised method has an analytic form of the globally optimal solution, which can be computed efficiently by eigen decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic data and SRBCT, DLBCL, and Brain Tumor gene expression data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4764","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4764","fieldValue":"Gene expression data, dimensionality reduction, semi-supervised local Fisher discriminant analysis, parameter free, uncorrelated constraint."}
