For better usage of existing resource-selection techniques, it is desirable to know what the fundamental differences between them are and in what settings one is superior to others. However, little is understood still about the actual behavior of resource-selection methods. In this work, we focus on small-document approaches to resource selection that rank and select sources based on the ranking of their documents. We pose a number of research questions and approach them by three types of analyses. First, we present existing small-document techniques in a unified framework and analyze them theoretically. Second, we propose using a qualitative analysis to study the behavior of different small-document approaches. Third, we present a novel experimental methodology to evaluate small-document techniques and to validate the results of the qualitative analysis. This way, we answer the posed research questions and provide insights about small-document methods in general and about each technique in particular."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24099","fieldValue":"Theoretical, Qualitative, and Quantitative Analyses of Small-Document Approaches to Resource Selection"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24100","fieldValue":" Many articles in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia have hyperlinks to ambiguous article titles; these ambiguous links should be replaced with links to unambiguous articles, a process known as disambiguation. We propose a novel statistical topic model based on link text, which we refer to as the Link Text Topic Model (LTTM), that we use to suggest new link targets for ambiguous links. To evaluate our model, we describe a method for extracting ground truth for this link disambiguation task from edits made to Wikipedia in a specific time period. We use this ground truth to demonstrate the superiority of LTTM over other existing link- and content-based approaches to disambiguating links in Wikipedia. Finally, we build a web service that uses LTTM to make suggestions to human editors wanting to fix ambiguous links in Wikipedia."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24100","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24100","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3342","fieldValue":" Earlier researchers were able to extract the transient facial thermal features from thermal infrared images (TIRIs) to make binary distinctions between the expressions of affective states. However, effective human-computer interaction would require machines to distinguish between the subtle facial expressions of affective states. This work, for the first time, attempts to use the transient facial thermal features for recognizing a much wider range of facial expressions. A database of 324 time-sequential, visible-spectrum, and thermal facial images was developed representing different facial expressions from 23 participants in different situations. A novel facial thermal feature extraction, selection, and classification approach was developed and invoked on various Gaussian mixture models constructed using: neutral and pretended happy and sad faces, faces with multiple positive and negative facial expressions, faces with neutral and six (pretended) basic facial expressions, and faces with evoked happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger. This work demonstrates that (1) infrared imaging can be used to observe the affective-state-specific facial thermal variations, (2) pixel-grey level analysis of TIRIs can help localise significant facial thermal feature points along the major facial muscles, and (3) cluster-analytic classification of transient thermal features can help distinguish between the facial expressions of affective states in an optimized eigenspace of input thermal feature vectors. The observed classification results exhibited influence of a Gaussian mixture model's structure on classifier-performance. The work also unveiled some pertinent aspects of future research on the use of facial thermal features in automated facial expression classification and affect recognition."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3342","fieldValue":"Classifying pretended and evoked facial expressions of positive and negative affective states using infrared measurement of skin temperature"}
