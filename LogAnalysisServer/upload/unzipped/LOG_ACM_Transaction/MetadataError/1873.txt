We computationally access such manifolds, typically of high dimension and co-dimension, through first and second order approximants, namely tangent spaces and quadratically parameterized osculant surfaces. Exploration and navigation of desirable subspaces of the shape space with regard to application specific quality measures are enabled using approximants that are intrinsic to the underlying manifold and directly computable in the parameter space of the osculant surface. We demonstrate our framework on shape spaces of planar quad (PQ) meshes, where each mesh face is constrained to be (nearly) planar, and circular meshes, where each face has a circumcircle. We evaluate our framework for navigation and design exploration on a variety of inputs, while keeping context specific properties such as fairness, proximity to a reference surface, etc."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16523","fieldValue":" We present an approach to segmenting shapes in a heterogenous shape database. Our approach segments the shapes jointly, utilizing features from multiple shapes to improve the segmentation of each. The approach is entirely unsupervised and is based on an integer quadratic programming formulation of the joint segmentation problem. The program optimizes over possible segmentations of individual shapes as well as over possible correspondences between segments from multiple shapes. The integer quadratic program is solved via a linear programming relaxation, using a block coordinate descent procedure that makes the optimization feasible for large databases. We evaluate the presented approach on the Princeton segmentation benchmark and show that joint shape segmentation significantly outperforms single-shape segmentation techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16524","fieldValue":"van Kaick, Oliver"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16524","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16524","fieldValue":" We introduce an algorithm for unsupervised co-segmentation of a set of shapes so as to reveal the semantic shape parts and establish their correspondence across the set. The input set may exhibit significant shape variability where the shapes do not admit proper spatial alignment and the corresponding parts in any pair of shapes may be geometrically dissimilar. Our algorithm can handle such challenging input sets since, first, we perform co-analysis in a descriptor space, where a combination of shape descriptors relates the parts independently of their pose, location, and cardinality. Secondly, we exploit a key enabling feature of the input set, namely, dissimilar parts may be \"linked\" through third-parties present in the set. The links are derived from the pairwise similarities between the parts' descriptors. To reveal such linkages, which may manifest themselves as anisotropic and non-linear structures in the descriptor space, we perform spectral clustering with the aid of diffusion maps. We show that with our approach, we are able to co-segment sets of shapes that possess significant variability, achieving results that are close to those of a supervised approach."}
