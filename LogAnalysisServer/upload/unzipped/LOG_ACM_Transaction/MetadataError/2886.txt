In this article, we provide a rounding error analysis of this method, which unlike previous studies is not restricted to binary floating-point arithmetic but holds for any radix Î². We show first that an asymptotically optimal bound on the relative error of this method is 2Î² u + $2u^2\/Î² - 2u2 &equals; 2u + 2\/Î² u2 + O(u3), where u &equals; 1\/2Î²1-p is the unit roundoff in radix Î² and precision p. Then we show that the possibility of removing the O(u2) term from this bound is governed by the radix parity and the tie-breaking strategy used for rounding: if Î² is odd or rounding is to nearest even, then the simpler bound 2u is obtained, while if Î² is even and rounding is to nearest away, then there exist floating-point inputs a, b, c, d that lead to a relative error larger than 2u + 2\/Î² u2 &mins; 4u3$. All these results hold provided underflows and overflows do not occur and under some mild assumptions on p satisfied by IEEE 754-2008 formats."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19435","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19435","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19436","fieldValue":"Dumas, Jean-Guillaume"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19436","fieldValue":" Bini-Capovani-Lotti-Romani approximate formula (or border rank) for matrix multiplication achieves a better complexity than Strassenâ\u20AC™s matrix multiplication formula.
