First, our approach converts a collection of expert-created designs to a dataset of parameterized design templates that includes all information necessary for fabrication. The templates are then used in an interactive design system to create new fabri-cable models in a design-by-example manner. A simple interface allows novice users to choose template parts from the database, change their parameters, and combine them to create new models. Using the information in the template database, the system can automatically position, align, and connect parts: the system accomplishes this by adjusting parameters, adding appropriate constraints, and assigning connectors. This process ensures that the created models can be fabricated, saves the user from many tedious but necessary tasks, and makes it possible for non-experts to design and create actual physical objects. To demonstrate our data-driven method, we present several examples of complex functional objects that we designed and manufactured using our system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17055","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17055","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2614","fieldValue":" The field of kernelization offers a rigorous way of studying the ubiquitous technique of data reduction and preprocessing for combinatorially hard problems. A widely accepted definition of useful data reduction is that of a polynomial kernelization where the output instance is guaranteed to be of size polynomial in some parameter of the input. The fairly recent development of a framework for kernelization lower bounds has made this notion even more attractive as we can now classify many problems into admitting or not admitting polynomial kernelizations. The central notion of the framework is that of a polynomial-time composition algorithm due to Bodlaender et al. (ICALP 2008, JSCC 2009): given t input instances, an or-composition algorithm returns a single-output instance with bounded parameter value that is yes if and only if one of t input instances is yes; it encodes the logical OR of the input instances. Based on a result of Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008, JSCC 2011), Bodlaender et al. show that an or-composition for an NP-hard problem rules out polynomial kernelizations for it unless NP ‚ä\u2020 coNP\/poly (which is known to imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy). It is implicit in the work of Fortnow and Santhanam that even co-nondeterministic composition algorithms suffice to rule out polynomial kernelizations. This was first observed in unpublished work of Chen and M√ºller, and it is an explicit conclusion of recent results by Dell and van Melkebeek (STOC 2010). However, in contrast to the numerous applications of deterministic composition, the added power of co-nondeterminism has not yet been harnessed to obtain kernelization lower bounds. In this work, we present the first example of how co-nondeterminism can help to make a composition algorithm. We study the existence of polynomial kernels for a Ramsey-type problem where, given a graph G and an integer k, the question is whether G contains an independent set or a clique of size at least k. It was asked by Rod Downey whether this problem admits a polynomial kernelization with respect to k; such a result would greatly speed up the computation of Ramsey numbers. We provide a co-nondeterministic composition based on embedding t instances into a single host graph H. The crux is that the host graph H needs to observe a bound of &ell; ‚àà O(log t) on both its maximum independent set and maximum clique size, while also having a cover of its vertex set by independent sets and cliques all of size &ell;; the co-nondeterministic composition is built around the search for such graphs. Thus, we show that, unless NP ‚ä\u2020 coNP\/poly, the problem does not admit a kernelization with polynomial size guarantee."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2614","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2614","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17056","fieldValue":" We propose an interactive, optimization-in-the-loop tool for designing inflatable structures. Given a target shape, the user draws a network of seams defining desired segment boundaries in 3D. Our method computes optimally-shaped flat panels for the segments, such that the inflated structure is as close as possible to the target while satisfying the desired seam positions. Our approach is underpinned by physics-based pattern optimization, accurate coarse-scale simulation using tension field theory, and a specialized constraint-optimization method. Our system is fast enough to warrant interactive exploration of different seam layouts, including internal connections, and their effects on the inflated shape. We demonstrate the resulting design process on a varied set of simulation examples, some of which we have fabricated, demonstrating excellent agreement with the design intent."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17056","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17056","fieldValue":"ACM"}
