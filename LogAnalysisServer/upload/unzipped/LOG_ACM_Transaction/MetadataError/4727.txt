{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25256","fieldValue":" In this article we study a smooth and efficient transport protocol for real-time video over wireless networks. The proposed scheme, named the video transport protocol (VTP), has a new and unique end-to-end rate control mechanism that aims to avoid drastic rate fluctuations while maintaining friendliness to legacy protocols. VTP is also equipped with an achieved rate estimation scheme and a loss discrimination algorithm, both end-to-end, to cope with random errors in wireless networks efficiently. We show by analysis that VTP preserves most of the convergence properties of AIMD and converges to its fair share fast. VTP is compared to two recent TCP friendly rate control (TFRC) extensions, namely TFRC Wireless and MULTFRC, in wired-cum-wireless scenarios in Ns-2. Results show that VTP excels in all tested scenarios in terms of smoothness, fairness, and opportunistic friendliness. VTP is also implemented to work with a video camera and an H.263 video codec as part of our hybrid testbed, where its good performance as a transport layer protocol is confirmed by measurement results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25257","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a novel approach for automatic music video summarization. The proposed summarization scheme is different from the current methods used for video summarization. The music video is separated into the music track and video track. For the music track, a music summary is created by analyzing the music content using music features, an adaptive clustering algorithm, and music domain knowledge. Then, shots in the video track are detected and clustered. Finally, the music video summary is created by aligning the music summary and clustered video shots. Subjective studies by experienced users have been conducted to evaluate the quality of music summaries and effectiveness of the proposed summarization approach. Experiments are performed on different genres of music videos and comparisons are made with the summaries generated based on music track, video track, and manually. The evaluation results indicate that summaries generated using the proposed method are effective in helping realize users' expectations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25257","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25257","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3439","fieldValue":"Abdul-Massih, Michel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3439","fieldValue":" Recent years have seen increasing research in perceptually-driven reductions in the costs of realistically rendered imagery. Water is complex and recognizable, and continues to be in the forefront of research. However, the contribution of individual lighting phenomena to the perceived realism of virtual water has not been addressed. All these phenomena have costs associated with their rendering, but does the visual benefit outweigh these costs&quest; This study investigates the human perception of various illumination components found in water-rich virtual environments. The investigation uses a traditional psychophysical analysis to examine viewer perception of these lighting phenomena as they relate to the rendering cost, and ultimately reveals common trends in perceptual value. Five different scenes with a wide range of water and lighting dynamics were tested for perceptual value by one hundred participants. Our results provide an importance comparison for lighting phenomena in the rendering of water, and cost reductions can be made with little or no effect on the perceived quality of the imagery if viewed in a scenario similar to our testing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3439","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3439","fieldValue":"ACM"}
