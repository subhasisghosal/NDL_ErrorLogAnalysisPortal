In this article we show that by storing selectively a much smaller set of routing paths in the routing tables one can get low-stretch, compact routing schemes. Our routing scheme includes an approximate distance oracle with which one can obtain approximate shortest path length estimates to destinations. This distance oracle can be obtained, for example, by a landmark-based scheme, or in case of sensor networks, from the geographic distance between node locations. With an approximate distance oracle one can attempt greedy routing by forwarding to the neighbor whose estimate is closer to the destination. But there is no guarantee of delivery nor of the routing path length. We augment the distance oracle by storing, for each node u, routing paths to $O(log^2 n) strategically selected nodes that serve as intermediate destinations. These nodes are selected with probability proportional to 1\/rÏ?, where r is the distance to u and Ï? is a suitable constant for the network. Then we derive a set of sufficient conditions to select the next step at each stage of routing, such that these conditions can be verified locally and guarantee 1&plus;&epsiv; stretch routing on any metric. These conditions serve as the â\u20ACœgreedy routingâ\u20AC? or local decision rule. On graphs of bounded growth, our scheme guarantees 1&plus;&epsiv; stretch routing with high probability, with an average routing table size of O(âˆšn log2$ n). This scheme is favorable for its simplicity, generality, and blindness to any global state. It demonstrates that global routing properties could emerge from purely distributed and uncoordinated routing table design."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21428","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2480730.2480735\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21428","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21428","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21429","fieldValue":" Most Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications require distributed signal and collaborative data processing. One of the critical issues for enabling collaborative processing in WSNs is how to schedule tasks in a systematic way, including assigning tasks to sensor nodes, and determining their execution and communication sequence. Since WSN nodes are very resource constrained, mainly regarding their energy supply, one major concern when scheduling tasks in such environments is to minimize and balance the energy consumption, so that the system operational lifetime is maximized. We propose a heuristic-based three-phase algorithm (TPTS) for allocating tasks to multiple clusters in hierarchical WSNs that aims at finding a scheduling scheme that minimizes the overall energy consumption and balances the workload of the system while meeting the application's deadline. The performance of the proposed algorithm and the effect of several parameters on its behavior were evaluated by simulations, with promising results. The experimental results show that the time and energy performance of TPTS are close to the time and energy of benchmarks in most cases, while load balance is always provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21429","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2480730.2480736\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21429","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21429","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21430","fieldValue":" For sensor networks deployed to monitor and report real events, event source anonymity is an attractive and critical security property, which unfortunately is also very difficult and expensive to achieve. This is not only because adversaries may attack against sensor source privacy through traffic analysis, but also because sensor networks are very limited in resources. As such, a practical trade-off between security and performance is desirable. In this article, for the first time we propose the notion of statistically strong source anonymity, under a challenging attack model where a global attacker is able to monitor the traffic in the entire network. We propose a scheme called FitProbRate, which realizes statistically strong source anonymity for sensor networks. We demonstrate the robustness of our scheme under various statistical tests that might be employed by the attacker to detect real events. Our analysis and simulation results show that our scheme, besides providing source anonymity, can significantly reduce real event reporting latency compared to two baseline schemes. However, the degree of source anonymity in the FitProbRate scheme might decrease as real message rate increases. We propose a dynamic mean scheme which has better performance under high real message rates. Simulation results show that the dynamic mean scheme is capable of increasing the attacker's false positive rate and decreasing the attacker's Bayesian detection rate significantly even under high-rate continuous real messages."}
