Redundancy elimination results in traffic reduction which in turn improves the efficiency of network links. In this paper, the concept of network compression is introduced that aspires to exploit the statistical correlation beyond removing large duplicate strings from the flow to better suppress redundancy. In the first part of the paper, we introduce \"memory-assisted compression,\" which utilizes the memorized content within the network to learn the statistics of the information source generating the packets which can then be used toward reducing the length of codewords describing the packets emitted by the source. Using simulations on data gathered from real network traces, we show that memory-assisted compression can result in significant traffic reduction. In the second part of the paper, we study the scaling of the average network-wide benefits of memory-assisted compression. We discuss routing and memory placement problems in network for the reduction of overall traffic. We derive a closed-form expression for the scaling of the gain in Erd≈\u2018s-R√©nyi random network graphs, where obtain a threshold value for the number of memories deployed in a random graph beyond which network-wide benefits start to shine. Finally, the network-wide benefits are studied on Internet-like scale-free networks. We show that non-vanishing network compression gain is obtained even when only a tiny fraction of the total number of nodes in the network are memory-enabled."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10915","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10915","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/10915","fieldValue":"Erd&odblac;s-R&eacute;nyi random graphs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10915","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10915","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10916","fieldValue":" Device-free object tracking provides a promising solution for many localization and tracking systems to monitor non-cooperative objects, such as intruders, which do not carry any transceiver. However, existing device-free solutions mainly use special sensors or active RFID tags, which are much more expensive compared to passive tags. In this paper, we propose a novel motion detection and tracking method using passive RFID tags, named Twins. The method leverages a newly observed phenomenon called critical state caused by interference among passive tags. We contribute to both theory and practice of this phenomenon by presenting a new interference model that precisely explains it and using extensive experiments to validate it. We design a practical Twins based intrusion detection system and implement a real prototype by commercial off-the-shelf RFID reader and tags. Experimental results show that Twins is effective in detecting the moving object, with very low location errors of 0.75 m in average (with a deployment spacing of 0.6 m)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10916","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10916","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}
