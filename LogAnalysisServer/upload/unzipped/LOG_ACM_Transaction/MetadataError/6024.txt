{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5999","fieldValue":" In this work, we study the degree to which small fluctuations in costs in well-studied potential games can impact the result of natural best-response and improved-response dynamics. We call this the Price of Uncertainty and study it in a wide variety of potential games including fair cost-sharing games, set-cover games, routing games, and job-scheduling games. We show that in certain cases, even extremely small fluctuations can have the ability to cause these dynamics to spin out of control and move to states of much higher social cost, whereas in other cases these dynamics are much more stable even to large degrees of fluctuation. We also consider the resilience of these dynamics to a small number of Byzantine players about which no assumptions are made. We show again a contrast between different games. In certain cases (e.g., fair cost-sharing, set-cover, job-scheduling) even a single Byzantine player can cause best-response dynamics to transition from low-cost states to states of substantially higher cost, whereas in others (e.g., the class of Î²-nice games, which includes routing, market-sharing and many others) these dynamics are much more resilient. Overall, our work can be viewed as analyzing the inherent resilience or safety of games to different kinds of imperfections in player behavior, player information, or in modeling assumptions made."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6000","fieldValue":"Agmon Ben-Yehuda, Orna"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6000","fieldValue":"Ben-Yehuda, Muli"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6000","fieldValue":" Cloud providers possessing large quantities of spare capacity must either incentivize clients to purchase it or suffer losses. Amazon is the first cloud provider to address this challenge, by allowing clients to bid on spare capacity and by granting resources to bidders while their bids exceed a periodically changing spot price. Amazon publicizes the spot price but does not disclose how it is determined. By analyzing the spot price histories of Amazonâ\u20AC™s EC2 cloud, we reverse engineer how prices are set and construct a model that generates prices consistent with existing price traces. Our findings suggest that usually prices are not market-driven, as sometimes previously assumed. Rather, they are likely to be generated most of the time at random from within a tight price range via a dynamic hidden reserve price mechanism. Our model could help clients make informed bids, cloud providers design profitable systems, and researchers design pricing algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6001","fieldValue":" This article considers markets mediated by autonomous self-interested comparison-shopping agents. As in todayâ\u20AC™s markets, the agents do not charge buyers for their services but rather benefit from payments obtained from sellers upon the execution of a transaction. The agents aim at maximizing their expected benefit, taking into consideration the cost incurred by the search and competition dynamics that arise in the multi-agent setting. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of such models, based on search theory principles. The analysis results in a characterization of the buyersâ\u20AC™ and agentsâ\u20AC™ search strategies in equilibrium. The main result of this article is that the use of self-interested comparison-shopping agents can result in a beneficial equilibrium, where both buyers and sellers benefit, in comparison to the case where buyers control the comparison-shopping agent, and the comparison-shopping agents necessarily do not lose. This, despite the fact that the service is offered for free to buyers and its cost is essentially covered by sellers. The analysis generalizes to any setting where buyers can use self-interested agents capable of effectively performing the search (e.g., evaluating opportunities) on their behalf."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6001","fieldValue":"ACM"}
