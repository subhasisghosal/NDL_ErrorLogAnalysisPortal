{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17477","fieldValue":" Multi-domain subspace simulation can efficiently and conveniently simulate the deformation of a large deformable body, by constraining the deformation of each domain into a different subspace. The key challenge in implementing this method is how to handle the coupling among multiple deformable domains, so that the overall effect is free of gap or locking issues. In this paper, we present a new domain decomposition framework that connects two disjoint domains through coupling elements. Under this framework, we present a unified simulation system that solves subspace deformations and rigid motions of all of the domains by a single linear solve. Since the coupling elements are part of the deformable body, their elastic properties are the same as the rest of the body and our system does not need stiffness parameter tuning. To quickly evaluate the reduced elastic forces and their Jacobian matrices caused by the coupling elements, we further develop two cubature optimization schemes using uniform and non-uniform cubature weights. Our experiment shows that the whole system can efficiently handle large and complex scenes, many of which cannot be easily simulated by previous techniques without limitations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17478","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose a full featured and efficient subspace simulation method in the rotation-strain (RS) space for elastic objects. Sharply different from previous methods using the rotation-strain space, except for the ability to handle non-linear elastic materials and external forces, our method correctly formulates the kinetic energy, centrifugal and Coriolis forces which significantly reduces the dynamic artifacts. We show many techniques used in the Euclidean space methods, such as modal derivatives, polynomial and cubature approximation, can be adapted to our RS simulator. Carefully designed experiments show that the equation of motion in RS space has less non-linearity than its Euclidean counterpart, and as a consequence, our method has great advantages of lower dimension and computational complexity than state-of-the-art methods in the Euclidean space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17479","fieldValue":" Model reduction has popularized itself for simulating elastic deformation for graphics applications. While these techniques enjoy orders-of-magnitude speedups at runtime simulation, the efficiency of precomputing reduced subspaces remains largely over-looked. We present a complete system of precomputation pipeline as a faster alternative to the classic linear and nonlinear modal analysis. We identify three bottlenecks in the traditional model reduction precomputation, namely modal matrix construction, cubature training, and training dataset generation, and accelerate each of them. Even with complex deformable models, our method has achieved orders-of-magnitude speedups over the traditional precomputation steps, while retaining comparable runtime simulation quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17480","fieldValue":" We present a model-reduced variational Eulerian integrator for incompressible fluids, which combines the efficiency gains of dimension reduction, the qualitative robustness of coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of geometric integrators, and the simplicity of sub-grid accurate boundary conditions on regular grids to deal with arbitrarily-shaped domains. At the core of our contributions is a functional map approach to fluid simulation for which scalar- and vector-valued eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator can be easily used as reduced bases. Using a variational integrator in time to preserve liveliness and a simple, yet accurate embedding of the fluid domain onto a Cartesian grid, our model-reduced fluid simulator can achieve realistic animations in significantly less computational time than full-scale non-dissipative methods but without the numerical viscosity from which current reduced methods suffer. We also demonstrate the versatility of our approach by showing how it easily extends to magnetohydrodynamics and turbulence modeling in 2D, 3D and curved domains."}
