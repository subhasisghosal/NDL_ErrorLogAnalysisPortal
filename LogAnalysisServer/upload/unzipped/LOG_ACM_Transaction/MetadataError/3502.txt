Utilizing the methodology of potential field in physics, in this article we effectively address the challenges of real-time routing in WSNs. In particular, based on a virtual composite potential field, we propose the Potential-based Real-Time Routing (PRTR) protocol that supports real-time routing using multipath transmission. PRTR minimizes delay for real-time traffic and alleviates possible congestions simultaneously. Since the delay bounds of real-time flows are extremely important, the end-to-end delay bound for a single flow is derived based on the Network Calculus theory. The simulation results show that PRTR minimizes the end-to-end delay for real-time routing, and also guarantees a tight bound on the delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21431","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2480730.2480738\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21431","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21431","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21432","fieldValue":" This article presents a scalable algorithm for managing property information about moving objects tracked by a sensor network. Property information is obtained via distributed sensor observations, but will be corrupted when objects mix up with each other. The association between properties and objects then becomes ambiguous. We build a novel representation framework, exploiting an overcomplete Radon basis dictionary to model property uncertainty in such circumstances. By making use of the combinatorial structure of the basis design and sparse representations we can efficiently approximate the underlying probability distribution of the association between target properties and tracks, overcoming the exponential space that would otherwise be required. Based on the proposed theories, we design a fully distributed algorithm on wireless sensor networks. We conduct comparative simulations and the results validate the effectiveness of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21432","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2480730.2480739\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21432","fieldValue":"ACM"}
