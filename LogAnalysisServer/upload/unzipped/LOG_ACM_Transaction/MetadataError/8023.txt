We have witnessed the successful deployment of commercial systems with content delivery network (CDN)- or peer-to-peer-based engines. While each being effective in certain aspects, having an all-round scalable, reliable, responsive, and cost-effective solution remains an illusive goal. Moreover, today's live streaming services have become highly globalized, with subscribers from all over the world. Such a globalization makes user behaviors and demands even more diverse and dynamic, further challenging state-of-the-art system designs. The emergence of cloud computing, however, sheds new light into this dilemma. Leveraging the elastic resource provisioning from the cloud, we present Cloud-Assisted Live Media Streaming (CALMS), a generic framework that facilitates a migration to the cloud. CALMS adaptively leases and adjusts cloud server resources in a fine granularity to accommodate temporal and spatial dynamics of demands from live streaming users. We present optimal solutions to deal with cloud servers with diverse capacities and lease prices, as well as the potential latencies in initiating and terminating leases in real-world cloud platforms. Our solution well accommodates location heterogeneity, mitigating the impact from user globalization. It also enables seamless migration for existing streaming systems, e.g., peer-to-peer, and fully explores their potentials. Simulations with data traces from both cloud service providers (Amazon EC2 and SpotCloud) and a live streaming service provider (PPTV) demonstrate that CALMS effectively mitigates the overall system deployment costs and yet provides users with satisfactory streaming latency and rate."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10867","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10867","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10867","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10868","fieldValue":"Khouzani, M.

Platform diversity, contact list utilization by the malware, clustering in the network structure, etc., can also lead to differing spreading rates. In this paper, a general formal framework is proposed for leveraging such heterogeneity to derive optimal patching policies that attain the minimum aggregate cost due to the spread of malware and the surcharge of patching. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle for a stratified epidemic model, it is analytically proven that in the mean-field deterministic regime, optimal patch disseminations are simple single-threshold policies. These policies are amenable to implementation and can serve as benchmarks for policies that have less knowledge of the network. Through numerical simulations, the behavior of optimal patching policies is investigated in sample topologies, and their advantages are demonstrated."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10868","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
