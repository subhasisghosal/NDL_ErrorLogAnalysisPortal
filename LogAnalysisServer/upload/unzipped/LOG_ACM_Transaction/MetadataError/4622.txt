{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3413","fieldValue":" Despite many recent developments in virtual reality, an effective locomotion interface which allows for normal walking through large virtual environments was until recently still lacking. Here, we describe the new CyberWalk omnidirectional treadmill system, which makes it possible for users to walk endlessly in any direction, while never leaving the confines of the limited walking surface. The treadmill system improves on previous designs, both in its mechanical features and in the control system employed to keep users close to the center of the treadmill. As a result, users are able to start walking, vary their walking speed and direction, and stop walking as they would on a normal, stationary surface. The treadmill system was validated in two experiments, in which both the walking behavior and the performance in a basic spatial updating task were compared to that during normal overground walking. The results suggest that walking on the CyberWalk treadmill is very close to normal walking, especially after some initial familiarization. Moreover, we did not find a detrimental effect of treadmill walking in the spatial updating task. The CyberWalk system constitutes a significant step forward to bringing the real world into the laboratory or workplace."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3413","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3413","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24947","fieldValue":" We demonstrate that a majority of modern random number generators, such as the newest version of rand.c, ranlux, and combined multiple recursive generators, have some manifest correlations in their outputs if the initial state is filled up using another linear recurrence with similar modulus. Among 58 available generators in the GNU scientific library, 40 show such defects. This is not because of the recursion, but because of carelessly chosen initialization schemes in the implementations. A good initialization scheme eliminates this phenomenon."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24947","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24947","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24948","fieldValue":" Predictive contract mechanisms such as dead reckoning are widely employed to support scalable remote entity modeling in distributed interactive applications (DIAs). By employing a form of controlled inconsistency, a reduction in network traffic is achieved. However, by relying on the distribution of instantaneous derivative information, dead reckoning trades remote extrapolation accuracy for low computational complexity and ease-of-implementation. In this article, we present a novel extension of dead reckoning, termed neuro-reckoning, that seeks to replace the use of instantaneous velocity information with predictive velocity information in order to improve the accuracy of entity position extrapolation at remote hosts. Under our proposed neuro-reckoning approach, each controlling host employs a bank of neural network predictors trained to estimate future changes in entity velocity up to and including some maximum prediction horizon. The effect of each estimated change in velocity on the current entity position is simulated to produce an estimate for the likely position of the entity over some short time-span. Upon detecting an error threshold violation, the controlling host transmits a predictive velocity vector that extrapolates through the estimated position, as opposed to transmitting the instantaneous velocity vector. Such an approach sì³®ds in reducing the spatial error associated with remote extrapolation of entity state. Consequently, a further reduction in network traffic can be achieved. Simulation results conducted using several human users in a highly interactive DIA indicate significant potential for improved scalability when compared to the use of IEEE DIS standard dead reckoning. Our proposed neuro-reckoning framework exhibits low computational resource overhead for real-time use and can be seamlessly integrated into many existing dead reckoning mechanisms."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24948","fieldValue":"Multistep-ahead neural-network predictors for network traffic reduction in distributed interactive applications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24948","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24948","fieldValue":"ACM"}
