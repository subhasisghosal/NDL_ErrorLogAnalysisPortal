{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13156","fieldValue":" In recent years, fabrication technology of CMOS has scaled to nanometer dimensions. As scaling progresses, several new challenges follow. Among them, the most noticeable two are process variations and leakage current of the circuit. To tackle the problems of process variations and leakage current, an effective way is to use a body-biasing technique. In substance, using the RBB technique can minimize leakage current but increase the delay of a gate. Contrary to RBB, the FBB technique decreases the delay but increases leakage current of a gate. In the previous work, a single body-biasing is applied to the whole circuit. In a slow circuit, since the FBB is applied to the whole circuit, the leakage current of all gates in the circuit increases dramatically. On the other hand, in a fast circuit, RBB is applied to decrease the leakage current. However, without violating the timing specification, the value of body-biasing is restricted by the critical paths, and the saving of leakage current is limited. In this article, we propose a design flow to partition the circuit into subcircuits so that each subcircuit can be applied its individual RBB or FBB. Experiments show that our method is able to save leakage current from 42&percnt; to 47&percnt; as compared to designs not using a body-biasing technique. Under process variations, our method can save 42&percnt; to 49&percnt; leakage on fast circuits and 20&percnt; to 35&percnt; on slow circuits."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13157","fieldValue":" The aggressive scaling of technology has not only accentuated the effects of intradie parametric variations in devices, but it has also impacted the effects of optimizing a certain performance metric on the optimality of other metrics. Thus, there is a need for optimization methods that can perform the simultaneous optimization of multiple metrics considering the effects of process variations. In this article, a novel variation-aware gate sizing framework has been developed that can perform simultaneous optimization of multiple performance metrics. In this framework, the relationships between the optimization metrics (like dynamic power, leakage power, and crosstalk noise) are modeled as a function of the gate sizes in the objective function. The delay values obtained from unconstrained delay optimization and the noise margins derived from coupling capacitance information form the constraints for the multimetric optimization problem. As an abstract framework, it is independent of the type of mathematical programming approach as well as the metrics chosen to be optimized. The framework has been implemented using a mathematical programming approach and has been tested on ITC'99 benchmarks for different combinations of multimetric and single-metric optimizations of delay, dynamic power, leakage power, and crosstalk noise. The results indicate that the framework identifies good solution points, and is efficient for postlayout optimization via gate sizing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13157","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13157","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13158","fieldValue":" The problem of optimal space allocation among interconnect wires in a VLSI layout, in order to minimize the switching power consumption and the average signal delay, is addressed in this article. We define a Weighted Power-Delay Sum (WPDS) objective function and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal interwire space allocation, based on the notion of capacitance density. At the optimum, every wire must be in equilibrium of its line-to-line weighted capacitance density on its two opposite sides, and the WPDS of the whole circuit is minimal if and only if capacitance density is uniformly distributed across the entire layout. This condition is shown to be equivalent to all paths of the layout cross-capacitance graph having the same length and all cuts having the same flow. An implementation which has been used in the design of a recent commercial high-end microprocessor and yielded 17&percnt; power reduction and 9&percnt; delay reduction in top-level interconnects is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13158","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13158","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2253","fieldValue":"Chern, Hua-Huai"}
