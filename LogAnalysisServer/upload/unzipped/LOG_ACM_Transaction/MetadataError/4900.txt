Stereoscopic images and video taken from the 3D mobile devices are uncomfortable for 3D viewing experiences due to the limited hardware for stereoscopic 3D stabilization. The existing stereoscopic 3D stabilization methods are computationally inefficient for the 3D mobile devices. In this article, we point out that this critical issue deteriorates the 3D viewing experiences on the 3D mobile devices. To improve visual comfort, we propose an efficient and effective algorithm to stabilize the stereoscopic images and video for the 3D mobile devices. To rectify the video jitter, we use the gyroscope and accelerometer embedded on the mobile devices to obtain the geometry information of the cameras. Using a different method than video-content-based motion estimation, our algorithm based on the gyroscope and acceleration data can achieve higher accuracy to effectively stabilize the video. Therefore, our approach is robust in video stabilization even under poor lighting and substantial foreground motion. Our algorithm outperforms previous approaches in not only smaller running time but also the better comfort of the stereoscopic 3D visualization for the 3D mobile devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25713","fieldValue":" Augmented reality (AR) aims to render the world that users see and overlay information that reflects the real physical dynamics. The digital view could be potentially projected near the Point-of-Interest (POI) in a way that makes the virtual view attached to the POI even when the camera moves. Achieving smooth support for movements is a subject of extensive studies. One of the key problems is where the augmented information should be added to the field of vision in real time. Existing solutions either leverage GPS location for rendering outdoor AR views (hundreds of kilometers away) or rely on image markers for small-scale presentation (only for the marker region). To realize AR applications under various scales and dynamics, we propose a suite of algorithms for fine-grained AR view tracking to improve the accuracy of attitude and displacement estimation, reduce the drift, eliminate the marker, and lower the computation cost. Instead of requiring extremely high, accurate, absolute locations, we propose multimodal solutions according to mobility levels without additional hardware requirement. Experimental results demonstrate significantly less error in projecting and tracking the AR view. These results are expected to make users excited to explore their surroundings with enriched content."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25713","fieldValue":"INS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25713","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25713","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25714","fieldValue":" Augmented reality (AR) applications have recently become popular on modern smartphones. We explore the effectiveness of this mobile AR technology in the context of grocery shopping, in particular as a means to assist shoppers in making healthier decisions as they decide which grocery products to buy. We construct an AR-assisted mobile grocery-shopping application that makes real-time, customized recommendations of healthy products to users and also highlights products to avoid for various types of health concerns, such as allergies to milk or nut products, low-sodium or low-fat diets, and general caloric intake. We have implemented a prototype of this AR-assisted mobile grocery shopping application and evaluated its effectiveness in grocery store aisles. Our application's evaluation with typical grocery shoppers demonstrates that AR overlay tagging of products reduces the search time to find healthy food items, and that coloring the tags helps to improve the user's ability to quickly and easily identify recommended products, as well as products to avoid. We have evaluated our application's functionality by analyzing the data we collected from 15 in-person actual grocery-shopping subjects and 104 online application survey participants."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25714","fieldValue":"ACM"}
