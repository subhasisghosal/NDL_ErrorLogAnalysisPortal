{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9658","fieldValue":" Recent measurements show that BGP peering links can fail as frequently as intradomain links and usually for short periods of time. We propose a new fast-reroute technique where routers are prepared to react quickly to interdomain link failures. For each of its interdomain links, a router precomputes a protection tunnel, i.e., an IP tunnel to an alternate nexthop which can reach the same destinations as via the protected link.We propose a BGP-based auto-discovery technique that allows each router to learn the candidate protection tunnels for its links. Each router selects the best protection tunnels for its links and when it detects an interdomain link failure, it immediately encapsulates the packets to send them through the protection tunnel. Our solution is applicable for the links between large transit ISPs and also for the links between multi-homed stub networks and their providers. Furthermore, we show that transient forwarding loops (and thus the corresponding packet losses) can be avoided during the routing convergence that follows the deactivation of a protection tunnel in BGP\/MPLS VPNs and in IP networks using encapsulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9658","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9658","fieldValue":"BGP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9658","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9658","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9659","fieldValue":" Routing optimization provides network operators with a powerful method for traffic engineering. Its general objective is to distribute traffic flows evenly across available network resources in order to avoid network congestion and quality of service degradation. In this paper we consider routing optimization based on conventional routing protocols where packets are forwarded hop-by-hop in a destination-based manner. Unlike other work in this area, we consider routing protocols, which are able to take into account concave routing metrics in addition to additive ones. The concave link metric introduces an additional degree of freedom for routing optimization, thus, increasing its optimization potential. We present and evaluate a mixed-integer programming model, which works on these metrics. This model unifies the optimization for single-metric and dual-metric routing concepts and also includes the consideration of multipath routing. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm usable for larger network instances. Numerical results indicate that employment of both the dual-metric concept and multipath routing can achieve considerably better utilization results than default-configured single-metric routing. A significant finding is that metric-based routing optimization with two link metrics often comes close to the results obtainable by optimization of arbitrarily configurable routing."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9659","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9659","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9659","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9660","fieldValue":" A conventional video file contains a single temporally-ordered sequence of video frames. Clients requesting on-demand streaming of such a file receive (all or intervals of) the same content. For popular files that receive many requests during a file playback time, scalable streaming protocols based on multicast or broadcast have been devised. Such protocols require server and network bandwidth that grow much slower than linearly with the file request rate. This paper considers \"nonlinear\" video content in which there are parallel sequences of frames. Clients dynamically select which branch of the video they wish to follow, sufficiently ahead of each branch point so as to allow the video to be delivered without jitter. An example might be \"choose-your-own-ending\" movies. With traditional scalable delivery architectures such as movie theaters or TV broadcasting, such personalization of the delivered video content is very difficult or impossible. It becomes feasible, in principle at least, when the video is streamed to individual clients over a network. For on-demand streaming of nonlinear media, this paper analyzes the minimal server bandwidth requirements, and proposes and evaluates practical scalable delivery protocols."}
