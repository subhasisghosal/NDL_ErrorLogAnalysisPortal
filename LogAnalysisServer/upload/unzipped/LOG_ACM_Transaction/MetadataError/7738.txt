{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10287","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been increasingly available for critical applications such as security surveillance and environmental monitoring. An important performance measure of such applications is sensing coverage that characterizes how well a sensing field is monitored by a network. Although advanced collaborative signal processing algorithms have been adopted by many existing WSNs, most previous analytical studies on sensing coverage are conducted based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of sensing. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploring the fundamental limits of coverage based on stochastic data fusion models that fuse noisy measurements of multiple sensors. We derive the scaling laws between coverage, network density, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We show that data fusion can significantly improve sensing coverage by exploiting the collaboration among sensors when several physical properties of the target signal are known. In particular, for signal path loss exponent ofk (typically between 2.0 and 5.0), Ï?f = $O(Ï?d^1-1\/k$)where Ï?f and Ï?d are the densities of uniformly deployed sensors that achieve full coverage under the fusion and disc models, respectively. Moreover, data fusion can also reduce network density for regularly deployed networks and mobile networks where mobile sensors can relocate to fill coverage holes. Our results help understand the limitations of the previous analytical results based on the disc model and provide key insights into the design of WSNs that adopt data fusion algorithms. Our analyses are verified through extensive simulations based on both synthetic data sets and data traces collected in a real deployment for vehicle detection."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10287","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10288","fieldValue":" According to several studies, the power consumption of the Internet accounts for up to 10% of theworldwide energy consumption and is constantly increasing. The global consciousness on this problem has also grown, and several initiatives are being put into place to reduce the power consumption of the ICT sector in general. In this paper, we face the problem of minimizing power consumption for Internet service provider (ISP) networks. In particular, we propose and assess strategies to concentrate network traffic on a minimal subset of network resources. Given a telecommunication infrastructure, our aim is to turn off network nodes and links while still guaranteeing full connectivity and maximum link utilization constraints. We first derive a simple and complete formulation, which results into an NP-hard problem that can be solved only for trivial cases. We then derive more complex formulations that can scale up to middle-sized networks. Finally, we provide efficient heuristics that can be used for large networks. We test the effectiveness of our algorithms on both real and synthetic topologies, considering the daily fluctuations of Internet traffic and different classes of users. Results show that the power savings can be significant, e.g., larger than 35%."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10288","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10288","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10288","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10289","fieldValue":"Lewin-Eytan, Liane"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10289","fieldValue":" A major problem in wireless networks is coping with limited resources, such as bandwidth and energy. These issues become a major algorithmic challenge in view of the dynamic nature of the wireless domain. We consider in this paper the single-transmitter power assignment problem under time-varying channels, with the objective of maximizing the data throughput. It is assumed that the transmitter has a limited power budget, to be sequentially divided during the lifetime of the battery. We deviate from the classic work in this area, which leads to explicit \"water-filling\" solutions, by considering a realistic scenario where the channel state quality changes arbitrarily from one transmission to the other. The problem is accordingly tackled within the framework of competitive analysis, which allows for worst-case performance guarantees in setups with arbitrarily varying channel conditions. We address both a \"discrete\" case, where the transmitter can transmit only at a fixed power level, and a \"continuous\" case, where the transmitter can choose any power level out of a bounded interval. For both cases, we propose online power-allocation algorithms with proven worst-case performance bounds. In addition, we establish lower bounds on the worst-case performance of any online algorithm and show that our proposed algorithms are optimal."}
