In order to move this hurdle, an increasing number of traditional media streaming applications have migrated from a private server cluster onto the cloud. With the elastic resource provisioning and centralized management of the cloud, the operational costs of media streaming application providers can decrease dramatically. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing migration solutions do not fully take viewer information such as hardware condition into consideration. In this article, we consider the deployment optimization problem named ODP by leveraging local memories at each viewer. Considering the NP-hardness of calculating the optimal solution, we turn to propose computationally tractable algorithms. Specifically, we unfold the original problem into two interactive subproblems: coarse-grained migration subproblem and fine-grained scheduling subproblem. Then, the corresponding offline approximation algorithms with performance guarantee and computational efficiency are given. The results of extensive evaluation show that compared with the baseline algorithm without leveraging local memories at viewers, our proposed algorithms and their online versions can decrease total bandwidth reservation and enhance the utilization of bandwidth reservation dramatically."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25772","fieldValue":"A Deployment Optimization Scheme Over Multimedia Big Data for Large-Scale Media Streaming Application"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25773","fieldValue":" Multimedia has been exponentially increasing as the biggest big data, which consist of video clips, images, and audio files. Processing and analyzing them on a cloud data center have become a preferred solution that can utilize the large pool of cloud resources to address the problems caused by the tremendous amount of unstructured multimedia data. However, there exist many challenges in processing multimedia big data on a cloud data center, such as multimedia data representation approach, an efficient networking model, and an estimation method for traffic patterns. The primary purpose of this article is to develop a novel tensor-based software-defined networking model on a cloud data center for multimedia big-data computation and communication. First, an overview of the proposed framework is provided, in which the functions of the representative modules are briefly illustrated. Then, three models,â\u20AC\u201Dforwarding tensor, control tensor, and transition tensorâ\u20AC\u201Dare proposed for management of networking devices and prediction of network traffic patterns. Finally, two algorithms about single-mode and multimode tensor eigen-decomposition are developed, and the incremental method is employed for efficiently updating the generated eigen-vector and eigen-tensor. Experimental results reveal that the proposed framework is feasible and efficient to handle multimedia big data on a cloud data center."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25773","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25773","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25774","fieldValue":" Device-to-device (D2D) communication, which utilizes mobile devices located within close proximity for direct connection and data exchange, holds great promise for improving energy and spectrum efficiency of mobile multimedia in 5G networks. It has been observed that most available D2D-based worksâ\u20AC\u201Dconsidered only the single-cell scenario with a single BS. Such scenario-based schemes, although tractable and able to illustrate the relationship between D2D links and cellular links, failed to take into account the distribution of surrounding base stations and user equipments (UEs), as well as the accumulated interference from ongoing transmissions in other cells. Furthermore, the single-tier network with one BS considered in available works is far from the real 5G scenario in which multi-tier BSs are heterogeneously distributed among the whole network area. In light of such observations, we present in this article a model for network coverage probability and average rate analysis in a D2D communication overlaying a two-tier downlink cellular network, where nineteen macro base stations (MBSs) with pico base stations (PBSs) placed at the end point of macro cell (hexagons) borders are employed according to the 3GPP specifications, and mobile users are spatially distributed according to the homogeneous Poisson Point Process model. Each mobile UE is able to establish a D2D link with adjacent UEs or connect to a nearby macro or pico base station. Stochastic geometric analysis is adopted to characterize the intratier interference distribution within the MBS-tier, PBS-tier, and D2D-tier based on which network coverage probability and per-user average rate are derived with a careful consideration of important issues such as threshold value, SINR value, user density, content hit rate, spectrum allocation, and cell coverage range. Our results show that, even for the overlaying case, D2D communication can significantly improve network coverage probability and per-user average downlink rate. Another finding is that the frequency allocation for D2D communications should be carefully tuned according to network settings, which may result in totally different varying behaviors for the per-user average rate."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25774","fieldValue":"5G"}
