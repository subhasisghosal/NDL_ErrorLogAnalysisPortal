This paper presents the design and analysis of an array of higher order microphones that uses 2D wavefield translation to provide a mode matching solution to the height invariant recording problem. It is shown that the use of $M$th order microphones significantly reduces the number of microphone units by a factor of $1\/(2M + 1)$ at the expense of increased complexity at each microphone unit. Robustness of the proposed array is also analyzed based on the condition number of the translation matrix while discussing array configurations that result in low condition numbers. The white-noise gain (WNG) of the array is then derived to verify that improved WNG can be achieved when the translation matrix is well conditioned. Furthermore, the arrayâ\u20AC™s performance is studied for interior soundfield recording as well as exterior soundfield recording using appropriate simulation examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3635","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3635","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3636","fieldValue":"Wei, Wen-Li"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3636","fieldValue":"Wu, Chung-Hsien"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3636","fieldValue":"Lin, Jen-Chun"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3636","fieldValue":" Determining how a speaker is engaged in a conversation is crucial for achieving harmonious interaction between computers and humans. In this study, a fusion approach was developed based on psychological factors to recognize Interaction Style ($IS$ ) in spoken conversation, which plays a key role in creating natural dialogue agents. The proposed Fused Cross-Correlation Model (FCCM) provides a unified probabilistic framework to model the relationships among the psychological factors of emotion, personality trait ($PT$), transient $IS$, and $IS$ history, for recognizing $IS$. An emotional arousal-dependent speech recognizer was used to obtain the recognized spoken text for extracting linguistic features to estimate transient $IS$ likelihood and recognize $PT$. A temporal course modeling approach and an emotional sub-state language model, based on the temporal phases of an emotional expression, were employed to obtain a better emotion recognition result. The experimental results indicate that the proposed FCCM yields satisfactory results in $IS$ recognition and also demonstrate that combining psychological factors effectively improves $IS$ recognition accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3636","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3636","fieldValue":"ACM"}
