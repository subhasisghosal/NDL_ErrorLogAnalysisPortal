To facilitate such experimentations, this paper presents MAYA, a multiparadigm network modeling framework including discrete event models, analytical models and physical network interfaces, together with its illustrative implementation using QualNet, fluid flow TCP model and physical network interface. MAYA framework allows users to interface simulated networks directly with physical networks, while attaining real-time constraints even for large-scale networks by incorporating above multiparadigm network modeling techniques. It also gives user the flexibility to emulate applications on nodes in both real and simulated networks. Experiments are conducted to validate the interoperation of QualNet and fluid flow model, to examine the performance of MAYA as well as to evaluate the optimization techniques, namely interleaved execution of fluid flow model and causality-preserve realtime synchronization relaxation. Experimental results indicate that MAYA is a scalable and extensible solution to modeling of close interactions between real application and network dynamics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24898","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24898","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3408","fieldValue":" In this work, we present a method of â\u20ACœWalking In Placeâ\u20AC? (WIP) on the Nintendo Wii Fit Balance Board to explore a virtual environment. We directly compare our method to joystick locomotion and normal walking. The joystick proves inferior to physically walking and to WIP on the Wii Balance Board (WIP--Wii). Interestingly, we find that physically exploring an environment on foot is equivalent in terms of spatial orientation to exploring an environment using our WIP--Wii method. This implies that the WIP--Wii is a good inexpensive alternative to exploring a virtual environment and it may be well--suited for exploring large virtual environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24899","fieldValue":" This article describes staged simulation, a technique for improving the run time performance and scale of discrete event simulators. Typical network simulations are limited in speed and scale due to redundant computations encountered both within a single simulation run and between successive runs. Staged simulation proposes to restructure discrete event simulators to operate in stages that precompute, cache, and reuse partial results to drastically reduce redundant computation within and across simulations. We present a general and flexible framework for staging, and identify the advantages and trade-offs of its application to wireless network simulations, a particularly challenging simulation domain. Experience with applying staged simulation to the ns2 simulator shows that staging can improve execution time by an order of magnitude or more and enable the simulation of wireless networks with tens of thousands of nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24899","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24899","fieldValue":"ACM"}
