Assessing environmental footprints and designing sustainable products are challenging tasks since they require analysis of each component of a product through their life cycle. To achieve sustainable design of products, companies need to evaluate the environmental impact of their system, identify the major contributors to the footprint, and select the design alternative with the lowest environmental footprint. In this article, we formulate sustainable design as a series of clustering and classification problems, and propose a framework called AutoLCA that simplifies the effort of estimating the environmental footprint of a product bill of materials by more than an order of magnitude over current methods, which are mostly labor intensive. We apply AutoLCA to real data from a large computer manufacturer. We conduct a case study on bill of materials of four different products, perform a â\u20ACœhotspotâ\u20AC? assessment analysis to identify major contributors to carbon footprint, and determine design alternatives that can reduce the carbon footprint from 1&percnt; to 36&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7551","fieldValue":"Yu, Philip S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7551","fieldValue":" Multi-label classification refers to the task of predicting potentially multiple labels for a given instance. Conventional multi-label classification approaches focus on single objective setting, where the learning algorithm optimizes over a single performance criterion (e.g., Ranking Loss) or a heuristic function. The basic assumption is that the optimization over one single objective can improve the overall performance of multi-label classification and meet the requirements of various applications. However, in many real applications, an optimal multi-label classifier may need to consider the trade-offs among multiple inconsistent objectives, such as minimizing Hamming Loss while maximizing Micro F1. In this article, we study the problem of multi-objective multi-label classification and propose a novel solution (called Moml) to optimize over multiple objectives simultaneously. Note that optimization objectives may be inconsistent, even conflicting, thus one cannot identify a single solution that is optimal on all objectives. Our Moml algorithm finds a set of non-dominated solutions which are optimal according to different trade-offs among multiple objectives. So users can flexibly construct various predictive models from the solution set, which provides more meaningful classification results in different application scenarios. Empirical studies on real-world tasks demonstrate that the Moml can effectively boost the overall performance of multi-label classification by optimizing over multiple objectives simultaneously."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7551","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7551","fieldValue":"ACM"}
