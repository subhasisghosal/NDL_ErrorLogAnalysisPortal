However, unavailability of a large number of trios is the Achilles' heel of many complex diseases, especially for late-onset diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to this problem by means of the Dempster-Shafer method. The simulation studies show that the Dempster-Shafer method has a promising overall performance, in identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the correct association class, as it has 90 percent accuracy even with 60 trios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4990","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4990","fieldValue":"Algorithm design and analysis, biology and genetics, knowledge and data engineering tools and techniques, probabilistic algorithms"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4991","fieldValue":"St John, Katherine"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4991","fieldValue":" We answer Bryant's combinatorial challenge on minimal walks of phylogenetic treespace under the nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI) metric.
