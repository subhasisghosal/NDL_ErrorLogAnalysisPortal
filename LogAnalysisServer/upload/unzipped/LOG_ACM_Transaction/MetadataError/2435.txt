The formulation is a convex program and can be solved when the indirect utility function is convex in prices. We illustrate that many economies, including: â\u20AC\u201DHomogeneous utilities of degree Î± âˆˆ [0, 1] in Fisher economiesâ\u20AC\u201Dthis includes Linear, Leontief, Cobb-Douglas â\u20AC\u201DResource allocation utilities like multi-commodity flows satisfy this condition and can be efficiently solved. Further, we give a natural tÃ¢tonnement type price-adjusting algorithm in these economies. Our algorithm, which is applicable to a larger class of utility functions than previously known weak gross substitutes, mimics the natural dynamics for the markets as suggested by Walras: it iteratively adjusts a goodâ\u20AC™s price upward when the demand for that good under current prices exceeds its supply; and downward when its supply exceeds its demand. The algorithm computes an approximate equilibrium in a number of iterations that is independent of the number of traders and is almost linear in the number of goods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2708","fieldValue":"ACM"}
