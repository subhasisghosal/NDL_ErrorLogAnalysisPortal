Currently this approach has been considered either in system-level architecture or postplacement stage. Since hierarchical design and reusable intellectual property (IP) are widely used, it is necessary to optimize floorplanning\/placement methodology considering voltage islands generation to solve power and critical path delay problems. In this article, we propose a floorplanning methodology considering voltage islands generation and performance constraints. Our method is flexible and can be extended to hierarchical design. The experimental results on some MCNC benchmarks show that our method is effective in meeting performance constraints and can simultaneously consider the tradeoff between power routing cost and total power dissipation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13162","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13162","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13163","fieldValue":" The current use of $multi-V_t to control leakage power targets combinational gates, even though sequential elements such as flip-flops and latches also contribute appreciable leakage. We can, nevertheless, apply multi-Vt to flip-flops, but few can take advantage of high-Vt, which causes abrupt changes in timing. We combine low- and high-Vt at the transistor level to design mixed-Vt flip-flops with reduced leakage, an unchanged footprint, and a small increase in either setup time or clock-to-Q delay, but not both. An allocation algorithm for two Vts determines the Vt (mixed, high, or low) of each flip-flop and the Vt of each combinational gate (high or low) in a sequential circuit. Experiments with 65-nm technology show an average leakage saving of 42&percnt; compared to conventional multi-Vt approaches; the leakage of flip-flops alone is cut by 78&percnt;. This saving is largely unaffected by die-to-die or within-die process variations, which we show through simulations. Standard deviation of leakage caused by process variation is also reduced due to less use of low-Vt devices. We also extend our approach to three Vt$s, and obtain a further 14&percnt; reduction in leakage."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/13163","fieldValue":"Mixed-<i>V<sub>t<\/sub><\/i>"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13163","fieldValue":"Minimizing leakage power of sequential circuits through $mixed-V_t flip-flops and multi-Vt$ combinational gates"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13163","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13163","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13164","fieldValue":" Soft errors in combinational logic circuits are emerging as a significant reliability problem for VLSI designs. Technology scaling trends indicate that the soft error rates (SER) of logic circuits will be dominant factor for future technology generations. SER mitigation in logic can be accomplished by optimizing either the gates inside a logic block or the flipflops present on the block boundaries. We present novel circuit optimization techniques that target these elements separately as well as in unison to reduce the SER of combinational logic circuits. First, we describe the construction of a new class of flip-flop variants that leverage the effect of temporal masking by selectively increasing the length of the latching window thereby preventing faulty transients from being registered. In contrast to previous flip-flop designs that rely on logic duplication and complicated circuit design styles, the new variants are redesigned from the library flip-flop using efficient transistor sizing. We then propose a flip-flop selection method that uses slack information at each primary output node to determine the flip-flop configuration that produces maximum SER savings. Next, we propose a gate sizing algorithm that trades off SER reduction and area overhead. This approach first computes bounds on the maximum achievable SER reduction by resizing a gate. This bound is then used to prune the circuit graph, arriving at a smaller set of candidate gates on which we perform incremental sensitivity computations to determine the gates that are the largest contributors to circuit SER. Third, we propose a unified, co-optimization approach combining flip-flop selection with the gate sizing algorithm. The joint optimization algorithm produces larger SER reductions while incurring smaller circuit overhead than either technique taken in isolation. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show average SER reductions of 10.7X with gate sizing, 5.7X with flip-flop assignment, and 30.1X for the combined optimization approach, with no delay penalties and area overheads within 5-6&percnt;. The runtimes for the optimization algorithms are on the order of 1-3 minutes."}
