These deformations are realistic and give the user the impression of manipulating real-world objects. We also allow the user to specify the deformations using either sets of points or line segments, the later useful for controlling curves and profiles present in the image. For each of these techniques, we provide simple closed-form solutions that yield fast deformations, which can be performed in real-time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15655","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15655","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15656","fieldValue":" The traditional approach in texture synthesis is to compare color neighborhoods with those of an exemplar. We show that quality is greatly improved if pointwise colors are replaced by appearance vectors that incorporate nonlocal information such as feature and radiance-transfer data. We perform dimensionality reduction on these vectors prior to synthesis, to create a new appearance-space exemplar. Unlike a texton space, our appearance space is low-dimensional and Euclidean. Synthesis in this information-rich space lets us reduce runtime neighborhood vectors from 5x5 grids to just 4 locations. Building on this unifying framework, we introduce novel techniques for coherent anisometric synthesis, surface texture synthesis directly in an ordinary atlas, and texture advection. Remarkably, we achieve all these functionalities in real-time, or 3 to 4 orders of magnitude faster than prior work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15656","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15656","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1174","fieldValue":" A major challenge in wireless terrestrial networks is to provide large-scale reliable multicast and broadcast services. The main problem limiting the scalability of such networks is feedback implosion, a problem arising when a large number of users transmit their feedback messages through the network, occupying a significant portion of system resources. Inspired by social psychology, specifically from the bystander effect phenomenon, an autonomic framework for large-scale reliable multicast services is presented. The self-configuring and self-optimizing procedures of the proposed autonomic scheme are modeled using game theory. Through appropriate modeling and simulations of the proposed scheme carried out to evaluate its performance, it is found that the new approach suppresses feedback messages very effectively, while at the same time, it does not degrade the timely data transfer."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1174","fieldValue":"An autonomic framework for reliable multicast: A game theoretical approach based on social psychology"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1174","fieldValue":"ACM"}
