Most of these either require more bits for feedback than are available in the IP header or incur performance limitations due to inaccurate congestion feedback. There has been recent interest in protocols that obtain high-resolution estimates of congestion by combining the explicit congestion notification (ECN) marks of multiple packets, and using this to guide multiplicative increase, additive increase, multiplicative decrease (MI-AI-MD) window adaptation. This paper studies the potential of such approaches, both analytically and by simulation. The evaluation focuses on a new protocol called Binary Marking Congestion Control (BMCC). It is shown that these schemes can quickly acquire unused capacity, quickly approach a fair rate distribution, and have relatively smooth sending rates, even on high bandwidth-delay product networks. This is achieved while maintaining low average queue length and negligible packet loss. Using extensive simulations, we show that BMCC outperforms XCP, VCP, MLCP, CUBIC, CTCP, SACK, and in some cases RCP, in terms of average flow completion times. Suggestions are also given for the incremental deployment of BMCC."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10355","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10355","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10355","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10356","fieldValue":" An increasingly diverse set of applications, such as Internet games, streaming videos, e-commerce, online banking, and even mission-critical emergency call services, all relies on IP networks. In such an environment, best-effort service is no longer acceptable. This requires a transformation in network management from detecting and replacing individual faulty network elements to managing the end-to-end service quality as a whole. In this paper, we describe the design and development of a Generic Root Cause Analysis platform (G-RCA) for service quality management (SQM) in large IP networks. G-RCA contains a comprehensive service dependencymodel that incorporates topological and cross-layer relationships, protocol interactions, and control plane dependencies. G-RCA abstracts the root cause analysis process into signature identification for symptom and diagnostic events, temporal and spatial event correlation, and reasoning and inference logic. G-RCA provides a flexible rule specification language that allows operators to quickly customize G-RCA and provide different root cause analysis tools as new problems need to be investigated. G-RCA is also integrated with data trending, manual data exploration, and statistical correlation mining capabilities. G-RCA has proven to be a highly effective SQM platform in several different applications, and we present results regarding BGP flaps, PIM flaps in Multicast VPN service, and end-to-end throughput degradation in content delivery network (CDN) service."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10356","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10356","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10356","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10357","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks are constrained by limited battery energy. Thus, finite network lifetime is widely regarded as a fundamental performance bottleneck. Recent breakthrough in the area of wireless power transfer offers the potential of removing this performance bottleneck, i.e., allowing a sensor network to remain operational forever. In this paper, we investigate the operation of a sensor network under this new enabling energy transfer technology. We consider the scenario of a mobile charging vehicle periodically traveling inside the sensor network and charging each sensor node's battery wirelessly. We introduce the concept of renewable energy cycle and offer both necessary and sufficient conditions. We study an optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the ratio of the wireless charging vehicle (WCV)'s vacation time over the cycle time. For this problem, we prove that the optimal traveling path for the WCV is the shortestHamiltonian cycle and provide a number of important properties. Subsequently, we develop a near-optimal solution by a piecewise linear approximation technique and prove its performance guarantee."}
