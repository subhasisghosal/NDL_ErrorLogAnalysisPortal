In this paper, we present a general methodology for building comprehensive behavior profiles of Internet backbone traffic in terms of communication patterns of end-hosts and services. Relying on data mining and entropy-based techniques, the methodology consists of significant cluster extraction, automatic behavior classification and structural modeling for in-depth interpretive analyses. We validate the methodology using data sets from the core of the Internet."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9775","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1885","fieldValue":" Parallelizing HTML parsing is challenging due to the complexities of HTML documents and the inherent dependencies in its parsing algorithm. As a result, despite numerous studies in parallel parsing, HTML parsing remains sequential today. It forms one of the final barriers for fully parallelizing browser operations to minimize the browserâ\u20AC™s response timeâ\u20AC\u201Dan important variable for user experiences, especially on portable devices. This article provides a comprehensive analysis on the special complexities of parallel HTML parsing and presents a systematic exploration in overcoming those difficulties through specially designed speculative parallelizations. This work develops, to the best of our knowledge, the first pipelining and data-level parallel HTML parsers. The data-level parallel parser, named HPar, achieves up to 2.4Ã\u2014 speedup on quadcore devices.

In this paper, we propose a novel packet logging based (i.e., hash-based) traceback scheme that requires an order of magnitude smaller processing and storage cost than the hash-based scheme proposed by Snoeren et al. [1], thereby being able to scalable to much higher link speed (e.g., OC-768). The base-line idea of our approach is to sample and log a small percentage (e.g., 3.3%) of packets. The challenge of this low sampling rate is that much more sophisticated techniques need to be used for traceback. Our solution is to construct the attack tree using the correlation between the attack packets sampled by neighboring routers. The scheme using naive independent random sampling does not perform well due to the low correlation between the packets sampled by neighboring routers. We invent a sampling scheme that improves this correlation and the overall efficiency significantly. Another major contribution of this work is that we introduce a novel information-theoretic framework for our traceback scheme to answer important questions on system parameter tuning and the fundamental tradeoff between the resource used for traceback and the traceback accuracy. Simulation results based on real-world network topologies (e.g., Skitter) match very well with results from the information-theoretic analysis. The simulation results also demonstrate that our traceback scheme can achieve high accuracy, and scale very well to a large number of attackers (e.g., 5000+)."}
