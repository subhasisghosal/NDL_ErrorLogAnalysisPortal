This is followed by an outline of how the macroprocessor was used for the rapid porting of geophysical software from a 64-bit supercomputer environment to a number of different Unix workstations. Finally a number of deficiencies remaining in the macroprocessor are noted and workarounds suggested where possible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18922","fieldValue":" We suggest an interesting and fast method for generating normal, exponential, t, von Mises, and certain other important random variables used in Monte Carlo studies. The right half of a symmetric density is cut into pieces, then, using simple area-preserving transformations, reassembled into a rectangle from which the x-coordinateâ\u20AC\u201Dor a linear function of the x-coordinateâ\u20AC\u201Dof a random point provides the required variate. To illustrate the speed and simplicity of the Monty Python method, we provide a small C program, self-contained, for rapid generation of normal (Gaussian) variables. It is self-contained in the sense that required uniform variates are generated in-line, as pairs of 16-bit integers by means of the remarkable new multiply-with-carry method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18922","fieldValue":"ACM"}
