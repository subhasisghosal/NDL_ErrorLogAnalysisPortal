In basal condition, it is characterized by elevated autophagy activity, which is required for tumor growth and that correlates with treatment failure. We analyzed the expression of autophagy related genes in different pancreatic cancer cell lines. A correlation-based network analysis evidenced the sociality and topological roles of the autophagy-related genes after serum starvation. Structural and functional tests identified a core set of autophagy related genes, suggesting different scenarios of autophagic responses to starvation, which may be responsible for the clinical variations associated with pancreatic cancer pathogenesis."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5149","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5149","fieldValue":"Functional impact of autophagy-related genes on the homeostasis and dynamics of pancreatic cancer cell lines"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5149","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5149","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5150","fieldValue":" Tumor samples are usually heterogeneous, containing admixture of more than one kind of tumor subclones. Studies of genomic aberrations from heterogeneous tumor data are hindered by the mixed signal of tumor subclone cells. Most of the existing algorithms cannot distinguish contributions of different subclones from the measured single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array signals, which may cause erroneous estimation of genomic aberrations. Here, we have introduced a computational method, Cancer Heterogeneity Analysis from SNP-array Experiments (CHASE), to automatically detect subclone proportions and genomic aberrations from heterogeneous tumor samples. Our method is based on HMM, and incorporates EM algorithm to build a statistical model for modeling mixed signal of multiple tumor subclones. We tested the proposed approach on simulated datasets and two real datasets, and the results show that the proposed method can efficiently estimate tumor subclone proportions and recovery the genomic aberrations."}
