Existing approaches employed in primary-ambient extraction (PAE), such as principal component analysis (PCA), are mainly based on a basic stereo signal model. The performance of these PAE approaches has not been well studied for the input signals that do not satisfy all the assumptions of the stereo signal model. In practice, one such case commonly encountered is that the primary components of the stereo signal are partially correlated at zero lag, referred to as the primary-complex case. In this paper, we take PCA as a representative of existing PAE approaches and investigate the performance degradation of PAE with respect to the correlation of the primary components in the primary-complex case. A time-shifting technique is proposed in PAE to alleviate the performance degradation due to the low correlation of the primary components in such stereo signals. This technique involves time-shifting the input signal according to the estimated inter-channel time difference of the primary component prior to the signal decomposition using conventional PAE approaches. To avoid the switching artifacts caused by the varied time-shifting in successive time frames, overlapped output mapping is suggested. Based on the results from our experiments, PAE approaches with the proposed time-shifting technique are found to be superior to the conventional PAE approaches in terms of extraction accuracy and spatial accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3799","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3799","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3800","fieldValue":" Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is a well studied problem. The underlying assumption in most echo cancellation solutions is that the echo path following the reference signal is completely linear. However, in many handheld devices, the echo path following the reference signal is nonlinear. The reason for this nonlinearity in the echo path is the use of smaller inexpensive loudspeakers and the desire for generating high sound pressure levels. This brings about the need for a nonlinear echo canceler to maintain the required echo return loss enhancement (ERLE). Many software-based solutions have been proposed to solve this problem, but the computational complexity of these solutions is prohibitively high for practical implementation. This paper analyzes the sources of nonlinearities in smartphones and proposes a simple, elegant hardware modification to significantly reduce nonlinear echo. Thorough analysis and intensive testing results show that up to 6 dB of improvement in ERLE in a real device is possible using the proposed technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3800","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3800","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3801","fieldValue":"Yang, Yi-Hsuan"}
