Because a lack of social skills is a common problem for a significant number of people, serious games and other training environments have recently become the focus of research. In this work, we present NovA (Nonverbal behavior Analyzer), a system that analyzes and facilitates the interpretation of social signals automatically in a bidirectional interaction with a conversational agent. It records data of interactions, detects relevant social cues, and creates descriptive statistics for the recorded data with respect to the agent's behavior and the context of the situation. This enhances the possibilities for researchers to automatically label corpora of human--agent interactions and to give users feedback on strengths and weaknesses of their social behavior."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7112","fieldValue":"Issue 3(Special Issue on Behavior Understanding for Arts and Entertainment (Part 2 of 2) and Regular Articles), October 2015"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7221","fieldValue":" This editorial introduction complements the shorter introduction to the first part of the two-part special issue on Behavior Understanding for Arts and Entertainment. It offers a more expansive discussion of the use of behavior analysis for interactive systems that involve creativity, either for the producer or the consumer of such a system. We first summarise the two articles that appear in this second part of the special issue. We then discuss general questions and challenges in this domain that were suggested by the entire set of seven articles of the special issue and by the comments of the reviewers of these articles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7221","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7221","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7222","fieldValue":" The notion of â\u20ACœmovement qualitiesâ\u20AC? is central in contemporary dance; it describes the manner in which a movement is executed. Movement qualities convey information revealing movement expressiveness; their use has strong potential for movement-based interaction with applications in arts, entertainment, education, or rehabilitation. The purpose of our research is to design and evaluate interactive reflexive visuals for movement qualities. The theoretical basis for this research is drawn from a collaboration with the members of the international dance company Emio Greco&verbar;PC to study their formalization of movement qualities. We designed a pedagogical interactive installation called Double Skin\/Double Mind (DS\/DM) for the analysis and visualization of movement qualities through physical model-based interactive renderings. In this article, we first evaluate dancersâ\u20AC™ perception of the visuals as metaphors for movement qualities. This evaluation shows that, depending on the physical model parameterization, the visuals are capable of generating dynamic behaviors that the dancers associate with DS\/DM movement qualities. Moreover, we evaluate dance studentsâ\u20AC™ and professionalsâ\u20AC™ experience of the interactive visuals in the context of a dance pedagogical workshop and a professional dance training. The results of these evaluations show that the dancers consider the interactive visuals to be a reflexive system that encourages them to perform, improves their experience, and contributes to a better understanding of movement qualities. Our findings support research on interactive systems for real-time analysis and visualization of movement qualities, which open new perspectives in movement-based interaction design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7222","fieldValue":"ACM"}
