They are syntactically flexible and their meaning can only be partially computed on the basis of the meaning of their parts, thus they require special treatment in natural language processing. For this purpose, the first step is to identify light verb constructions. In this study, we present our conditional random fields-based toolâ\u20AC\u201Dcalled FXTaggerâ\u20AC\u201Dfor identifying light verb constructions. The flexibility of the tool is demonstrated on two, typologically different, languages, namely, English and Hungarian. As earlier studies labeled different linguistic phenomena as light verb constructions, we first present a linguistics-based classification of light verb constructions and then show that FXTagger is able to identify different classes of light verb constructions in both languages. Different types of texts may contain different types of light verb constructions; moreover, the frequency of light verb constructions may differ from domain to domain. Hence we focus on the portability of models trained on different corpora, and we also investigate the effect of simple domain adaptation techniques to reduce the gap between the domains. Our results show that in spite of domain specificities, out-domain data can also contribute to the successful LVC detection in all domains."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23085","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23085","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23086","fieldValue":" The issue of internal variability of multiword expressions (MWEs) is crucial towards their identification and extraction in running text. We present a corpus-supported and computational study on Italian MWEs, aimed at defining an automatic method for modeling internal variation, exploiting frequency and part-of-speech (POS) information. We do so by deriving an XML-encoded lexicon of MWEs based on a manually compiled dictionary, which is then projected onto a a large corpus. Since a search for fixed forms suffers from low recall, while an unconstrained flexible search for lemmas yields a loss in precision, we suggest a procedure aimed at maximizing precision in the identification of MWEs within a flexible search. Our method builds on the idea that internal variability can be modelled via the novel introduction of variation patterns, which work over POS patterns, and can be used as working tools for controlling precision. We also compare the performance of variation patterns to that of association measures, and explore the possibility of using variation patterns in MWE extraction in addition to identification. Finally, we suggest that corpus-derived, pattern-related information can be included in the original MWE lexicon by means of an enriched coding and the creation of an XML-based repository of patterns."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23086","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23086","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23087","fieldValue":"Reviewers"}
