{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4795","fieldValue":" Here, we propose BpMatch: an algorithm that, working on a suitably modified suffix-tree data structure, is able to compute, in a fast and efficient way, the coverage of a source sequence S on a target sequence T, by taking into account direct and reverse segments, eventually overlapped. Using BpMatch, the operator should define a priori, the minimum length l of a segment and the minimum number of occurrences minRep, so that only segments longer than l and having a number of occurrences greater than minRep are considered to be significant. BpMatch outputs the significant segments found and the computed segment-based distance. On the worst case, assuming the alphabet dimension d is a constant, the time required by BpMatch to calculate the coverage is {\\rm O}(l^2n). On the average, by setting l\\ge 2\\log_d(n), the time required to calculate the coverage is only {\\rm O}(n). BpMatch, thanks to the minRep parameter, can also be used to perform a self-covering: to cover a sequence using segments coming from itself, by avoiding the trivial solution of having a single segment coincident with the whole sequence. The result of the self-covering approach is a spectral representation of the repeats contained in the sequence.

Recent evidence of hybridization and lateral gene transfer, however, suggest that there are situations where trees are inadequate. Consequently it is important to determine properties that characterize networks closely related to N and possibly more complicated than trees but lacking the full complexity of N. A connected surjective digraph map (CSD) is a map f from one network N to another network M such that every arc is either collapsed to a single vertex or is taken to an arc, such that f is surjective, and such that the inverse image of a vertex is always connected. CSD maps are shown to behave well under composition. It is proved that if there is a CSD map from N to M, then there is a way to lift an undirected version of M into N, often with added resolution. A CSD map from N to M puts strong constraints on N. In general, it may be useful to study classes of networks such that, for any N, there exists a CSD map from N to some standard member of that class."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4796","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4796","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4796","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4797","fieldValue":" De novo ligand design involves optimization of several ligand properties such as binding affinity, ligand volume, drug likeness, etc. Therefore, optimization of these properties independently and simultaneously seems appropriate. In this paper, the ligand design problem is modeled in a multiobjective using Archived MultiObjective Simulated Annealing (AMOSA) as the underlying search algorithm. The multiple objectives considered are the energy components similarity to a known inhibitor and a novel drug likeliness measure based on Lipinski's rule of five. RecA protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causative agent of tuberculosis, is taken as the target for the drug design. To gauge the goodness of the results, they are compared to the outputs of LigBuilder, NEWLEAD, and Variable genetic algorithm (VGA). The same problem has also been modeled using a well-established genetic algorithm-based multiobjective optimization technique, Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), to find the efficacy of AMOSA through comparative analysis. Results demonstrate that while some small molecules designed by the proposed approach are remarkably similar to the known inhibitors of RecA, some new ones are discovered that may be potential candidates for novel lead molecules against tuberculosis."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4797","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
