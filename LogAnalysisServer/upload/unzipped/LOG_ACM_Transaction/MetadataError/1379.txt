{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15252","fieldValue":" Analytic visibility algorithms, for example methods which compute a subdivided mesh to represent shadows, are notoriously unrobust and hard to use in practice. We present a new method based on a generalized definition of extremal stabbing lines, which are the extremities of shadow boundaries. We treat scenes containing multiple edges or vertices in degenerate configurations, (e.g., collinear or coplanar). We introduce a robust Îµ method to determine whether each generalized extremal stabbing line is blocked, or is touched by these scene elements, and thus added to the line's generators. We develop robust blocker predicates for polygons which are smaller than Îµ. For larger Îµ values, small shadow features merge and eventually disappear. We can thus robustly connect generalized extremal stabbing lines in degenerate scenes to form shadow boundaries. We show that our approach is consistent, and that shadow boundary connectivity is preserved when features merge. We have implemented our algorithm, and show that we can robustly compute analytic shadow boundaries to the precision of our chosen Îµ threshold for non-trivial models, containing numerous degeneracies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2445","fieldValue":" The construction of perfect hash functions is a well-studied topic. In this article, this concept is generalized with the following definition. We say that a family of functions from [n] to [k] is a Î\u201D-balanced (n,k)-family of perfect hash functions if for every S âŠ\u2020 [n], &vert; S &vert;&equals;k, the number of functions that are 1-1 on S is between T\/Î\u201D and Î\u201D T for some constant T>0. The standard definition of a family of perfect hash functions requires that there will be at least one function that is 1-1 on S, for each S of size k. In the new notion of balanced families, we require the number of 1-1 functions to be almost the same (taking Î\u201D to be close to 1) for every such S. Our main result is that for any constant Î\u201D > 1, a Î\u201D-balanced (n,k)-family of perfect hash functions of size $2^O(k log log k) log n can be constructed in time 2O(k log log k)$ n log n. Using the technique of color-coding we can apply our explicit constructions to devise approximation algorithms for various counting problems in graphs. In particular, we exhibit a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for approximating both the number of simple paths of length k and the number of simple cycles of size k for any k â\u2030¤ O(log n\/log log log n) in a graph with n vertices. The approximation is up to any fixed desirable relative error."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2445","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2445","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15253","fieldValue":" This paper introduces an efficient two-pass rendering technique for translucent materials. We decouple the computation of irradianceat the surface from the evaluation of scattering inside the material.This is done by splitting the evaluation into two passes, where the first pass consists of computing the irradiance at selected points on the surface. The second pass uses a rapid hierarchical integration technique to evaluate a diffusion approximation based on the irradiance samples. This approach is substantially faster than previous methods for rendering translucent materials, and it has the advantage that it integrates seamlessly with both scanline rendering and global illumination methods. We show several images and animations from our implementation that demonstrate that the approach is both fast and robust, making it suitable for rendering translucent materials in production."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15253","fieldValue":"BSSRDF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15253","fieldValue":"ACM"}
