For a long time nothing better than the trivial $O*(n!)^1 exhaustive search was known. In 2000, Feige and Kilian [Feige 2000] came up with a O*(10n)-time and polynomial space algorithm. In this article we present a new algorithm that solves Bandwidth in O*(5n) time and O*(2n) space. Then, we take a closer look and introduce a major modification that makes it run in O(4.83n) time with a cost of a O*$(4n) space complexity. This modification allowed us to perform the Measure & Conquer analysis for the time complexity which was not used for graph layout problems before."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16084","fieldValue":" We present a subdivision framework that adds extraordinary vertices to NURBS of arbitrarily high degree. The surfaces can represent any odd degree NURBS patch exactly. Our rules handle non-uniform knot vectors, and are not restricted to midpoint knot insertion. In the absence of multiple knots at extraordinary points, the limit surfaces have bounded curvature."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16084","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16084","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16085","fieldValue":" This paper presents a highly efficient direct trimming technique for NURBS surfaces, which is applicable to tessellation-based rendering as well as ray tracing systems. The central idea is to split the trim curves into monotonic segments with respect to the two parameter dimensions of the surface patches. We use an optimized bisection method to classify a point with respect to each monotonic trim curve segment without performing an actual intersection test. Our hierarchical acceleration structure allows the use of a large number of such curve segments and performs the bisection method only for points contained in the bounding boxes of the curve segments. We have integrated our novel point classification scheme into a GPU-based NURBS ray casting system and implemented the entire trimmed NURBS rendering algorithm in a single OpenGL GLSL shader. The shader can handle surfaces and trim curves of arbitrary degrees, which allows the use of original CAD data without incorporating any approximations. Performance data confirms that our trimming approach can deal with hundreds of thousands of trim curves at interactive rates. Our point classification scheme can be applied to other application domains dealing with complex curved regions including flood fills, font rendering and vector graphics mapped on arbitrary surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16085","fieldValue":"ACM"}
