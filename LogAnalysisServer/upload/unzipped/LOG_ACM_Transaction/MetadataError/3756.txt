It is often the case that XML documents contain information of different sensitivity degrees that must be selectively shared by (possibly large) user communities. There is thus the need for models and mechanisms enabling the specification and enforcement of access control policies for XML documents. Mechanisms are also required enabling a secure and selective dissemination of documents to users, according to the authorizations that these users have. In this article, we make several contributions to the problem of secure and selective dissemination of XML documents. First, we define a formal model of access control policies for XML documents. Policies that can be defined in our model take into account both user profiles, and document contents and structures. We also propose an approach, based on an extension of the Cryptolope#8482; approach [Gladney and Lotspiech 1997], which essentially allows one to send the same document to all users, and yet to enforce the stated access control policies. Our approach consists of encrypting different portions of the same document according to different encryption keys, and selectively distributing these keys to the various users according to the access control policies. We show that the number of encryption keys that have to be generated under our approach is minimal and we present an architecture to support document distribution."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22138","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22138","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22138","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22139","fieldValue":"Parisi-Presicce, Francesco"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22139","fieldValue":" Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is supported directly or in a closely related form, by a number of products. This article presents a formalization of RBAC using graph transformations that is a graphical specification technique based on a generalization of classical string grammars to nonlinear structures. The proposed formalization provides an intuitive description for the manipulation of graph structures as they occur in information systems access control and a precise specification of static and dynamic consistency conditions on graphs and graph transformations. The formalism captures the RBAC models published in the literature, and also allows a uniform treatment of user roles and administrative roles, and a detailed analysis of the decentralization of administrative roles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22139","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22139","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22140","fieldValue":" Unlike other access control systems based on biometric features, keystroke analysis has not led to techniques providing an acceptable level of accuracy. The reason is probably the intrinsic variability of typing dynamics, versus other---very stable---biometric characteristics, such as face or fingerprint patterns. In this paper we present an original measure for keystroke dynamics that limits the instability of this biometric feature. We have tested our approach on 154 individuals, achieving a False Alarm Rate of about 4&percnt; and an Impostor Pass Rate of less than 0.01&percnt;. This performance is reached using the same sampling text for all the individuals, allowing typing errors, without any specific tailoring of the authentication system with respect to the available set of typing samples and users, and collecting the samples over a 28.8-Kbaud remote modem connection."}
