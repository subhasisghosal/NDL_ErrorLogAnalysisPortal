Our work is based on the generalized Nyström method for low rank matrices. We introduce the light transport kernel and incorporate it into the Nyström method to exploit the nonlinear coherence of the light transport matrix. We also develop an adaptive scheme for efficiently capturing the sparsely sampled images from the scene. Our experiments indicate that the kernel Nyström method can achieve good reconstruction of the light transport matrix with a few hundred images and produce high quality relighting results. The kernel Nyström method is effective for modeling scenes with complex lighting effects and occlusions which have been challenging for existing techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16068","fieldValue":" We present a new model of the homogeneous BSSRDF based on large-scale simulations. Our model captures the appearance of materials that are not accurately represented using existing single scattering models or multiple isotropic scattering models (e.g. the diffusion approximation). We use an analytic function to model the 2D hemispherical distribution of exitant light at a point on the surface, and a table of parameter values of this function computed at uniformly sampled locations over the remaining dimensions of the BSSRDF domain. This analytic function is expressed in elliptic coordinates and has six parameters which vary smoothly with surface position, incident angle, and the underlying optical properties of the material (albedo, mean free path length, phase function and the relative index of refraction). Our model agrees well with measured data, and is compact, requiring only 250MB to represent the full spatial- and angular-distribution of light across a wide spectrum of materials. In practice, rendering a single material requires only about 100KB to represent the BSSRDF."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16068","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16068","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16069","fieldValue":" In this paper we present SubEdit, a representation for editing the BSSRDF of heterogeneous subsurface scattering acquired from real-world samples. Directly editing measured raw data is difficult due to the non-local impact of heterogeneous subsurface scattering on the appearance. Our SubEdit representation decouples these non-local effects into the product of two local scattering profiles defined at respectively the incident and outgoing surface locations. This allows users to directly manipulate the appearance of single surface locations and to robustly make selections. To further facilitate editing, we reparameterize the scattering profiles into the local appearance concepts of albedo, scattering range, and profile shape. Our method preserves the visual quality of the measured material after editing by maintaining the consistency of subsurface transport for all edits. SubEdit fits measured data well while remaining efficient enough to support interactive rendering and manipulation. We illustrate the suitability of SubEdit as a representation for editing by applying various complex modifications on a wide variety of measured heterogeneous subsurface scattering materials."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16069","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16069","fieldValue":"ACM"}
