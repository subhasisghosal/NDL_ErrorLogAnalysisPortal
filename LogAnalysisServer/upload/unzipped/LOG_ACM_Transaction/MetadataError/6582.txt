We introduce governance as the administration of such a system by the stakeholders themselves. In this regard, governance is a peer-to-peer notion and contrasts with traditional management, which is a top-down hierarchical notion. Traditionally, there is no computational support for governance and it is achieved through out-of-band interactions among system administrators. Not surprisingly, traditional approaches simply do not scale up to large sociotechnical systems. We develop an approach for governance based on a computational representation of norms in organizations. Our approach is motivated by the Ocean Observatory Initiative, a thirty-year &dollar;400 million project, which supports a variety of resources dealing with monitoring and studying the world's oceans. These resources include autonomous underwater vehicles, ocean gliders, buoys, and other instrumentation as well as more traditional computational resources. Our approach has the benefit of directly reflecting stakeholder needs and assuring stakeholders of the correctness of the resulting governance decisions while yielding adaptive resource allocation in the face of changes in both stakeholder needs and physical circumstances."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7539","fieldValue":" Learning user interests from online social networks helps to better understand user behaviors and provides useful guidance to design user-centric applications. Apart from analyzing users' online content, it is also important to consider users' social connections in the social Web. Graph regularization methods have been widely used in various text mining tasks, which can leverage the graph structure information extracted from data. Previously, graph regularization methods operate under the cluster assumption that nearby nodes are more similar and nodes on the same structure (typically referred to as a cluster or a manifold) are likely to be similar. We argue that learning user interests from complex, sparse, and dynamic social networks should be based on the link structure assumption under which node similarities are evaluated based on the local link structures instead of explicit links between two nodes. We propose a regularization framework based on the relation bipartite graph, which can be constructed from any type of relations. Using Twitter as our case study, we evaluate our proposed framework from social networks built from retweet relations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our proposed method outperforms a few competitive baselines in learning user interests over a set of predefined topics. It also gives superior results compared to the baselines on retweet prediction and topical authority identification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7539","fieldValue":"ACM"}
