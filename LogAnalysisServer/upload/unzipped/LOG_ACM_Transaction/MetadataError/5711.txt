In general, the secondary structure of a searched noncoding RNA is defined with a structure model constructed from the structural alignment of a set of sequences from its family. Computing the optimal alignment between a sequence and a structure model is the core part of an algorithm that can search genomes for noncoding RNAs. In practice, a single structure model may not be sufficient to capture all crucial features important for a noncoding RNA family. In this paper, we develop a novel machine learning approach that can efficiently search genomes for noncoding RNAs with high accuracy. During the search procedure, a sequence segment in the searched genome sequence is processed and a feature vector is extracted to represent it. Based on the feature vector, a classifier is used to determine whether the sequence segment is the searched ncRNA or not. Our testing results show that this approach is able to efficiently capture crucial features of a noncoding RNA family. Compared with existing search tools, it significantly improves the accuracy of genome annotation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5138","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5138","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5138","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5139","fieldValue":" The upstream region of coding genes is important for several reasons, for instance locating transcription factor, binding sites, and start site initiation in genomic DNA. Motivated by a recently conducted study, where multivariate approach was successfully applied to coding sequence modeling, we have introduced a partial least squares (PLS) based procedure for the classification of true upstream prokaryotic sequence from background upstream sequence. The upstream sequences of conserved coding genes over genomes were considered in analysis, where conserved coding genes were found by using pan-genomics concept for each considered prokaryotic species. PLS uses position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) to study the characteristics of upstream region. Results obtained by PLS based method were compared with Gini importance of random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), which is much used method for sequence classification. The upstream sequence classification performance was evaluated by using cross validation, and suggested approach identifies prokaryotic upstream region significantly better to RF (p-value < 0:01) and SVM (p-value < 0:01). Further, the proposed method also produced results that concurred with known biological characteristics of the upstream region."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5139","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5139","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5139","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5140","fieldValue":"Li, YanBo"}
