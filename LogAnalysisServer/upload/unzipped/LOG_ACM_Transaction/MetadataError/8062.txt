To that end, we study a parametric class of maximum-weight-type scheduling policies, called Regular Service Guarantee (RSG) Algorithm, where each link weight consists of its own queue length and a counter that tracks the time since the last service, namely Time-Since-Last-Service (TSLS). The RSG Algorithm not only is throughput-optimal, but also achieves a tradeoff between the service regularity performance and the mean delay, i.e., the service regularity performance of the RSG Algorithm improves at the cost of increasing mean delay. This motivates us to investigate whether satisfactory service regularity and low mean-delay can be simultaneously achieved by the RSG Algorithm by carefully selecting its design parameter. To that end, we perform a novel Lyapunov-drift-based analysis of the steady-state behavior of the stochastic network. Our analysis reveals that the RSG Algorithm can minimize the total mean queue length to establish mean delay optimality under heavily loaded conditions as long as the design parameter weighting for the TSLS scales no faster than the order of [EQUATION], where Îµ measures the closeness of the network load to the boundary of the capacity region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides regular service to all links while also achieving heavy-traffic optimality in mean queue lengths."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10935","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10935","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10935","fieldValue":"Wireless scheduling design for optimizing both service regularity and mean delay in heavy-traffic regimes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10935","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10935","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10936","fieldValue":" Auctions are among the best-known market-based tools to solve the problem of dynamic spectrum redistribution. In recent years, a good number of strategy-proof auction mechanisms have been proposed to improve spectrum utilization and to prevent market manipulation. However, the issue of privacy preservation in spectrum auctions remains open. On the one hand, truthful bidding reveals bidders' private valuations of the spectrum. On the other hand, coverage\/interference areas of the bidders may be revealed to determine conflicts. In this paper, we present PISA, which is a PrIvacy preserving and Strategy-proof Auction mechanism for spectrum allocation. PISA provides protection for both bid privacy and coverage\/interference area privacy leveraging a privacy-preserving integer comparison protocol, which is well applicable in other contexts. We not only theoretically prove the privacy-preserving properties of PISA, but also extensively evaluate its performance. Evaluation results show that PISA achieves good spectrum allocation efficiency with light computation and communication overheads."}
