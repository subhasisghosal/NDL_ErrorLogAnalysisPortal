{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6785","fieldValue":" This article presents a new approach to the design of task scheduling algorithms, where system-theoretical methodologies are used throughout. The proposal implies a significant perspective shift with respect to mainstream design practices, but yields large payoffs in terms of simplicity, flexibility, solution uniformity for different problems, and possibility to formally assess the results also in the presence of unpredictable run-time situations. A complete implementation example is illustrated, together with various comparative tests, and a methodological treatise of the matter."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6786","fieldValue":" We present a new mechanism called Elon for enabling efficient and long-term reprogramming in wireless sensor networks. Elon reduces the transferred code size significantly by introducing the concept of replaceable component. It avoids the cost of hardware reboot with a novel software reboot mechanism. Moreover, it significantly prolongs the reprogrammable lifetime (i.e., the time period during which the sensor nodes can be reprogrammed) by avoiding flash writes for TelosB nodes. Experimental results show that Elon transfers up to 120--389 times less information than Deluge, and 18--42 times less information than Stream. The software reboot mechanism that Elon applies reduces the rebooting cost by 50.4&percnt;--53.87&percnt; in terms of beacon packets, and 56.83&percnt; in terms of unsynchronized nodes. In addition, Elon prolongs the reprogrammable lifetime by a factor of 3.3."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6787","fieldValue":" It is meaningful to design a strategy to roughly localize mobile phones without a GPS by exploiting existing conditions and devices especially in environments without GPS availability (e.g., tunnels, subway stations, etc.). The availability of Bluetooth devices for most phones and the existence of a number of GPS equipped phones in a crowd of phone users enable us to design a Bluetooth aided mobile phone localization strategy. With the position of GPS equipped phones as beacons, and with the Bluetooth connection between neighbor phones as proximity constraints, we formulate the problem into an inequality problem defined on the Bluetooth network. A recurrent neural network is developed to solve the problem distributively in real time. The convergence of the neural network and the solution feasibility to the defined problem are both theoretically proven. The hardware implementation architecture of the proposed neural network is also given in this article. As applications, rough localizations of drivers in a tunnel and localization of customers in a supermarket are explored and simulated. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6788","fieldValue":"Tseng, Wei-Che"}
