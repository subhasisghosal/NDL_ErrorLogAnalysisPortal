{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22108","fieldValue":" In this article we propose a new framework for multicast security based on distributed computation of security transforms by intermediate nodes. The involvement of intermediate nodes in the security process causes a new type of dependency between group membership and the topology of the multicast network. Thanks to this dependency, the containment of security exposures in large multicast groups is ensured. The framework also ensures both the scalability for large dynamic groups and the security of individual members. Two different key distribution protocols complying with the framework are introduced: an extension of the EIGamal encryption scheme, and one based on a multiexponent version of RSA."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22108","fieldValue":"RSA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22109","fieldValue":" We describe and analyze a new digital signature scheme. The new scheme is quite efficient, does not require the signer to maintain any state, and can be proven secure against adaptive chosen message attack under a reasonable intractability assumption, the so-called strong RSA assumption. Moreover, a hash function can be incorporated into the scheme in such a way that it is also secure in the random oracle model under the standard RSA assumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22109","fieldValue":"RSA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22109","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22109","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3107","fieldValue":" Identifying semantic relations is a crucial step in discourse analysis and is useful for many applications in both language and speech technology. Automatic detection of Causal relations therefore has gained popularity in the literature within different frameworks. The aim of this article is the automatic detection and extraction of Causal relations that are explicitly expressed in Arabic texts. To fulfill this goal, a Pattern Recognizer model was developed to signal the presence of cause--effect information within sentences from nonspecific domain texts. This model incorporates approximately 700 linguistic patterns so that parts of the sentence representing the cause and those representing the effect can be distinguished. The patterns were constructed based on different sets of syntactic features by analyzing a large untagged Arabic corpus. In addition, the model was boosted with three independent algorithms to deal with certain types of grammatical particles that indicate causation. With this approach, the proposed model achieved an overall recall of 81&percnt; and a precision of 78&percnt;. Evaluation results revealed that the justification particles play a key role in detecting Causal relations. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have been dedicated to dealing with this type of relation in the Arabic language."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3107","fieldValue":"ACM"}
