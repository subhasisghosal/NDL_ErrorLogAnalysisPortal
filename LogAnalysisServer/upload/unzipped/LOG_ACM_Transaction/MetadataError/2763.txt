Its particularity is to extend to arbitrary-precision, ideas from the IEEE 754 standard, by providing correct rounding and exceptions. We demonstrate how these strong semantics are achieved---with no significant slowdown with respect to other arbitrary-precision tools---and discuss a few applications where such a library can be useful."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19168","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19168","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19169","fieldValue":" IFISS is a graphical Matlab package for the interactive numerical study of incompressible flow problems. It includes algorithms for discretization by mixed finite element methods and a posteriori error estimation of the computed solutions. The package can also be used as a computational laboratory for experimenting with state-of-the-art preconditioned iterative solvers for the discrete linear equation systems that arise in incompressible flow modelling. A unique feature of the package is its comprehensive nature; for each problem addressed, it enables the study of both discretization and iterative solution algorithms as well as the interaction between the two and the resulting effect on overall efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19169","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19169","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2855","fieldValue":" This article reports on a temporal tagger for Korean based on a Korean extension of the TIDES TIMEX2 guidelines. The extension, which primarily addresses the idiosyncrasies of Korean morphology, shows high inter-annotator reliability (0.893 F-measure for tag extent) when applied to a corpus of Korean newspaper articles. A machine-learning approach based on rote learning from a human-edited, automatically-derived dictionary of temporal expressions is compared with a second approach that adds manual patterns, and a third onethat tries to learn the patterns. Results for the first two are promising (0.87 F-measure for tag extent). Overall, the article shows that rote learning approaches can be very useful when language-specific features such as morphology are taken into account."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2855","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2855","fieldValue":"ACM"}
