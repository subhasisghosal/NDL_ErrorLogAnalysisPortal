Acoustic communication is best suited for underwater communication, with much lower attenuation than RF, but acoustic propagation is five orders-of-magnitude slower than RF, so propagation times stretch to hundreds of milliseconds. Low-power wakeup tones are present in new underwater acoustic modems, and when added to applications and MAC protocols they reduce energy consumption wasted on idle listening. Unfortunately, underwater acoustic tones suffer from self-multipathâ\u20AC\u201Dechoes unique to the latency that can completely defeat their protocol advantages. We introduce Self-Reflection Tone Learning (SRTL), a novel approach where nodes use Bayesian techniques to address interference by learning to discriminate self-reflections from noise and independent communication. We present detailed experiments using an acoustic modem in controlled and uncontrolled, in-air and underwater environments. These experiments demonstrate that SRTL's knowledge corresponds to physical-world predictions, that it can cope with underwater noise and reasonable levels of artificial noise, and that it can track a changing multipath environment. Simulations confirm that these real-world experiments generalize over a wide range of conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21423","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2422966.2422984\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21423","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21423","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21424","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks are typically composed of low-cost sensors that are deeply integrated in physical environments. As a result, the sensing performance of a wireless sensor network is inevitably undermined by biases in imperfect sensor hardware and the noises in data measurements. Although a variety of calibration methods have been proposed to address these issues, they often adopt the device-level approach that becomes intractable for moderate-to large-scale networks. In this article, we propose a two-tier system-level calibration approach for a class of sensor networks that employ data fusion to improve the sensing performance. In the first tier of our calibration approach, each sensor learns its local sensing model from noisy measurements using an online algorithm and only transmits a few model parameters. In the second tier, sensors' local sensing models are then calibrated to a common system sensing model. Our approach fairly distributes computation overhead among sensors and significantly reduces the communication overhead of calibration compared with the device-level approach. Based on this approach, we develop an optimal model calibration scheme that maximizes the target detection probability of a sensor network under bounded false alarm rate. Our approach is evaluated by both experiments on a testbed of TelosB motes and extensive simulations based on synthetic datasets as well as data traces collected in a real vehicle detection experiment. The results demonstrate that our system-level calibration approach can significantly boost the detection performance of sensor networks in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21424","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2480730.2480731\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21424","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21424","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21425","fieldValue":" In recent years, the demand for high-precision tracking systems has significantly increased in the field of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). A new tracking system based on exploitation of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements in WSN is proposed. The proposed system is designed in particular for WSNs that are deployed in close proximity and can transmit data at a high transmission rate. The close proximity and an optimized transmit power level enable accurate conversion of RSSI measurements to range estimates. Having an adequate transmission rate enables spatial-temporal correlation between consecutive RSSI measurements. In addition, advanced statistical and signal processing methods are used to mitigate channel distortion and to compensate for packet loss. The system is evaluated in indoor conditions and achieves tracking resolution of a few centimeters which is compatible with theoretical bounds."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21425","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2480730.2480732\"}"}
