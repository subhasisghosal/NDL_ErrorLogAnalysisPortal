A formal description of the architecture of the resulting component-based software system may help to detect such architectural mismatches and to single out the components that cause the mismatches. In this article, we concentrate on deadlock-related architectural mismatches arising from three different causes that we identify: incompatibility between two components due to a single interaction, incompatibility between two components due to the combination of several interactions, and lack of interoperability among a set of components forming a cyclic topology. We develop a process algebra-based architectural description language called PADL, which deals with all three causes through an architectural compatibility check and an architectural interoperability check relying on standard observational equivalences. The adequacy of the architectural compatibility check is assessed on a compressing proxy system, while the adequacy of the architectural interoperability check is assessed on a cruise control system. We then address the issue of scaling the architectural compatibility and interoperability checks to architectural styles through an extension of PADL. The formalization of an architectural style is complicated by the presence of two degrees of freedom within the set of instances of the style: variability of the internal behavior of the components and variability of the topology formed by the components. As a first step towards the solution of the problem, we propose an intermediate abstraction called architectural type, whose instances differ only for the internal behavior of their components. We define an efficient architectural conformity check based on a standard observational equivalence to verify whether an architecture is an instance of an architectural type. We show that all the architectures conforming to the same architectural type possess the same compatibility and interoperability properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22684","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22684","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3213","fieldValue":"McGookin, David K."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3213","fieldValue":" Two investigations into the identification of concurrently presented, structured sounds, called earcons were carried out. One of the experiments investigated how varying the number of concurrently presented earcons affected their identification. It was found that varying the number had a significant effect on the proportion of earcons identified. Reducing the number of concurrently presented earcons lead to a general increase in the proportion of presented earcons successfully identified. The second experiment investigated how modifying the earcons and their presentation, using techniques influenced by auditory scene analysis, affected earcon identification. It was found that both modifying the earcons such that each was presented with a unique timbre, and altering their presentation such that there was a 300 ms onset-to-onset time delay between each earcon were found to significantly increase identification. Guidelines were drawn from this work to assist future interface designers when incorporating concurrently presented earcons."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3213","fieldValue":"Understanding concurrent earcons: Applying auditory scene analysis principles to concurrent earcon recognition"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3213","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3213","fieldValue":"ACM"}
