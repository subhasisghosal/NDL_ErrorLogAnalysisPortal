Out-of-sequence packets can result from many events including loss, looping, reordering, or duplication in the network. It is important to quantify and understand the causes of such out-of-sequence packets since it is an indicator of the performance of a TCP connection, and the quality of its end-end path. Our study is based on passively observed packets from a point inside a large backbone network--as opposed to actively sending and measuring end-end probe traffic at the sender or receiver. A new methodology is thus required to infer the causes of a connection's out-of-sequence packets using only measurements taken in the \"middle\" of the connection's end-end path. We describe techniques that classify observed out-of-sequence behavior based only on the previously- and subsequently-observed packets within a connection and knowledge of how TCP behaves. We analyze numerous several-hour packet-level traces from a set of OC-12 and OC-48 links for tens of millions connections generated in nearly 7600 unique ASes. We show that using our techniques, it is possible to classify almost all out-of-sequence packets in our traces and that we can quantify the uncertainty in our classification. Our measurements show a relatively consistent rate of out-of-sequence packets of approximately 4%. We observe that a majority of out-of-sequence packets are retransmissions, with a smaller percentage resulting from in-network reordering."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9576","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9576","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9576","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9577","fieldValue":"de Veciana, Gustavo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9577","fieldValue":" Internet traffic primarily consists of packets from elastic flows, i.e., Web transfers, file transfers, and e-mail, whose transmissions are mediated via the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). In this paper, we develop a methodology to process TCP flow measurements in order to analyze throughput correlations among TCP flow classes that can be used to infer congestion sharing in the Internet. The primary contributions of this paper are: 1) development of a technique for processing flow records suitable for inferring congested resource sharing; 2) evaluation of the use of factor analysis on processed flow records to explore which TCP flow classes might share congested resources; and 3) validation of our inference methodology using bootstrap methods and nonintrusive, flow level measurements collected at a single network site. Our proposal for using flow level measurements to infer congestion sharing differs significantly from previous research that has employed packet level measurements for making inferences. Possible applications of our method include network monitoring and root cause analysis of poor performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9577","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9577","fieldValue":"ACM"}
