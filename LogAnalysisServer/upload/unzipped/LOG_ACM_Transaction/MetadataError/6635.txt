{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1696","fieldValue":" One important trend in today's microprocessor architectures is the increase in size of the processor caches. These caches also tend to be set associative. As technology scales, process variations are expected to increase the fault rates of the SRAM cells that compose such caches. As an important component of the processor, the parametric yield of SRAM cells is crucial to the overall performance and yield of the microchip. In this article, we propose a microarchitectural solution, called the buddy cache that permits large, set-associative caches to tolerate faults in SRAM cells due to process variations. In essence, instead of disabling a faulty cache block in a set (as is the current practice), it is paired with another faulty cache block in the same setâ\u20AC\u201Dthe buddy. Although both cache blocks are faulty, if the faults of the two blocks do not overlap, then instead of losing two blocks, buddying will yield a functional block from the nonfaulty portions of the two blocks. We found that with buddying, caches can better mitigate the negative impacts of process variations on performance and yield, gracefully downgrading performance as opposed to catastrophic failure. We will describe the details of the buddy cache and give insights as to why it is both more performance and yield resilient to faults."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7665","fieldValue":" In this article, we tackle the problem of predicting the â\u20ACœnextâ\u20AC? geographical position of a tourist, given her history (i.e., the prediction is done accordingly to the touristâ\u20AC™s current trail) by means of supervised learning techniques, namely Gradient Boosted Regression Trees and Ranking SVM. The learning is done on the basis of an object space represented by a 68-dimension feature vector specifically designed for tourism-related data. Furthermore, we propose a thorough comparison of several methods that are considered state-of-the-art in recommender and trail prediction systems for tourism, as well as a popularity baseline. Experiments show that the methods we propose consistently outperform the baselines and provide strong evidence of the performance and robustness of our solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7665","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7665","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7666","fieldValue":" People often take photographs at tourist sites and these pictures usually have two main elements: a person in the foreground and scenery in the background. This type of â\u20ACœsouvenir photoâ\u20AC? is one of the most common photos clicked by tourists. Although algorithms that aid a user-photographer in taking a well-composed picture of a scene exist [Ni et al. 2013], few studies have addressed the issue of properly positioning human subjects in photographs. In photography, the common guidelines of composing portrait images exist. However, these rules usually do not consider the background scene. Therefore, in this article, we investigate human-scenery positional relationships and construct a photographic assistance system to optimize the position of human subjects in a given background scene, thereby assisting the user in capturing high-quality souvenir photos. We collect thousands of well-composed portrait photographs to learn human-scenery aesthetic composition rules. In addition, we define a set of negative rules to exclude undesirable compositions. Recommendation results are achieved by combining the first learned positive rule with our proposed negative rules. We implement the proposed system on an Android platform in a smartphone. The system demonstrates its efficacy by producing well-composed souvenir photos."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7666","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7666","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7667","fieldValue":" This article presents novel methods for representing and analyzing a special class of multiagent bargaining settings that feature multiple players, large action spaces, and a relationship among playersâ\u20AC™ goals, tasks, and resources. We show how to reduce these interactions to a set of bilateral normal-form games in which the strategy space is significantly smaller than the original settings while still preserving much of their structural relationship. The method is demonstrated using the Colored Trails (CT) framework, which encompasses a broad family of games and has been used in many past studies. We define a set of heuristics (metastrategies) in multiplayer CT games that make varying assumptions about playersâ\u20AC™ strategies, such as boundedly rational play and social preferences. We show how these CT settings can be decomposed into canonical bilateral games such as the Prisonersâ\u20AC™ Dilemma, Stag Hunt, and Ultimatum games in a way that significantly facilitates their analysis. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in separate CT settings involving one-shot and repeated bargaining scenarios, which are subsequently analyzed using evolutionary game-theoretic techniques. We provide a set of necessary conditions for CT games for allowing this decomposition. Our results have significance for multiagent systems researchers in mapping large multiplayer CT task settings to smaller, well-known bilateral normal-form games while preserving some of the structure of the original setting."}
