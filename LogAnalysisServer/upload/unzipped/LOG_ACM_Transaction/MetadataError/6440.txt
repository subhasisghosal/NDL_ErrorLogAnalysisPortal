Physiological signals such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological signals have been less considered for emotion recognition in comparison to other modalities such as facial expression and speech, although they have a potential interest as alternative or supplementary channels. This article presents our work on: (1) constructing a dataset containing EEG and peripheral physiological signals acquired during presentation of music video clips, which is made publicly available, and (2) conducting binary classification of induced positive\/negative valence, high\/low arousal, and like\/dislike by using the aforementioned signals. The procedure for the dataset acquisition, including stimuli selection, signal acquisition, self-assessment, and signal processing is described in detail. Especially, we propose a novel asymmetry index based on relative wavelet entropy for measuring the asymmetry in the energy distribution of EEG signals, which is used for EEG feature extraction. Then, the classification systems based on EEG and peripheral physiological signals are presented. Single-trial and single-run classification results indicate that, on average, the performance of the EEG-based classification outperforms that of the peripheral physiological signals. However, the peripheral physiological signals can be considered as a good alternative to EEG signals in the case of assessing a user's preference for a given music video clip (like\/dislike) since they have a comparable performance to EEG signals while being more easily measured."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7139","fieldValue":"EEG"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7139","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7139","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1651","fieldValue":" Traditionally, software pipelining is applied either to the innermost loop of a given loop nest or from the innermost loop to outer loops. This paper proposes a three-step approach, called single-dimension software pipelining (SSP), to software pipeline a loop nest at an arbitrary loop level that has a rectangular iteration space and contains no sibling inner loops in it. The first step identifies the most profitable loop level for software pipelining in terms of initiation rate, data reuse potential, or any other optimization criteria. The second step simplifies the multidimensional data-dependence graph (DDG) of the selected loop level into a one-dimensional DDG and constructs a one-dimensional (1D) schedule. Based on the one-dimensional schedule, the third step derives a simple mapping function that specifies the schedule time for the operation instances in the multidimensional loop. The classical modulo scheduling is subsumed by SSP as a special case. SSP is also closely related to hyperplane scheduling, and, in fact, extends it to be resource constrained. We prove that SSP schedules are correct and at least as efficient as those schedules generated by traditional modulo scheduling methods. We extend SSP to schedule imperfect loop nests, which are most common at the instruction level. Multiple initiation intervals are naturally allowed to improve execution efficiency. Feasibility and correctness of our approach are verified by a prototype implementation in the ORC compiler for the IA-64 architecture, tested with loop nests from Livermore and SPEC2000 floating-point benchmarks. Preliminary experimental results reveal that, compared to modulo scheduling, software pipelining at an appropriate loop level results in significant performance improvement. Software pipelining is beneficial even with prior loop transformations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1651","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1651","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7140","fieldValue":" Bias in the news media is an inherent flaw of the news production process. The bias often causes a sharp increase in political polarization and in the cost of conflict on social issues such as the Iraq war. This article presents NewsCube, a novel Internet news service which aims to mitigate the effect of media bias. NewsCube automatically creates and promptly provides readers with multiple classified views on a news event. As such, it helps readers understand the event from a plurality of views and to formulate their own, more balanced, viewpoints. The media bias problem has been studied extensively in mass communications and social science. This article reviews related mass communication and journalism studies and provides a structured view of the media bias problem and its solution. We propose media bias mitigation as a practical solution and demonstrate it through NewsCube. We evaluate and discuss the effectiveness of NewsCube through various performance studies."}
