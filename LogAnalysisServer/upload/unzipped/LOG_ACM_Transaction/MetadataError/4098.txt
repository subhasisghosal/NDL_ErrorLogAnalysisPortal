Parallel experiments here investigated the potential of a force-feedback mouse to render surfaces varying in roughness. The stimuli were surfaces with alternating regions of high and low resistance to movement in the x (frontal) dimension (called ridges and grooves, respectively). Experiment 1 showed that magnitude ratings of roughness varied systematically with the spatial period of the resistance variation. Experiments 2 and 3 used a factorial design to disentangle the contributions of ridge and groove width. The stimuli constituted eight values of groove width at each of five levels of ridge width (Experiment 2) or the reverse (Experiment 3). Roughness magnitude increased with ridge width while remaining essentially invariant over groove width. Kinematic variations in exploration were observed across the surfaces. The data point to the promise of using inexpensive devices to create virtual textural variations under conditions of unconstrained exploration."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23223","fieldValue":"Ma, Wei-Ying"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23223","fieldValue":" The increasing availability of location-acquisition technologies (GPS, GSM networks, etc.) enables people to log the location histories with spatio-temporal data. Such real-world location histories imply, to some extent, users' interests in places, and bring us opportunities to understand the correlation between users and locations. In this article, we move towards this direction and report on a personalized friend and location recommender for the geographical information systems (GIS) on the Web. First, in this recommender system, a particular individual's visits to a geospatial region in the real world are used as their implicit ratings on that region. Second, we measure the similarity between users in terms of their location histories and recommend to each user a group of potential friends in a GIS community. Third, we estimate an individual's interests in a set of unvisited regions by involving his\/her location history and those of other users. Some unvisited locations that might match their tastes can be recommended to the individual. A framework, referred to as a hierarchical-graph-based similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed to uniformly model each individual's location history, and effectively measure the similarity among users. In this framework, we take into account three factors: 1) the sequence property of people's outdoor movements, 2) the visited popularity of a geospatial region, and 3) the hierarchical property of geographic spaces. Further, we incorporated a content-based method into a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, which uses HGSM as the user similarity measure, to estimate the rating of a user on an item. We evaluated this recommender system based on the GPS data collected by 75 subjects over a period of 1 year in the real world. As a result, HGSM outperforms related similarity measures, namely similarity-by-count, cosine similarity, and Pearson similarity measures. Moreover, beyond the item-based CF method and random recommendations, our system provides users with more attractive locations and better user experiences of recommendation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23223","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23223","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23224","fieldValue":" Searchers on the Web often aim to find key resources about a topic. Finding such results is called topic distillation. Previous research has shown that the use of sources of evidence such as page indegree and URL structure can significantly improve search performance on interconnected collections such as the Web, beyond the use of simple term distribution statistics. This article presents a new approach to improve topic distillation by exploring the use of external sources of evidence: link structure, including query dependent indegree and outdegree; and web page characteristics, such as the density of anchor links. Our experiments with the TREC .GOV collection, an 18GB crawl of the US .gov domain from 2002, show that using such evidence can significantly improve search effectiveness, with combinations of evidence leading to significant performance gains over both full-text and anchor-text baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that, at a different scope level, both local query-dependent outdegree and query-dependent indegree out-performed their global query-independent counterparts; and at the same scope level, outdegree out-performed indegree. Adding query-dependent indegree or page characteristics to query-dependent outdegree could have a small, but not significant, improvement."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23224","fieldValue":"ACM"}
