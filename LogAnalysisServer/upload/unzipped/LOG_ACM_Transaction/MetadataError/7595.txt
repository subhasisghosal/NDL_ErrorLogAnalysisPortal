{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10000","fieldValue":" Traffic matrix is essential to traffic engineering (TE) methods. Because it is difficult to monitor traffic matrices directly, several methods for estimating them from link loads have been proposed. However, estimated traffic matrix includes estimation errors which degrade the performance of TE significantly. In this paper, we propose a method that reduces estimation errors while reconfiguring the virtual network topology (VNT) by cooperating with the VNT reconfiguration. In our method, the VNT reconfiguration is divided into multiple stages instead of reconfiguring the suitable VNT at once. By dividing the VNT reconfiguration into multiple stages, our traffic matrix estimation method calibrates and reduces the estimation errors in each stage by using information monitored in prior stages. We also investigate the effectiveness of our proposal using simulations. The results show that our method can improve the accuracy of the traffic matrix estimation and achieve an adequate VNT as is the case with the reconfiguration using the actual traffic matrices."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10000","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10000","fieldValue":"GMPLS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10000","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10001","fieldValue":" With the growing abundance of portable wireless communication devices, a challenging question that arises is whether one can efficiently harness the collective communication and computation power of these devices. In this paper, we investigate this question by studying a streaming application. Consider a network of N wireless nodes, each of power P, in which one or more nodes are interested in receiving a data stream from a fixed server node S. We ask whether distributed communication mechanisms exist to route media packets from S to the arbitrary but fixed receiver, such that 1) the average communication delay L is short, 2) the load is balanced, i.e., all nodes in the ensemble spend roughly the same amount of average power, and, more importantly, 3) power resources of all nodes are optimally shared, i.e., the lifetime of the network is comparable to an optimally designed network with L nodes whose total power is N Ã\u2014 P. We develop a theoretical framework for incorporation of random long range routes into wireless ad hoc networking protocols that can achieve such performance. Surprisingly, we show that wireless ad hoc routing algorithms, based on this framework, exist that can deliver this performance. The proposed solution is a randomized network structuring and packet routing framework whose communication latency is only $L=O(log^2$ N) hops, on average, compared to O(âˆšN) in nearest neighbor communications while distributing the power requirement almost equally over all nodes. Interestingly, all network formation and routing algorithms are completely decentralized, and the packets arriving at a node are routed randomly and independently, based only on the source and destination locations. The distributed nature of the algorithm allows it to be implemented within standard wireless ad hoc communication protocols and makes the proposed framework a compelling candidate for harnessing collective network resources in a truly large-scale wireless ad hoc networking environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10001","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10002","fieldValue":" In this paper, we investigate the maximization of the coverage time for a clustered wireless sensor network by optimal balancing of power consumption among cluster heads (CHs). Clustering significantly reduces the energy consumption of individual sensors, but it also increases the communication burden on CHs. To investigate this tradeoff, our analytical model incorporates both intra- and intercluster traffic. Depending on whether location information is available or not, we consider optimization formulations under both deterministic and stochastic setups, using a Rayleigh fading model for intercluster communications. For the deterministic setup, sensor nodes and CHs are arbitrarily placed, but their locations are known. Each CH routes its traffic directly to the sink or relays it through other CHs. We present a coverage-time-optimal joint clustering\/routing algorithm, in which the optimal clustering and routing parameters are computed using a linear program. For the stochastic setup, we consider a cone-like sensing region with uniformly distributed sensors and provide optimal power allocation strategies that guarantee (in a probabilistic sense) an upper bound on the end-to-end (inter-CH) path reliability. Two mechanisms are proposed for achieving balanced power consumption in the stochastic case: a routing-aware optimal cluster planning and a clustering-aware optimal random relay. For the first mechanism, the problem is formulated as a signomial optimization, which is efficiently solved using generalized geometric programming. For the second mechanism, we show that the problem is solvable in linear time. Numerical examples and simulations are used to validate our analysis and study the performance of the proposed schemes."}
