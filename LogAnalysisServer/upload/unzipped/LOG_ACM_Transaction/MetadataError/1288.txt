Under special circumstances, however, this intersection may â\u20ACœdegenerateâ\u20AC? into a quartic with a double point, or a composite of lines, conics, and twisted cubics whose degrees, counted over the complex projective domain, sum to four. Such degenerate forms are important since they occur with surprising frequency in practice and, unlike the generic case, they admit rational parameterizations. Invoking concepts from classical algebraic geometry, we formulate the condition for a degenerate intersection in terms of the vanishing of a polynomial expression in the quadric coefficients. When this is satisfied, we apply a multivariate polynomial factorization algorithm to the projecting cone of the intersection curve. Factors of this cone which correspond to intersection components â\u20ACœat infinityâ\u20AC? may be removed a priori. A careful examination of the remaining cone factors then facilitates the identification and parameterization of the various real, affine intersection elements that may arise: isolated points, lines, conics, cubics, and singular quartics. The procedure is essentially automatic (avoiding the tedium of case-by-case analyses), encompasses the full range of quadric forms, and is amenable to implementation in exact (symbolic) arithmetic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15011","fieldValue":"DeRose, Tony D."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15011","fieldValue":" In this paper we introduce a class of surface patch representations, called S-patches, that unify and generalize triangular and tensor product BÃ©zier surfaces by allowing patches to be defined over any convex polygonal domain; hence, S-patches may have any number of boundary curves. Other properties of S-patches are geometrically meaningful control points, separate control over positions and derivatives along boundary curves, and a geometric construction algorithm based on de Casteljau's algorithm. Of special interest are the regular S-patches, that is, S-patches defined on regular domain polygons. Also presented is an algorithm for smoothly joining together these surfaces with Ck continuity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15011","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15011","fieldValue":"ACM"}
