It aims to take advantage of path diversity to achieve efficient bandwidth allocation without causing instability. We develop a multi-path extension to the dual algorithm, which takes into consideration path diversity when evaluating fairness. This algorithm is shown to be globally stable in the absence of propagation delays and a sufficient condition for local stability, for the case when heterogeneous propagation delays are present, is found. The sufficient condition we present is decentralized in the following sense: the gain parameter for each dynamic variable is restricted by the average round-trip time of packets passing through the link or source it represents, but not by the round-trip times of any other packets. This leads to a highly scalable parameter choice scheme. Gain parameters are calculated from local information which is independent of the state of the algorithm, and our delay stability condition is satisfied. The models considered apply to networks consisting of arbitrary interconnections of sources and links with arbitrary heterogeneous propagation delays."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9666","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9666","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9666","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9667","fieldValue":" A common assumption behind most of the recent research on network rate allocation is that traffic flows are elastic, which means that their utility functions are concave and continuous and that there is no hard limit on the rate allocated to each flow. These critical assumptions lead to the tractability of the analytic models for rate allocation based on network utility maximization, but also limit the applicability of the resulting rate allocation protocols. This paper focuses on inelastic flows and removes these restrictive and often invalid assumptions. First, we consider nonconcave utility functions, which turn utility maximization into difficult, nonconvex optimization problems. We present conditions under which the standard price-based distributed algorithm can still converge to the globally optimal rate allocation despite nonconcavity of utility functions. In particular, continuity of price-based rate allocation at all the optimal prices is a sufficient condition for global convergence of rate allocation by the standard algorithm, and continuity at at least one optimal price is a necessary condition. We then show how to provision link capacity to guarantee convergence of the standard distributed algorithm. Second, we model real-time flow utilities as discontinuous functions. We show how link capacity can be provisioned to allow admission of all real-time flows, then propose a price-based admission control heuristics when such link capacity provisioning is impossible, and finally develop an optimal distributed algorithm to allocate rates between elastic and real-time flows."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9667","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9667","fieldValue":"ACM"}
