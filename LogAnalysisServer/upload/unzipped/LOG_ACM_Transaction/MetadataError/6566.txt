Unfortunately, existing knowledge regarding demonstrations is composed of partial qualitative descriptions without complete and precise numerical information. In this article we describe a first attempt to use qualitative reasoning techniques to model demonstrations. To our knowledge, such techniques have never been applied to modeling and reasoning regarding crowd behaviors, nor in particular demonstrations. We develop qualitative models consistent with the partial, qualitative social science literature, allowing us to model the interactions between different factors that influence violence in demonstrations. We then utilize qualitative simulation to predict the potential eruption of violence, at various levels, based on a description of the demographics, environmental settings, and police responses. We incrementally present and compare three such qualitative models. The results show that while two of these models fail to predict the outcomes of real-world events reported and analyzed in the literature, one model provides good results. We also examine whether a popular machine learning algorithm (decision tree learning) can be used. While the results show that the decision trees provide improved predictions, we show that the QR models can be more sensitive to changes, and can account for what-if scenarios, in contrast to decision trees. Moreover, we introduce a novel analysis algorithm that analyzes the QR simulations, to automatically determine the factors that are most important in influencing the outcome in specific real-world demonstrations. We show that the algorithm identifies factors that correspond to experts' analysis of these events."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7497","fieldValue":" We addressed the problem of detecting the change in behavior of information diffusion over a social network which is caused by an unknown external situation change using a small amount of observation data in a retrospective setting. The unknown change is assumed effectively reflected in changes in the parameter values in the probabilistic information diffusion model, and the problem is reduced to detecting where in time and how long this change persisted and how big this change is. We solved this problem by searching the change pattern that maximizes the likelihood of generating the observed information diffusion sequences, and in doing so we devised a very efficient general iterative search algorithm using the derivative of the likelihood which avoids parameter value optimization during each search step. This is in contrast to the naive learning algorithm in that it has to iteratively update the patten boundaries, each requiring the parameter value optimization and thus is very inefficient. We tested this algorithm for two instances of the probabilistic information diffusion model which has different characteristics. One is of information push style and the other is of information pull style. We chose Asynchronous Independent Cascade (AsIC) model as the former and Value-weighted Voter (VwV) model as the latter. The AsIC is the model for general information diffusion with binary states and the parameter to detect its change is diffusion probability and the VwV is the model for opinion formation with multiple states and the parameter to detect its change is opinion value. The results tested on these two models using four real-world network structures confirm that the algorithm is robust enough and can efficiently identify the correct change pattern of the parameter values. Comparison with the naive method that finds the best combination of change boundaries by an exhaustive search through a set of randomly selected boundary candidates shows that the proposed algorithm far outperforms the native method both in terms of accuracy and computation time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7498","fieldValue":" We employ Add Health data to show that friendship networks, constructed from mutual friendship nominations, are important in building weight perception, setting weight goals, and measuring social marginalization among adolescents and young adults. We study the relationship between individuals' perceived weight status, actual weight status, weight status relative to friends' weight status, and weight goals. This analysis helps us understand how individual weight perceptions might be formed, what these perceptions do to the weight goals, and how friends' relative weight affects weight perception and weight goals. Combining this information with individuals' friendship network helps determine the influence of social relationships on weight-related variables. Multinomial logistic regression results indicate that relative status is indeed a significant predictor of perceived status, and perceived status is a significant predictor of weight goals. We also address the issue of causality between actual weight status and social marginalization (as measured by the number of friends) and show that obesity precedes social marginalization in time rather than the other way around. This lends credence to the hypothesis that obesity leads to social marginalization not vice versa. Attributes of the friendship network can provide new insights into effective interventions for combating obesity since adolescent friendships provide an important social context for weight-related behaviors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7498","fieldValue":"ACM"}
