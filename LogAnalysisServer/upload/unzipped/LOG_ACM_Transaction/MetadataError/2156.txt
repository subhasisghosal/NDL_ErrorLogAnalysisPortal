The design is procedurally specified as part of the ordinary modeling workflow by defining goals for the illumination that should be attained and locations where luminaires may be installed to realize these goals. Additionally, constraints can be modeled that make the arrangement of the installed luminaires respect certain aesthetic and structural considerations. From this specification, the system automatically generates a lighting solution for any concrete model instance. The underlying, intricate joint optimization and constraint satisfaction problem is approached with a stochastic scheme that operates directly in the complex subspace where all constraints are observed. To navigate this subspace efficaciously, the actual lighting situation is taken into account. We demonstrate our system on multiple examples spanning a variety of architectural structures and lighting designs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17244","fieldValue":" Multiscale manipulations are central to image editing but also prone to halos. Achieving artifact-free results requires sophisticated edge-aware techniques and careful parameter tuning. These shortcomings were recently addressed by the local Laplacian filters, which can achieve a broad range of effects using standard Laplacian pyramids. However, these filters are slow to evaluate and their relationship to other approaches is unclear. In this article, we show that they are closely related to anisotropic diffusion and to bilateral filtering. Our study also leads to a variant of the bilateral filter that produces cleaner edges while retaining its speed. Building upon this result, we describe an acceleration scheme for local Laplacian filters on gray-scale images that yields speedups on the order of 50Ã\u2014. Finally, we demonstrate how to use local Laplacian filters to alter the distribution of gradients in an image. We illustrate this property with a robust algorithm for photographic style transfer."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17245","fieldValue":" The main challenge in achieving good image morphs is to create a map that aligns corresponding image elements. Our aim is to help automate this often tedious task. We compute the map by optimizing the compatibility of corresponding warped image neighborhoods using an adaptation of structural similarity. The optimization is regularized by a thin-plate spline and may be guided by a few user-drawn points. We parameterize the map over a halfway domain and show that this representation offers many benefits. The map is able to treat the image pair symmetrically, model simple occlusions continuously, span partially overlapping images, and define extrapolated correspondences. Moreover, it enables direct evaluation of the morph in a pixel shader without mesh rasterization. We improve the morphs by optimizing quadratic motion paths and by seamlessly extending content beyond the image boundaries. We parallelize the algorithm on a GPU to achieve a responsive interface and demonstrate challenging morphs obtained with little effort."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17245","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17245","fieldValue":"ACM"}
