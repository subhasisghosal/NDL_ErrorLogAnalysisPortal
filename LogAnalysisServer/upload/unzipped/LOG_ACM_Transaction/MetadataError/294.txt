The need to detect and localize the occurrence of faults at runtime is steadily becoming imperative. In this work, we propose NoCAlert, a comprehensive online and real-time fault detection and localization mechanism that demonstrates 0&percnt; false negatives within the interconnect for the fault models and stimulus set used in this study. Based on the concept of invariance checking, NoCAlert employs a group of lightweight microchecker modules that collectively implement real-time hardware assertions. The checkers operate concurrently with normal NoC operation, thus eliminating the need for periodic, or triggered-based, self-testing. Based on the pattern\/signature of asserted checkers, NoCAlert can pinpoint the location of the fault at various granularity levels. Most important, 97&percnt; of the transient and 90&percnt; of the permanent faults are detected instantaneously, within a single clock cycle upon fault manifestation. The fault localization accuracy ranges from 90&percnt; to 100&percnt;, depending on the desired localization granularity. Extensive cycle-accurate simulations in a 64-node CMP and analysis at the RTL netlist-level demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2086","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2086","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11984","fieldValue":"ACM"}
