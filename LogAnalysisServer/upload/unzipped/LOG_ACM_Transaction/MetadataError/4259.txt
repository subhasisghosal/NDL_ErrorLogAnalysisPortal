We shall adopt a subjectivist Bayesian view of probabilities and argue that classical work on probabilistic retrieval is best understood from this perspective. The main focus of the paper will be the ranking formulas corresponding to the Binary Independence Model (BIM), presented originally by Roberston and Sparck Jones [1977] and the Combination Match Model (CMM), developed shortly thereafter by Croft and Harper [1979]. We will show how these same ranking formulas can result from a probabilistic methodology commonly known as Maximum Entropy (MAXENT)."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/23822","fieldValue":"<italic>idf<\/italic> weighting"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23822","fieldValue":"<italic>idf<\/italic> weighting"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23822","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23822","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23823","fieldValue":" The integration of distributed, heterogeneous databases, such as those available on the World Wide Web, poses many problems. Herer we consider the problem of integrating data from sources that lack common object identifiers. A solution to this problem is proposed for databases that contain informal, natural-language â\u20ACœnamesâ\u20AC? for objects; most Web-based databases satisfy this requirement, since they usually present their information to the end-user through a veneer of text. We describe WHIRL, a â\u20ACœsoftâ\u20AC? database management system which supports â\u20ACœsimilarity joins,â\u20AC? based on certain robust, general-purpose similarity metrics for text. This enables fragments of text (e.g., informal names of objects) to be used as keys. WHIRL includes textual objects as a built-in type, similarity reasoning as a built-in predicate, and answers every query with a list of answer substitutions that are ranked according to an overall score. Experiments show that WHIRL is much faster than naive inference methods, even for short queries, and efficient on typical queries to real-world databases with tens of thousands of tuples. Inferences made by WHIRL are also surprisingly accurate, equaling the accuracy of hand-coded normalization routines on one benchmark problem, and outerperforming exact matching with a plausible global domain on a second."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23823","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23823","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23824","fieldValue":" This paper describes a methodology for the development of WWW applications and a tool environment specifically tailored for the methodology. The methodology and the development environment are based upon models and techniques already used in the hypermedia, information systems, and software engineering fields, adapted and blended in an original mix. The foundation of the proposal is the conceptual design of WWW applications, using HDM-lite, a notation for the specification of structure, navigation, and presentation semantics. The conceptual schema is then translated into a â\u20ACœtraditionalâ\u20AC? database schema, which describes both the organization of the content and the desired navigation and presentation features. The WWW pages can therefore be dynamically generated from the database content, following the navigation requests of the user. A CASE environment, called Autoweb System, offers a set of software tools, which assist the design and the execution of a WWW application, in all its different aspects, Real-life experiences of the use of the methodology and of the AutoWeb System in both the industrial and academic context are reported."}
