This is achieved by treating visibility implicitly and propagating an additional quantity, called antiradiance, to compensate for light transmitted extraneously. Our new algorithm shifts visibility computation to simple local iterations by maintaining additional directional antiradiance information with samples in the scene. It is easy to parallelize on a GPU. By correctly treating discretization and filtering, we can compute indirect illumination in scenes with dynamic objects much faster than traditional methods. Our results show interactive update of indirect illumination with moving characters and lights."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15817","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15817","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15817","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15818","fieldValue":" Blockwise or Clustered Principal Component Analysis (CPCA) is commonly used to achieve real-time rendering of shadows and glossy reflections with precomputed radiance transfer (PRT). The vertices or pixels are partitioned into smaller coherent regions, and light transport in each region is approximated by a locally low-dimensional subspace using PCA. Many earlier techniques such as surface light field and reflectance field compression use a similar paradigm. However, there has been no clear theoretical understanding of how light transport dimensionality increases with local patch size, nor of the optimal block size or number of clusters. In this paper, we develop a theory of locally low dimensional light transport, by using Szego's eigenvalue theorem to analytically derive the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix for canonical cases. We show mathematically that for symmetric patches of area A, the number of basis functions for glossy reflections increases linearly with A, while for simple cast shadows, it often increases as âˆšA. These results are confirmed numerically on a number of test scenes. Next, we carry out an analysis of the cost of rendering, trading off local dimensionality and the number of patches, deriving an optimal block size. Based on this analysis, we provide useful practical insights for setting parameters in CPCA and also derive a new adaptive subdivision algorithm. Moreover, we show that rendering time scales sub-linearly with the resolution of the image, allowing for interactive all-frequency relighting of 1024 x 1024 images."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15819","fieldValue":" We present a symmetrization algorithm for geometric objects. Our algorithm enhances approximate symmetries of a model while minimally altering its shape. Symmetrizing deformations are formulated as an optimization process that couples the spatial domain with a transformation configuration space, where symmetries can be expressed more naturally and compactly as parametrized point-pair mappings. We derive closed-form solution for the optimal symmetry transformations, given a set of corresponding sample pairs. The resulting optimal displacement vectors are used to drive a constrained deformation model that pulls the shape towards symmetry. We show how our algorithm successfully symmetrizes both the geometry and the discretization of complex 2D and 3D shapes and discuss various applications of such symmetrizing deformations."}
