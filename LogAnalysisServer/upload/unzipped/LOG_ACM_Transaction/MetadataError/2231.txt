Our algorithm produces meshes with high isotropy while naturally aligning and snapping edges to sharp features. The method is simple to implement and parallelize, and it can process a variety of input surface representations, such as point clouds, range scans and triangle meshes. Our full pipeline executes instantly (less than a second) on meshes with hundreds of thousands of faces, enabling new types of interactive workflows. Since our algorithm avoids any global optimization, and its key steps scale linearly with input size, we are able to process extremely large meshes and point clouds, with sizes exceeding several hundred million elements. To demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method, we apply it to hundreds of models of varying complexity and provide our cross-platform reference implementation in the supplemental material."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17425","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17425","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17426","fieldValue":" Injective parameterizations of surface meshes are vital for many applications in Computer Graphics, Geometry Processing and related fields. Tutte's embedding, and its generalization to convex combination maps, are among the most popular approaches for computing parameterizations of surface meshes into the plane, as they guarantee injectivity, and their computation only requires solving a sparse linear system. However, they are only applicable to disk-type and toric surface meshes. In this paper we suggest a generalization of Tutte's embedding to other surface topologies, and in particular the common, yet untreated case, of sphere-type surfaces. The basic idea is to enforce certain boundary conditions on the parameterization so as to achieve a Euclidean orbifold structure. The orbifold-Tutte embedding is a seamless, globally bijective parameterization that, similarly to the classic Tutte embedding, only requires solving a sparse linear system for its computation. In case the cotangent weights are used, the orbifold-Tutte embedding globally minimizes the Dirichlet energy and is shown to approximate conformal and four-point quasiconformal mappings. As far as we are aware, this is the first fully-linear method that produces bijective approximations to conformal mappings. Aside from parameterizations, the orbifold-Tutte embedding can be used to generate bijective inter-surface mappings with three or four landmarks and symmetric patterns on sphere-type surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17426","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17426","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2648","fieldValue":" Given a graph G and an integer k, the Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) problem asks if there is a vertex set T of size at most k that hits all cycles in the graph. The first fixed-parameter algorithm for FVS in undirected graphs appeared in a monograph of Mehlhorn in 1984. The fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) status of FVS in directed graphs was a long-standing open problem until Chen et al. (STOC â\u20AC™08, JACM â\u20AC™08) showed that it is fixed-parameter tractable by giving a $4^kk&excl; Â· nO(1) time algorithm. There are two subset versions of this problems: We are given an additional subset S of vertices (resp., edges), and we want to hit all cycles passing through a vertex of S (resp., an edge of S); the two variants are known to be equivalent in the parameterized sense. Recently, the Subset FVS problem in undirected graphs was shown to be FPT by Cygan et al. (ICALPâ\u20AC™11, SIDMAâ\u20AC™13) and independently by Kakimura et al. (SODA â\u20AC™12). We generalize the result of Chen et al. (STOC â\u20AC™08, JACM â\u20AC™08) by showing that a Subset FVS in directed graphs can be solved in time 2O(k3)Ä\u2039nO(1) (i.e., FPT parameterized by size k of the solution). By our result, we complete the picture for FVS problems and their subset versions in undirected and directed graphs. The technique of random sampling of important separators was used by Marx and Razgon (STOC â\u20AC™11, SICOMP â\u20AC™14) to show that Undirected Multicut is FPT, and it was generalized by Chitnis et al. (SODA â\u20AC™12, SICOMP â\u20AC™13) to directed graphs to show that Directed Multiway Cut is FPT. In addition to proving the FPT of a Directed Subset FVS, we reformulate the random sampling of important separators technique in an abstract way that can be used with a general family of transversal problems. We believe this general approach will be useful for showing the FPT of other problems in directed graphs. Moreover, we modify the probability distribution used in the technique to achieve better running time; in particular, this gives an improvement from 22O(k) to 2O(k2)$ in the parameter dependence of the Directed Multiway Cut algorithm of Chitnis et al. (SODA â\u20AC™12, SICOMP â\u20AC™13)."}
