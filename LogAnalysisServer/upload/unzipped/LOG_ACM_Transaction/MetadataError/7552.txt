In active probing, PASTA is invoked to justify the sending of probe packets (or trains) at Poisson times in a variety of contexts. However, due to the diversity of aims and analysis techniques used in active probing, the benefits of Poisson-based measurement, and the utility and role of PASTA, are unclear. Using a combination of rigorous results and carefully constructed examples and counterexamples, we map out the issues involved and argue that PASTA is of very limited use in active probing. In particular, Poisson probes are not unique in their ability to sample without bias. Furthermore, PASTA ignores the issue of estimation variance and the central need for an inversion phase to estimate the quantity of interest based on what is directly observable. We give concrete examples of when Poisson probes should not be used, explain why, and offer initial guidelines on suitable alternative sending processes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9911","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9911","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9911","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8389","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9912","fieldValue":"Ahn, Yong-Yeol"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9912","fieldValue":" User generated content (UGC), now with millions of video producers and consumers, is re-shaping the way people watch video and TV. In particular, UGC sites are creating new viewing patterns and social interactions, empowering users to be more creative, and generating new business opportunities. Compared to traditional video-on-demand (VoD) systems, UGC services allow users to request videos from a potentially unlimited selection in an asynchronous fashion. To better understand the impact of UGC services, we have analyzed the world's largest UGC VoD system, YouTube, and a popular similar system in Korea, Daum Videos. In this paper, we first empirically show how UGC services are fundamentally different from traditional VoD services. We then analyze the intrinsic statistical properties of UGC popularity distributions and discuss opportunities to leverage the latent demand for niche videos (or the so-called \"the Long Tail\" potential), which is not reached today due to information filtering or other system scarcity distortions. Based on traces collected across multiple days, we study the popularity lifetime of UGC videos and the relationship between requests and video age. Finally, we measure the level of content aliasing and illegal content in the system and show the problems aliasing creates in ranking the video popularity accurately. The results presented in this paper are crucial to understanding UGC VoD systems and may have major commercial and technical implications for site administrators and content owners."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9912","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
