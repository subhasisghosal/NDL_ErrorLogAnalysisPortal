{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17177","fieldValue":" We introduce an approach for sketch classification based on Fisher vectors that significantly outperforms existing techniques. For the TU-Berlin sketch benchmark [Eitz et al. 2012a], our recognition rate is close to human performance on the same task. Motivated by these results, we propose a different benchmark for the evaluation of sketch classification algorithms. Our key idea is that the relevant aspect when recognizing a sketch is not the intention of the person who made the drawing, but the information that was effectively expressed. We modify the original benchmark to capture this concept more precisely and, as such, to provide a more adequate tool for the evaluation of sketch classification techniques. Finally, we perform a classification-driven analysis which is able to recover semantic aspects of the individual sketches, such as the quality of the drawing and the importance of each part of the sketch for the recognition."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17177","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17177","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17178","fieldValue":"Lau, Rynson W H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17178","fieldValue":" We present a data-driven approach to derive part-level segmentation and labeling of free-hand sketches, which depict single objects with multiple parts. Our method performs segmentation and labeling simultaneously, by inferring a structure that best fits the input sketch, through selecting and connecting 3D components in the database. The problem is formulated using Mixed Integer Programming, which optimizes over both the local fitness of the selected components and the global plausibility of the connected structure. Evaluations show that our algorithm is significantly better than the straightforward approaches based on direct retrieval or part assembly, and can effectively handle challenging variations in the sketch."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17178","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17178","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17179","fieldValue":"Golparvar-Fard, Mani"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17179","fieldValue":" We describe a set of tools for analyzing, visualizing, and assessing architectural\/construction progress with unordered photo collections and 3D building models. With our interface, a user guides the registration of the model in one of the images, and our system automatically computes the alignment for the rest of the photos using a novel Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technique; images with nearby viewpoints are also brought into alignment with each other. After aligning the photo(s) and model(s), our system allows a user, such as a project manager or facility owner, to explore the construction site seamlessly in time, monitor the progress of construction, assess errors and deviations, and create photorealistic architectural visualizations. These interactions are facilitated by automatic reasoning performed by our system: static and dynamic occlusions are removed automatically, rendering information is collected, and semantic selection tools help guide user input. We also demonstrate that our user-assisted SfM method outperforms existing techniques on both real-world construction data and established multi-view datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17179","fieldValue":"ACM"}
