In this article, we develop a cluster of uniform randomized trees (URTs) as an efficient indexing structure to perform fast near-duplicate image detection. The main contribution in this article is that we introduce â\u20ACœuniformityâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœrandomnessâ\u20AC? into the indexing construction. The uniformity requires classifying the object images into the same scale subsets. Such a decision makes good use of the two facts in near-duplicate image detection, namely: (1) the number of categories is huge; (2) a single category usually contains only a small number of images. Therefore, the uniform distribution is very beneficial to narrow down the search space and does not significantly degrade the detection accuracy. The randomness is embedded into the generation of feature subspace and projection direction, improveing the flexibility of indexing construction. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more efficient than the popular locality-sensitive hashing and more stable and flexible than the traditional KD-tree."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25632","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25632","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25633","fieldValue":"Yeh, Che-Hua"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25633","fieldValue":"Barsky, Brian A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25633","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a novel personalized ranking system for amateur photographs. The proposed framework treats the photograph assessment as a ranking problem and we introduce the idea of personalized ranking, which ranks photographs considering both their aesthetic qualities and personal preferences. Photographs are described using three types of features: photo composition, color and intensity distribution, and personalized features. An aesthetic prediction model is learned from labeled photographs by using the proposed image features and RBF-ListNet learning algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms in the ranking performance: a Kendall's tau value of 0.432 is significantly higher than those obtained by the features proposed in one of the state-of-the-art approaches (0.365) and by learning based on support vector regression (0.384). To realize personalization in ranking, three approaches are proposed: the feature-based approach allows users to select photographs with specific rules, the example-based approach takes the positive feedback from users to rerank the photograph, and the list-based approach takes both positive and negative feedback from users into consideration. User studies indicate that all three approaches are effective in both aesthetic and personalized ranking."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25633","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25633","fieldValue":"ACM"}
