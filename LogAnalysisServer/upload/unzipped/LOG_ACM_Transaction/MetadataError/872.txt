{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13522","fieldValue":" Embedded memory remains a major bottleneck in current integrated circuit design in terms of silicon area, power dissipation, and performance; however, static random access memories (SRAMs) are almost exclusively supplied by a small number of vendors through memory generators, targeted at rather generic design specifications. As an alternative, standard cell memories (SCMs) can be defined, synthesized, and placed and routed as an integral part of a given digital system, providing complete design flexibility, good energy efficiency, low-voltage operation, and even area efficiency for small memory blocks. Yet implementing an SCM block with a standard digital flow often fails to exploit the distinct and regular structure of such an array, leaving room for optimization. In this article, we present a design methodology for optimizing the physical implementation of SCM macros as part of the standard design flow. This methodology introduces controlled placement, leading to a structured, noncongested layout with close to 100&percnt; placement utilization, resulting in a smaller silicon footprint, reduced wire length, and lower power consumption compared to SCMs without controlled placement. This methodology is demonstrated on SCM macros of various sizes and aspect ratios in a state-of-the-art 28nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology, and compared with equivalent macros designed with the noncontrolled, standard flow, as well as with foundry-supplied SRAM macros. The controlled SCMs provide an average 25&percnt; reduction in area as compared to noncontrolled implementations while achieving a smaller size than SRAM macros of up to 1Kbyte. Power and performance comparisons of controlled SCM blocks of a commonly found 256 Ã\u2014 32 (1 Kbyte) memory with foundry-provided SRAMs show greater than 65&percnt; and 10&percnt; reduction in read and write power, respectively, while providing faster access than their SRAM counterparts, despite being of an aspect ratio that is typically unfavorable for SCMs. In addition, the SCM blocks function correctly with a supply voltage as low as 0.3V, well below the lower limit of even the SRAM macros optimized for low-voltage operation. The controlled placement methodology is applied within a full-chip physical implementation flow of an OpenRISC-based test chip, providing more than 50&percnt; power reduction compared to equivalently sized compiled SRAMs under a benchmark application."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13522","fieldValue":"Power, Area, and Performance Optimization of Standard Cell Memory Arrays Through Controlled Placement"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13523","fieldValue":" With the perennial demand for longer runtime of battery-powered Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs), several techniques have been proposed to increase the battery runtime. One such class of techniques exploiting the battery recovery effect phenomenon claims that performing an intermittent discharge instead of a continuous discharge will increase the usable battery capacity. Several works in the areas of embedded systems and wireless sensor networks have assumed the existence of this recovery effect and proposed different power management techniques in the form of power supply architectures (multiple battery setup) and communication protocols (burst mode transmission) in order to exploit it. However, until now, a systematic experimental evaluation of the recovery effect has not been performed with real battery cells, using high-accuracy battery testers to confirm the existence of this recovery phenomenon. In this article, a systematic evaluation procedure is developed to verify the existence of this battery recovery effect. Using our evaluation procedure, we investigated Alkaline, Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH), and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery chemistries, which are commonly used as power supplies for Wireless Sensor Node (WSN) applications. Our experimental results do not show any evidence of the aforementioned recovery effect in these battery chemistries. In particular, our results show a significant deviation from the stochastic battery models, which were used by many power management techniques. Therefore, the existing power management approaches that rely on this recovery effect do not hold in practice. Instead of a battery recovery effect, our experimental results show the existence of the rate capacity effect, which is the reduction of usable battery capacity with higher discharge power, to be the dominant electrochemical phenomenon that should be considered for maximizing the runtime of WSN applications. We outline power management techniques that minimize the rate capacity effect in order to obtain a higher energy output from the battery."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13524","fieldValue":" The development of enhanced modeling techniques for the simulation of switched-mode Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) DC-DC power converters using circuit averaging is the main focus of this article. The circuit-averaging technique has traditionally been used to model the behavior of PWM DC-DC converters without considering important nonideal characteristics of the switching devices. As a result, most of these existing approaches present simplified models that are ideal or linearized, and do not accurately account for the performance characteristics of the converter. This is especially problematic for low-power applications. In this article, we present an enhanced nonideal behavioral circuit-averaged model that makes the simulation of DC-DC converters both computationally efficient and accurate, thereby presenting an important tool for circuit designers. Experimentally, we show that our Verilog-A-based new model allows for accurate simulation of both Buck- and Boost-type PWM converters operating in either CCM or DCM modes while providing more than one order of magnitude speedup over the transistor-level simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13524","fieldValue":"Accurate Modeling of Nonideal Low-Power PWM DC-DC Converters Operating in CCM and DCM using Enhanced Circuit-Averaging Techniques"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13524","fieldValue":"ACM"}
