We consider fractional multicast streaming, where the multicast stream from the source (origin-server) to any particular receiver (end-user) can be split over multiple paths. The receivers are selfish and noncooperative, but must collaboratively purchase capacities of links in the network, as necessary for delivery of the multicast stream from the source to the individual receivers, assuming that the multicast stream is network-coded. For this multicast capacity allocation (network formation) game, we show that the Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in general. For a 2-tier network model where the receivers must obtain the multicast data from the source through a set of relay nodes, we show that the price of stability is at most 2, and provide a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a Nash equilibrium whose social cost is within a factor of 2 of the socially optimum solution. For more general network models, we show that there exists a 2-approximate Nash equilibrium, whose cost is at most two times the social optimum. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a (2 + ε)-approximate Nash equilibrium for any ε > 0, whose cost is at most two times the social optimum. Simulation studies show that our algorithms generate efficient Nash equilibrium allocation solutions for a vast majority of randomly generated network topologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10593","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10593","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10593","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10594","fieldValue":" In wireless sensor networks, an important research problem is to use a few anchor nodes with known locations to derive the locations of other nodes deployed in the sensor field. A category of solutions for this problem is the iterative localization, which sequentially merges the elements in a network to finally locate them. Here, a network element is different from its definition in iterative trilateration. It can be either an individual node or a group of nodes. For this approach, we identify a new problem called inflexible body merging, whose objective is to align two small network elements and generate a larger element. It is more generalized than the traditional tools of trilateration and patch stitching and can replace them as a new merging primitive. We solve this problem and make the following contributions. 1) Our primitive can tolerate ranging noise when merging two network elements. It adopts an optimization algorithm based on rigid body dynamics and relaxing springs. 2) Our primitive improves the robustness against flip ambiguities. It uses orthogonal regression to detect the rough collinearity of nodes in the presence of ranging noise, and then enumerate flip ambiguities accordingly. 3) We present a condition to indicate when we can apply this primitive to align two network elements. This condition can unify previous work and thus achieve a higher percentage of localizable nodes. All the declared contributions have been validated by both theoretical analysis and simulation results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10594","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10594","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10594","fieldValue":"ACM"}
