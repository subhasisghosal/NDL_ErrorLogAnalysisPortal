{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2005","fieldValue":" Motivated by the challenges of scaling up memory capacity and fully exploiting the benefits of memory compression, we propose Buri, a hardware-based memory compression scheme, which simultaneously achieves cost efficiency, high performance, and ease of adoption. Buri combines (1) a self-contained, ready-to-adopt hardware compression module, which manages metadata compression and memory allocation\/relocation operations; (2) a set of hardware optimization mechanisms, which reduce the area and performance overheads in accommodating the address indirection required by memory compression; and (3) lightweight BIOS\/OS extensions used to handle exceptions. Our evaluation with large memory workload traces shows that Buri can increase capacity by 70&percnt;, in addition to the compression ratio already provided by database software."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2005","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2005","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10999","fieldValue":"Seungjoon Lee"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10999","fieldValue":" IPTV service providers offering Video-on-Demand currently use servers at each metropolitan office to store all the videos in their library. With the rapid increase in library sizes, it will soon become infeasible to replicate the entire library at each office. We present an approach for intelligent content placement that scales to large library sizes e.g., 100 Ks of videos. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer program MIP that takes into account constraints such as disk space, link bandwidth, and content popularity. To overcome the challenges of scale, we employ a Lagrangian relaxation-based decomposition technique combined with integer rounding. Our technique finds a near-optimal solution e.g., within 1%-2% with orders of magnitude speedup relative to solving even the linear programming LP relaxation via standard software. We also present simple strategies to address practical issues such as popularity estimation, content updates, short-term popularity fluctuation, and frequency of placement updates. Using traces from an operational system, we show that our approach significantly outperforms simpler placement strategies. For instance, our MIP-based solution can serve all requests using only half the link bandwidth used by least recently used LRU or least frequently used LFU cache replacement policies. We also investigate the tradeoff between disk space and network bandwidth."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/10999","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Networking and Services Research, AT&T Labs-Research, Florham Park, United States (Gopalakrishnan, Vijay); AT&amp;T Labs.-Res., Bedminster, NJ, USA (Applegate, David; Gopalakrishnan, Vijay); AT&amp;T Labs&#8212;Research, Algorithms and Optimization Research, Florham Park, United States (Applegate, David); Google, New York, NY, USA (Archer, Aaron); Cloud Engineering, Two Sigma Investments, New York, United States (Lee, Seungjoon); Sigma Investments, New York, NY, USA (Seungjoon Lee); Computer Science, UC Riverside, Riverside, United States (Ramakrishnan, K.
