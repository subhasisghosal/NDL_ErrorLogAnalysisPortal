{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18549","fieldValue":" Two square root algorithms (for integer and floating point data types) are presented, which aresimpler and more efficient than standard procedures. These could be effectively used as the basis ofhardware-based square root generators as well as for software implementations. One possible appli-cation for an efficient square root routine would be in calculating trigonometric and exponentialfunctions. (This application may be primarily of academic interest, however, since standard tran-scendental function generators would generally be more efficient.) Three accompanying MC68000implementations of the algorithm for 32-bit integer and IEEE single- and double-precision data areavailable on the CALGO listing. These programs return rounding status in the condition code register,and they exhibit the following approximate runtime performance at 8 MHz: 105-134 ps (integer);180-222 ps (single precision); 558-652 ps (double precision)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18549","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18549","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18550","fieldValue":" Box-bisection is a method for solving nonlinear systems. Space is subdivided into boxes of smallerand smaller diameter, and each subbox is tested for the existence of solutions by a test that eithereliminates it from further consideration or marks it for subdivision. Simple bisection uses a test forthe exclusion of subboxes, but no test that guarantees the existence of a unique solution in a subbox.Using this simple bisection, we show that the passed boxes tend to cluster in geometrical configura-tions whose number is stable under subdivision. This implies for many problems that the workrequired to do simple bisection may be prohibitive. However, improvements may be possible bygrouping clusters and dynamically redefining the box proportions. The restriction to second-degreesystems is sufficient to display this behavior."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18551","fieldValue":" An algorithm is presented for generating random variables from the chi family of distributions withdegrees of freedom parameter LY 2 1.
