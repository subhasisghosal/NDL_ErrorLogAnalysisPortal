In this paper, we present a nonparallel plane proximal classifier (NPPC) ensemble that ensures high classification accuracy of test samples in a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) framework than that of a single NPPC model. For each data set only, a few genes are selected by using a mutual information criterion. Then a genetic algorithm-based simultaneous feature and model selection scheme is used to train a number of NPPC expert models in multiple subspaces by maximizing cross-validation accuracy. The members of the ensemble are selected by the performance of the trained models on a validation set. Besides the usual majority voting method, we have introduced minimum average proximity-based decision combiner for NPPC ensemble. The effectiveness of the NPPC ensemble and the proposed new approach of combining decisions for cancer diagnosis are studied and compared with support vector machine (SVM) classifier in a similar framework. Experimental results on cancer data sets show that the NPPC ensemble offers comparable testing accuracy to that of SVM ensemble with reduced training time on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4621","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4621","fieldValue":"Cancer classification, classifier ensemble, combination of multiple classifiers, microarray data analysis, proximal classifier."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4621","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4621","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4622","fieldValue":" Genetic regulatory networks usually encompass a multitude of complex, interacting feedback loops. Being able to model and analyze their behavior is crucial for understanding their function. However, state space explosion is becoming a limiting factor in the formal analysis of genetic networks. This paper explores a modular approach for verification of reachability properties. A framework for component-based modeling of genetic regulatory networks, based on a modular discrete abstraction, is introduced. Then a compositional algorithm to efficiently analyze reachability properties of the model is proposed. A case study on embryonic cell differentiation involving several hundred cells shows the potential of this approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4622","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4622","fieldValue":"Genetic regulatory network, discrete abstraction, component model, formal verification, reachability, modularity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4622","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4622","fieldValue":"ACM"}
