These constitute either first approximations (for hyperplanes, lines, and balls in $R^d, for d &ges; 3) or improvements over previous approximations achievable in comparable times (for unit disks in the plane). (I) Given a set of n hyperplanes in Rd, a traveling salesman problem (TSP) tour whose length is at most O(1) times the optimal can be computed in O(n) time when d is constant. (II) Given a set of n lines in Rd, a TSP tour whose length is at most O(log 3n) times the optimal can be computed in polynomial time for all d. (III) Given a set of n unit balls in Rd$, a TSP tour whose length is at most O(1) times the optimal can be computed in polynomial time when d is constant."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2717","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2717","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18304","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18304","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18305","fieldValue":"Algorithm 571: Statistics for von Mises' and Fisher's Distributions of Directions: $I_1(x) \/I0 (x), I 1.5(x)\/ I0.5$(x)and Their Inverses [S14]"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18305","fieldValue":"ACM"}
