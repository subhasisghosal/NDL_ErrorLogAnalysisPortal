A majority of fast algorithms for searching the overlaps between a query range (e.g., a genomic variant) and a set of N reference ranges (e.g., exons) has time complexity of O(k + logN), where k denotes a term related to the length and location of the reference ranges. Here, we present a simple but efficient algorithm that reduces k, based on the maximum reference range length. Specifically, for a given query range and the maximum reference range length, the proposed method divides the reference range set into three subsets: always, potentially, and never overlapping. Therefore, search effort can be reduced by excluding never overlapping subset. We demonstrate that the running time of the proposed algorithm is proportional to potentially overlapping subset size, that is proportional to the maximum reference range length if all the other conditions are the same. Moreover, an implementation of our algorithm was 13.8 to 30.0 percent faster than one of the fastest range search methods available when tested on various genomic-range data sets. The proposed algorithm has been incorporated into a disease-linked variant prioritization pipeline for WGS (http:\/\/gnome.tchlab.org) and its implementation is available at http:\/\/ml.ssu.ac.kr\/gSearch."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5206","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5207","fieldValue":"Hsu, Yi-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5207","fieldValue":"Kao, Hung-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5207","fieldValue":" Named-entity recognition (NER) plays an important role in the development of biomedical databases. However, the existing NER tools produce multifarious named-entities which may result in both curatable and non-curatable markers. To facilitate biocuration with a straightforward approach, classifying curatable named-entities is helpful with regard to accelerating the biocuration workflow. Co-occurrence Interaction Nexus with Named-entity Recognition (CoINNER) is a web-based tool that allows users to identify genes, chemicals, diseases, and action term mentions in the Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD). To further discover interactions, CoINNER uses multiple advanced algorithms to recognize the mentions in the BioCreative IV CTD Track. CoINNER is developed based on a prototype system that annotated gene, chemical, and disease mentions in PubMed abstracts at BioCreative 2012 Track I (literature triage). We extended our previous system in developing CoINNER. The pre-tagging results of CoINNER were developed based on the state-of-the-art named entity recognition tools in BioCreative III. Next, a method based on conditional random fields (CRFs) is proposed to predict chemical and disease mentions in the articles. Finally, action term mentions were collected by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). At the BioCreative IV CTD Track, the best F-measures reached for gene\/protein, chemical\/drug and disease NER were 54 percent while CoINNER achieved a 61.5 percent F-measure.
