SPDY, a recently proposed alternative to HTTP, tries to address many of the limitations of HTTP (e.g., multiple connections, setup latency). In this paper, we perform a detailed measurement study to understand the benefits of using SPDY over cellular networks. Through careful measurements conducted over 4 months, we provide a detailed analysis of the performance of HTTP and SPDY, how they interact with the various layers, and their implications on Web design. Our results show that unlike in wired and 802.11 networks, SPDY does not clearly outperform HTTP over cellular networks. We identify negative interactions between the protocols used for Web access (HTTP\/SPDY over TCP) and cellular radio resource management as the underlying cause. Overall performance suffers when devices go through a cellular radio state promotion after an idle period, and the consequent increase in latency. This impacts SPDY more because of the use of a single TCP connection. We conclude that a viable solution has to account for these unique cross-layer dependencies to achieve improved Web performance over cellular networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10846","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10846","fieldValue":"SPDY"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8427","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10847","fieldValue":" We investigate the performance of distributed least-mean square (LMS) algorithms for parameter estimation over sensor networks where the regression data of each node are corrupted by white measurement noise. Under this condition, we show that the estimates produced by distributed LMS algorithms will be biased if the regression noise is excluded from consideration. We propose a bias-elimination technique and develop a novel class of diffusion LMS algorithms that can mitigate the effect of regression noise and obtain an unbiased estimate of the unknown parameter vector over the network. In our development, we first assume that the variances of the regression noises are known a priori. Later, we relax this assumption by estimating these variances in real time. We analyze the stability and convergence of the proposed algorithms and derive closed-form expressions to characterize their mean-square error performance in transient and steady-state regimes. We further provide computer experiment results that illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and support the analytical findings."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10847","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10847","fieldValue":"ACM"}
