{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1994","fieldValue":" When building a compiler for a high-level language, certain intrinsic features of the language must be expressed in terms of the resulting low-level operations. Complex features are often expressed by explicitly weaving together bits of low-level IR, a process that is tedious, error prone, difficult to read, difficult to reason about, and machine dependent. In the Graal compiler for Java, we take a different approach: we use snippets of Java code to express semantics in a high-level, architecture-independent way. Two important restrictions make snippets feasible in practice: they are compiler specific, and they are explicitly prepared and specialized. Snippets make Graal simpler and more portable while still capable of generating machine code that can compete with other compilers of the Java HotSpot VM."}{"fieldName":"dc.format.extent","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1994","fieldValue":""}{"fieldName":"dc.format.extent","informationCode":"ERR_PARSE_JSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1994","fieldValue":""}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10882","fieldValue":" In this paper, we describe a network coding scheme for the Broadcast Erasure Channel with multiple unicast stochastic flows, for a single source transmitting packets to users with per-slot ACK\/NACK feedback. This scheme performs only binary (XOR) operations and involves a network of queues, along with special rules for coding and moving packets among the queues, that ensure instantaneous decodability. Additionally, for the scheme to work, one has to specify which packets to select for encoding at each time, based on the received feedback. Contrary to prior work where this packet selection was explicitly specified a priori, we employ a backpressure-type policy that makes the selection based only on queue backlogs. We next provide a stability region outer bound for arbitrary and erasure patterns and show that this bound effectively coincides with a bound on the system's information-theoretic capacity region (accounting for idle slots). Finally, for and i.i.d. erasures, we provide a policy that achieves the stability outer bound and employs the proposed XOR scheme using a restricted set of coding rules."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10882","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10882","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10882","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10883","fieldValue":"Garcia-Saavedra, Andres"}
