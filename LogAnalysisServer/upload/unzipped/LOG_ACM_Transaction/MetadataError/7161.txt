Each service has quality-of-service (QoS) requirements that are guaranteed to users. Service classes may be defined by the type of service, such as voice, video, or data, as well as the origin and destination of the connection provided to the user. We formulate the optimal pricing problem as a nonlinear integer expected revenue optimization problem. We simultaneously solve for prices and the resource allocations necessary to provide connections with guaranteed QoS. We derive optimality conditions and a solution method for this class of problems, and apply to a realistic model of a multiservice communications network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9142","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9142","fieldValue":"Optimal pricing for multiple services in telecommunications networks offering quality-of-service guarantees"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9142","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9142","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9143","fieldValue":" Several distributed real-time applications (e.g., medical imaging, air traffic control, and video conferencing) demand hard guarantees on the message delivery latency and the recovery delay from component failures. As these demands cannot be met in traditional datagram services, special schemes have been proposed to provide timely recovery for real-time communications in multihop networks. These schemes reserve additional network resources (spare resources) a priori along a backup channel that is disjoint with the primary. Upon a failure in the primary channel, its backup is activated, making the real-time connection dependable. In this paper, we propose a new method of providing backups called segmented backups, in which backup paths are provided for partial segments of the primary path rather than for its entire length, as is done in the existing schemes. We show that our method offers: 1) improved network resource utilization; 2) higher average call acceptance rate; 3) better quality-of-service guarantees on propagation delays and failure-recovery times; and 4) increased flexibility to control the level of fault tolerance of each connection separately. We provide an algorithm for routing the segmented backups and prove its optimality with respect to spare resource reservation. We detail necessary extensions to resource reservation protocol (RSVP) to support our scheme and argue that they increase the implementation complexity of RSVP minimally. Our simulation studies on various network topologies demonstrate that spare resource aggregation methods such as backup multiplexing are more effective when applied to our scheme than to earlier schemes."}
