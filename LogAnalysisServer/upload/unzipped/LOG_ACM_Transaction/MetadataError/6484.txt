{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7248","fieldValue":" Math boxes is a recently introduced pen-based user interface for simplifying the task of hand writing difficult mathematical expressions. Visible bounding boxes around subexpressions are automatically generated as the system detects relevant spatial relationships between symbols including superscripts, subscripts, and fractions. Subexpressions contained in a math box can then be extended by adding new terms directly into its given bounds. When new characters are accepted, box boundaries are dynamically resized and neighboring terms are translated to make room for the larger box. Feedback on structural recognition is given via the boxes themselves. In this work, we extend the math boxes interface to include support for subexpression modifications via a new set of pen-based interactions. Specifically, techniques to expand and rearrange terms in a given expression are introduced. To evaluate the usefulness of our proposed methods, we first conducted a user study in which participants wrote a variety of equations ranging in complexity from a simple polynomial to the more difficult expected value of the logistic distribution. The math boxes interface is compared against the commonly used offset typeset (small) method, where recognized expressions are typeset in a system font near the userâ\u20AC™s unmodified ink. In this initial study, we find that the fluidness of the offset method is preferred for simple expressions but that, as difficulty increases, our math boxes method is overwhelmingly preferred. We then conducted a second user study that focused only on modifying various mathematical expressions. In general, participants worked faster with the math boxes interface, and most new techniques were well received. On the basis of the two user studies, we discuss the implications of the math boxes interface and identify areas where improvements are possible."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7248","fieldValue":"A Dynamic Pen-Based Interface for Writing and Editing Complex Mathematical Expressions With Math Boxes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7248","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7248","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7249","fieldValue":" Statistical topic models have become a useful and ubiquitous tool for analyzing large text corpora. One common application of statistical topic models is to support topic-centric navigation and exploration of document collections. Existing work on topic modeling focuses on the inference of model parameters so the resulting model fits the input data. Since the exact inference is intractable, statistical inference methods, such as Gibbs Sampling, are commonly used to solve the problem. However, most of the existing work ignores an important aspect that is closely related to the end user experience: topic model stability. When the model is either re-trained with the same input data or updated with new documents, the topic previously assigned to a document may change under the new model, which may result in a disruption of end usersâ\u20AC™ mental maps about the relations between documents and topics, thus undermining the usability of the applications. In this article, we propose a novel user-directed non-disruptive topic model update method that balances the tradeoff between finding the model that fits the data and maintaining the stability of the model from end usersâ\u20AC™ perspective. It employs a novel constrained LDA algorithm to incorporate pairwise document constraints, which are converted from user feedback about topics, to achieve topic model stability. Evaluation results demonstrate the advantages of our approach over previous methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7249","fieldValue":"LDA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7250","fieldValue":" Many prior works in recommender systems focus on improving the accuracy of item rating predictions. In comparison, the areas of recommendation interfaces and user-recommender interaction remain underexplored. In this work, we look into the interaction of users with the recommendation list, aiming to devise a method that simplifies content discovery and minimizes the cost of reaching an item of interest. We quantify this cost by the number of user interactions (clicks and scrolls) with the recommendation list. To this end, we propose generalized linear search (GLS), an adaptive combination of the established linear and generalized search (GS) approaches. GLS leverages the advantages of these two approaches, and we prove formally that it performs at least as well as GS. We also conduct a thorough experimental evaluation of GLS and compare it to several baselines and heuristic approaches in both an offline and live evaluation. The results of the evaluation show that GLS consistently outperforms the baseline approaches and is also preferred by users. In summary, GLS offers an efficient and easy-to-use means for content discovery in recommender systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7250","fieldValue":"ACM"}
