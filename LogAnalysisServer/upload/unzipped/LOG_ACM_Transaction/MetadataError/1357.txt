To avoid the high cost of mesh refinement associated with fast variations of visibility across receivers, we propose a new hierarchical algorithm in which partial visibility maps can be computed on the fly, using a convolution technique for emitter-receiver configurations where complex shadows are produced. Other configurations still rely on mesh subdivision to reach the desired accuracy in modeling energy transfer. In our system, therefore, radiosity is represented as a combination of textures and piecewise-constant or linear contributions over mesh elements at multiple hierarchical levels. We give a detailed description of the gather, push\/pull, and display stages of the hierarchical radiosity algorithm, adapted to seamlessly integrate both representations. A new refinement algorithm is proposed, which chooses the most appropriate technique to compute the energy transfer and resulting radiosity distribution for each receiver\/transmitter configuration. Comprehensive error control is achieved by subdividing either the source or receiver in a traditional manner, or by using a blocker subdivision scheme that improves the quality of shadow masks without increasing the complexity of the mesh. Results show that high-quality images are obtained in a matter of seconds for scenes with tens of thousands of polygons."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15194","fieldValue":" This paper presents a simple algorithm for associating a smooth, low-degree polynomial surface with triangulations whose extraordinary mesh nodes are separated by sufficiently many ordinary, 6-valent mesh nodes. Output surfaces are at least tangent continuous and are C2 sufficiently far away from extraordinary mesh nodes; they consist of three-sided BÃ©zier patches of degree 4. In particular, the algorithm can be used to skin a mesh generated by a few steps of Loop's generalization of three-direction box-spline subdivision."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15194","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15194","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15195","fieldValue":" This paper presents a new 3D RGB image compression scheme designed for interactive real-time applications. In designing our compression method, we have compromised between two important goals: high compression ratio and fast random access ability, and have tried to minimize the overhead caused during run-time reconstruction. Our compression technique is suitable for applications wherein data are accessed in a somewhat unpredictable fashion, and real-time performance of decompression is necessary. The experimental results on three different kinds of 3D images from medical imaging, image-based rendering, and solid texture mapping suggest that the compression method can be used effectively in developing real-time applications that must handle large volume data, made of color samples taken in three- or higher-dimensional space."}
