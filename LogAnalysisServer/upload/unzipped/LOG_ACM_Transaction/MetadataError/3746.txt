While this evaluation represents a significant and monumental undertaking, there are a number of issues associated with its design and execution that remain unsettled. Some methodologies used in the evaluation are questionable and may have biased its results. One problem is that the evaluators have published relatively little concerning some of the more critical aspects of their work, such as validation of their test data. The appropriateness of the evaluation techniques used needs further investigation. The purpose of this article is to attempt to identify the shortcomings of the Lincoln Lab effort in the hope that future efforts of this kind will be placed on a sounder footing. Some of the problems that the article points out might well be resolved if the evaluators were to publish a detailed description of their procedures and the rationale that led to their adoption, but other problems would clearly remain.\/par>"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22113","fieldValue":"Testing Intrusion detection systems: a critique of the 1998 and 1999 DARPA intrusion detection system evaluations as performed by Lincoln Laboratory"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22113","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22113","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22114","fieldValue":"Chang, Ho-Yen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22114","fieldValue":" A real-time knowledge-based network intrusion-detection model for a link-state routing protocol is presented for the OSPF protocol. This model includes three layers: a data process layer to parse packets and dispatch data; and event abstractor to abstract predefined real-time events for the link-state routing protocol; and an extended timed finite state machine to express the real-time behavior of the protocol engine and to detect intrusions by pattern matching. The timed FSM, called the JiNao Finite State Machine (JFSM) is extended from the conventional FSM with timed states, multiple timers, and time constraints on state transitions. The JFSM is implemented as a generator that can create and FSM by constructing the configuration file only. The results show that this approach is very effective for detecting real-time intrusions. Our approach can be extended for use in other network protocol intrusion-detection systems, especially for those with known attacks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22114","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22114","fieldValue":"ACM"}
