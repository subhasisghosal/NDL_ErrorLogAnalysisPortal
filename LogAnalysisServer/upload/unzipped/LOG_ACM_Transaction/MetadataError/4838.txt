For news geo-localization, an Ordinal Correlation Consistent Matrix Factorization (OCCMF) model is proposed to maintain the relevance rankings of locations to a specific news document and simultaneously capture intra-relations among locations and documents. To visualize news, we develop a novel method to enrich news documents with appropriate web images. Specifically, multiple queries are first generated from news documents for image search, and then the appropriate images are selected from the collected web images by an intelligent fusion approach based on multiple features. Obtaining the geo-localized and image enriched news resources, we further employ a joint ranking strategy to provide relevant, timely and popular news items as the answer of user searching queries. Extensive experiments on a large-scale news dataset collected from the web demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approaches over related methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25538","fieldValue":" In this survey article, we give an overview of methods for music similarity estimation and music recommendation based on music context data. Unlike approaches that rely on music content and have been researched for almost two decades, music-context-based (or contextual) approaches to music retrieval are a quite recent field of research within music information retrieval (MIR). Contextual data refers to all music-relevant information that is not included in the audio signal itself. In this article, we focus on contextual aspects of music primarily accessible through web technology. We discuss different sources of context-based data for individual music pieces and for music artists. We summarize various approaches for constructing similarity measures based on the collaborative or cultural knowledge incorporated into these data sources. In particular, we identify and review three main types of context-based similarity approaches: text-retrieval-based approaches (relying on web-texts, tags, or lyrics), co-occurrence-based approaches (relying on playlists, page counts, microblogs, or peer-to-peer-networks), and approaches based on user ratings or listening habits. This article elaborates the characteristics of the presented context-based measures and discusses their strengths as well as their weaknesses."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25539","fieldValue":"Zhao, Yi-Liang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25539","fieldValue":"Chua, Tat-Seng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25539","fieldValue":" In location-based social networks (LBSNs), users implicitly interact with each other by visiting places, issuing comments and\/or uploading photos. These heterogeneous interactions convey the latent information for identifying meaningful user groups, namely social communities, which exhibit unique location-oriented characteristics. In this work, we aim to detect and profile social communities in LBSNs by representing the heterogeneous interactions with a multimodality nonuniform hypergraph. Here, the vertices of the hypergraph are users, venues, textual comments or photos and the hyperedges characterize the k-partite heterogeneous interactions such as posting certain comments or uploading certain photos while visiting certain places. We then view each detected social community as a dense subgraph within the heterogeneous hypergraph, where the user community is constructed by the vertices and edges in the dense subgraph and the profile of the community is characterized by the vertices related with venues, comments and photos and their inter-relations. We present an efficient algorithm to detect the overlapped dense subgraphs, where the profile of each social community is guaranteed to be available by constraining the minimal number of vertices in each modality. Extensive experiments on Foursquare data well validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of detecting meaningful social communities and uncovering their underlying profiles in LBSNs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25539","fieldValue":"ACM"}
