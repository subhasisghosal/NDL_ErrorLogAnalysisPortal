As many potential ADRs cannot be detected though premarketing review, drug safety currently depends heavily on postmarketing surveillance. Particularly, current postmarketing surveillance in the United States primarily relies on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). However, the effectiveness of such spontaneous reporting systems for ADR detection is not as good as expected because of the extremely high underreporting ratio of ADRs. Moreover, it often takes the FDA years to complete the whole process of collecting reports, investigating cases, and releasing alerts. Given the prosperity of social media, many online health communities are publicly available for health consumers to share and discuss any healthcare experience such as ADRs they are suffering. Such health-consumer-contributed content is timely and informative, but this data source still remains untapped for postmarketing drug safety surveillance. In this study, we propose to use (1) association mining to identify the relations between a drug and an ADR and (2) temporal analysis to detect drug safety signals at the early stage. We collect data from MedHelp and use the FDA's alerts and information of drug labeling revision as the gold standard to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The experiment results show that health-related social media is a promising source for ADR detection, and our proposed techniques are effective to identify early ADR signals."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7653","fieldValue":"Using Health-Consumer-Contributed Data to Detect Adverse Drug Reactions by Association Mining with Temporal Analysis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7653","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7653","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7654","fieldValue":" With vast amounts of medical knowledge available on the Internet, it is becoming increasingly practical to help doctors in clinical diagnostics by suggesting plausible diseases predicted by applying data and text mining technologies. Recently, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have proved useful as a method for exploring phenotypic associations with diseases. However, since genetic diseases are difficult to diagnose because of their low prevalence, large number, and broad diversity of symptoms, genetic disease patients are often misdiagnosed or experience long diagnostic delays. In this article, we propose a method for ranking genetic diseases for a set of clinical phenotypes. In this regard, we associate a phenotype-gene bipartite graph (PGBG) with a gene-disease bipartite graph (GDBG) by producing a phenotype-disease bipartite graph (PDBG), and we estimate the candidate weights of diseases. In our approach, all paths from a phenotype to a disease are explored by considering causative genes to assign a weight based on path frequency, and the phenotype is linked to the disease in a new PDBG. We introduce the Bidirectionally induced Importance Weight (BIW) prediction method to PDBG for approximating the weights of the edges of diseases with phenotypes by considering link information from both sides of the bipartite graph. The performance of our system is compared to that of other known related systems by estimating Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), Mean Average Precision (MAP), and Kendallâ\u20AC™s tau metrics. Further experiments are conducted with well-known TF Â· IDF, BM25, and Jenson-Shannon divergence as baselines. The result shows that our proposed method outperforms the known related tool Phenomizer in terms of NDCG@10, NDCG@20, MAP@10, and MAP@20; however, it performs worse than Phenomizer in terms of Kendallâ\u20AC™s tau-b metric at the top-10 ranks. It also turns out that our proposed method has overall better performance than the baseline methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7654","fieldValue":"NDCG"}
