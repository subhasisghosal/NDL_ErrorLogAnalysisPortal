Partition-optimization approaches, such as k-means or expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms, are sub-optimal and find solutions in the vicinity of their initialization. This paper proposes a staged approach to specifying initial values by finding a large number of local modes and then obtaining representatives from the most separated ones. Results on test experiments are excellent. We also provide a detailed comparative assessment of the suggested algorithm with many commonly-used initialization approaches in the literature. Finally, the methodology is applied to two datasets on diurnal microarray gene expressions and industrial releases of mercury."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4409","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4409","fieldValue":"Clustering, classification, and association rules, Statistical methods, Singular value decomposition, Multivariate statistics"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1339","fieldValue":" In this article, we explore the topic of extending aggregate computation in distributed networks with self-stabilizing properties to withstand network dynamics. Existing research suggests that fast gossiping algorithms, based on the properties of order statistics applied to families of exponential random variables, are a viable solution for computing functions of the values stored in the network. We focus on the specific case in which network changes and failures occur in batches with a minimum frequency in the order of the diameter of the network. Our contribution consists in two self-stabilizing mechanisms, allowing fast gossiping algorithms to be applicable to dynamic networks with minor increase in resources usage. The resulting algorithms can be deployed in networks exhibiting churn, node stop-failures and resets, and random topological changes. The theoretical results are verified with simulations on synthetic data, showcasing desirable properties for large-scale network designers such as scalability, lack of single points of failure, and anonymity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1339","fieldValue":"ACM"}
