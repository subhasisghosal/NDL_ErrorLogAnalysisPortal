In particular, we use curvature directions to drive the remeshing process, mimicking the lines that artists themselves would use when creating 3D models from scratch. After extracting and smoothing the curvature tensor field of an input genus-0 surface patch, lines of minimum and maximum curvatures are used to determine appropriate edges for the remeshed version in anisotropic regions, while spherical regions are simply point sampled since there is no natural direction of symmetry locally. As a result our technique generates polygon meshes mainly composed of quads in anisotropic regions, and of triangles in spherical regions. Our approach provides the flexibility to produce meshes ranging from isotropic to anisotropic, from coarse to dense, and from uniform to curvature adapted."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15325","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15325","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15326","fieldValue":"Chuang, Yung-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15326","fieldValue":"Goldman, Dan B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15326","fieldValue":" In this paper, we describe a method for extracting shadows from one natural scene and inserting them into another. We develop physically-based shadow matting and compositing equations and use these to pull a shadow matte from a source scene in which the shadow is cast onto an arbitrary planar background. We then acquire the photometric and geometric properties of the target scene by sweeping oriented linear shadows (cast by a straight object) across it. From these shadow scans, we can construct a shadow displacement map without requiring camera or light source calibration. This map can then be used to deform the original shadow matte. We demonstrate our approach for both indoor scenes with controlled lighting and for outdoor scenes using natural lighting."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15326","fieldValue":"ACM"}
