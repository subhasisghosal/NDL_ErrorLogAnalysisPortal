However, decomposing a single photo is highly under-constrained and existing methods require user assistance or handle only simple scenes. In this paper, we compute intrinsic decompositions using several images of the same scene under different viewpoints and lighting conditions. We use multi-view stereo to automatically reconstruct 3D points and normals from which we derive relationships between reflectance values at different locations, across multiple views and consequently different lighting conditions. We use robust estimation to reliably identify reflectance ratios between pairs of points. From these, we infer constraints for our optimization and enforce a coherent solution across multiple views and illuminations. Our results demonstrate that this constrained optimization yields high-quality and coherent intrinsic decompositions of complex scenes. We illustrate how these decompositions can be used for image-based illumination transfer and transitions between views with consistent lighting."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16792","fieldValue":" High dynamic range (HDR) imaging from a set of sequential exposures is an easy way to capture high-quality images of static scenes, but suffers from artifacts for scenes with significant motion. In this paper, we propose a new approach to HDR reconstruction that draws information from all the exposures but is more robust to camera\/scene motion than previous techniques. Our algorithm is based on a novel patch-based energy-minimization formulation that integrates alignment and reconstruction in a joint optimization through an equation we call the HDR image synthesis equation. This allows us to produce an HDR result that is aligned to one of the exposures yet contains information from all of them. We present results that show considerable improvement over previous approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2591","fieldValue":" We present a method for reducing the treewidth of a graph while preserving all of its minimal s-t separators up to a certain fixed size k. This technique allows us to solve s-t Cut and Multicut problems with various additional restrictions (e.g., the vertices being removed from the graph form an independent set or induce a connected graph) in linear time for every fixed number k of removed vertices. Our results have applications for problems that are not directly defined by separators, but the known solution methods depend on some variant of separation. For example, we can solve similarly restricted generalizations of Bipartization (delete at most k vertices from G to make it bipartite) in almost linear time for every fixed number k of removed vertices. These results answer a number of open questions in the area of parameterized complexity. Furthermore, our technique turns out to be relevant for (H, C, K)- and (H, C,â\u2030¤K)-coloring problems as well, which are cardinality constrained variants of the classical H-coloring problem. We make progress in the classification of the parameterized complexity of these problems by identifying new cases that can be solved in almost linear time for every fixed cardinality bound."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2591","fieldValue":"ACM"}
