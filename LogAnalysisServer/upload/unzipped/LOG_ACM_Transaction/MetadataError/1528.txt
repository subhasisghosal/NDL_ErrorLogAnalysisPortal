It belongs to the class of vector subdivision schemes; for each vertex, we have three control points that form a control triangle tangent to the surface instead of one control point. The main advantage of this scheme is that we can choose the values of the normals in the initial vertices which results in more design possibilities. At first sight, it is an approximating scheme because the control points change each iteration. However, the point where the control triangle is tangent to the surface remains the same. Therefore, it is an interpolating scheme. In the regular regions, we use the uniform Powell-Sabin rules, and we develop additional subdivision rules for the new vertices in the neighborhood of extraordinary vertices. The scheme yields $C^1$ continuous surfaces. We also do the convergence analysis based on the eigenproperties of the subdivision matrix and the properties of the characteristic map."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15644","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15644","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15645","fieldValue":" This article demonstrates the definition of subdivision processes in nonlinear geometries such that smoothness of limits can be proved. We deal with curve subdivision in the presence of obstacles, in surfaces, in Riemannian manifolds, and in the Euclidean motion group. We show how to model kinematic surfaces and motions in the presence of obstacles via subdivision. As to numerics, we consider the sensitivity of the limit's smoothness to sloppy computing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15645","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15645","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15646","fieldValue":" We describe forward rasterization, a class of rendering algorithms designed for small polygonal primitives. The primitive is efficiently rasterized by interpolation between its vertices. The interpolation factors are chosen to guarantee that each pixel covered by the primitive receives at least one sample which avoids holes. The location of the samples is recorded with subpixel accuracy using a pair of offsets which are then used to reconstruct\/resample the output image. Offset reconstruction has good static and temporal antialiasing properties. We present two forward rasterization algorithms, one that renders quadrilaterals and is suitable for scenes modeled with depth images like in image-based rendering by 3D warping, and one that renders triangles and is suitable for scenes modeled conventionally. When compared to conventional rasterization, forward rasterization is more efficient for small primitives and has better temporal antialiasing properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15646","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15646","fieldValue":"ACM"}
