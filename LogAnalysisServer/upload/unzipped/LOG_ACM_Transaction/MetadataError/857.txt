However, poor write performance is one of the most critical problems for practical applications of MLC PRAM. In this article, we present two schemes to improve write performance by controlling the target resistance distribution of MLC PRAM cells. First, we propose multiple RESET\/SET operations that relax the target resistance bands of intermediate logic levels with additional RESET\/SET operations, which reduces the program time of intermediate logic levels, thereby improving write performance. Second, we propose a two-step write scheme consisting of lightweight write and idle-time completion write that exploits the fact that hot dirty data tend to be overwritten in a short time period and the MLC PRAM often has long idle times. Experimental results show that the multiple RESET\/SET and two-step write schemes result in an average IPC improvement of 15.7&percnt; and 10.4&percnt;, respectively, on a hybrid DRAM\/PRAM main memory subsystem. Furthermore, their integrated solution results in an average IPC improvement of 23.2&percnt; (up to 46.4&percnt;)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13486","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13486","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13487","fieldValue":" 3D technology for networks-on-chip (NOCs) becomes attractive. It is important to present an effective scheme for 3D stacked NOC router and interconnect testing. A new approach to testing of NOC routers is proposed by classifying the routers. Routers with the same number of input\/output ports fall into the same class. Routers of the same class are identical if their tests are the same. A test packet is delivered to all the identical routers by a simple unicast-based multicast scheme. It is found that the depth of the consumption buffer at each router has great impact on the test delivery time because test application and test delivery for router testing cannot be handled concurrently. Test delivery must set a router to operational mode. A mathematical model is presented to evaluate the impact of consumption buffer depth on the test delivery time. A new and simple test application scheme is proposed for interconnect testing. Some interesting extensions are presented for further test time reduction and thermal considerations. Sufficient experimental results are presented by comparison with one previous method. The proposed method works for single stuck-at, transition, even small delay faults at routers, and single bridging faults at physical, consumption and injection channels."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13487","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13487","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13488","fieldValue":"Ho, Tsung-Yi"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13488","fieldValue":" A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology platform for revolutionizing immunoassays, clinical diagnostics, drug discovery, DNA sequencing, and other laboratory procedures in biochemistry. In most of these applications, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an indispensable step for amplifying specific DNA segments. To reduce the reaction time to meet the requirement of â\u20ACœreal-timeâ\u20AC? applications, multiplexed PCR is widely utilized. In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) DMFBs that integrate photodetectors (i.e., cyberphysical DMFBs) have been developed, which offer the benefits of smaller size, higher sensitivity, and faster result generations. However, current DMFB design methods target optimization in only two dimensions, thus ignoring the 3D two-layer structure of a DMFB. Furthermore, these techniques ignore practical constraints related to the interference between on-chip device pairs, the performance-critical PCR thermal loop, and the physical size of devices. Moreover, some practical issues in real scenarios are not stressed (e.g., the avoidance of the cross-contamination for multiplexed PCR). In this article, we describe an optimization solution for a 3D DMFB and present a three-stage algorithm to realize a compact 3D PCR chip layout, which includes: (i) PCR thermal-loop optimization, (ii) 3D global placement based on Strong-Push-Weak-Pull (SPWP) model, and (iii) constraint-aware legalization. To avoid cross-contamination between different DNA samples, we also propose a Minimum-Cost-Maximum-Flow-based (MCMF-based) method for reservoir assignment. Simulation results for four laboratory protocols demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective for the design and optimization of a 3D chip for multiplexed real-time PCR."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13488","fieldValue":"ACM"}
