However, existing accurate solutions for indoor environments are costly. Radio-Frequency (RF)-based approaches are not suitable for some indoor environments such as factory floors where heavy machinery can cause interference. We propose a low-cost and simple location management system using infrared (IR) leds and the Wii Remote Controller (WRC) which has an IR camera. The proposed solution is motivated by the need to find the location of a mobile robot used for data collection in a wireless sensor network. In the proposed schemes, the WRC is placed vertically on the mobile robot pointing upward and IR leds are placed irregularly on the ceiling. The mobile robot determines its position using the relative positions of the IR leds detected by the WRC. The WRC senses a few IR leds at a time, and they are differentiated using the irregularity among them. We analyze the problem theoretically and show that there exist limitations for covering large areas. We also discuss how to overcome these limitations. For small coverage areas, we provide optimal solutions using linear programming. The proposed scheme uses the resources efficiently and can cover a large area using a single WRC and multiple IR leds. We have simulation results including nonvertical placements of the WRC. The proposed scheme is easy to implement and requires minimal bandwidth for location management."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21514","fieldValue":"Michaelides, Michalis P"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21514","fieldValue":"Panayiotou, Christos G"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21514","fieldValue":" The provision of accurate and reliable localization and tracking information for a target moving inside a binary Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is quite challenging, especially when sensor failures due to hardware and\/or software malfunctions or adversary attacks are considered. Most tracking algorithms assume fault-free scenarios and exploit all binary sensor observations, thus their accuracy may degrade when faults are present in the field. Spatiotemporal information available while the target is traversing the sensor field can be used not only for tracking the target, but also for detecting certain types of faults that appear highly correlated both in time and space. Our main contribution is ftTRACK, a target tracking architecture that is resilient to sensor faults and consists of three main components, namely the sensor health-state estimator, a fault-tolerant localization algorithm, and a location smoothing component. The key idea in the ftTRACK architecture lies in the sensor health-state estimator that leverages spatiotemporal information from previous estimation steps to intelligently choose which sensors to employ in the localization and tracking tasks. Simulation results indicate that ftTRACK maintains a high level of tracking accuracy, even when a large number of sensors fail."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21514","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21514","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21515","fieldValue":" Node mobility is a key feature of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in many sensory applications, such as healthcare. The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol should properly support the mobility in the network. In particular, mobility is complicated for contention-free protocols like Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA). An efficient access to the shared medium is scheduled based on the node's local neighborhood. This neighborhood may vary over time due to node movement or other dynamics. In scenarios including body-area networking, for instance, some clusters of nodes move together, creating further challenges but also opportunities. This article presents a MAC protocol, MCMAC, that provides efficient support for cluster mobility in TDMA-based MAC protocols in WSNs. The proposed protocol exploits a hybrid contention-free and contention-based communication approach to support cluster mobility. This relieves the protocol from rescheduling demand due to frequent node movements. Moreover, we propose a listening scheduling mechanism to avoid idle listening to mobile nodes that leads to a considerable energy saving for sensor nodes. The protocol is validated by performing several experiments in a real-world large-scale deployment including several mobile clusters. The protocol is also evaluated by extensive simulation of networks with various scales and configurations."}
