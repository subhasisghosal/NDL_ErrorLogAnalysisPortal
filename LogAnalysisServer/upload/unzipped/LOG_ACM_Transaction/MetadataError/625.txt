The chip is migrated from its previous generation that is for a twin-well process. Due to the design reuse, VDD and GND are designed as global nets but they are not globally connected across the entire chip. The standard LVS flow is unable to handle the additional design complexity and there seems to be no published literature tackling the problem. This paper presents a two-phase LVS methodology: a standard LVS phase where power and ground nets are defined as global nets and a multi-power-domain LVS phase where power and ground nets are treated as local nets. The first phase involves verifying LVS at the block level as well as the full-chip level. The second phase aims at verifying the integrity of the multi-power-domain power grid that is not covered in the first phase LVS. The proposed LVS methodology was successfully verified by real silicon."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12964","fieldValue":"LVS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12964","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12964","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12965","fieldValue":" A wide range of fault tolerance methods for FPGAs have been proposed. Approaches range from simple architectural redundancy to fully on-line adaptive implementations. The applications of these methods also differ; some are used only for manufacturing yield enhancement, while others can be used in-system. This survey attempts to provide an overview of the current state of the art for fault tolerance in FPGAs. It is assumed that faults have been previously detected and diagnosed; the methods presented are targeted towards tolerating the faults. A detailed description of each method is presented. Where applicable, the methods are compared using common metrics. Results are summarized to present a succinct, comprehensive comparison of the different approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12965","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12965","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12965","fieldValue":"ACM"}
