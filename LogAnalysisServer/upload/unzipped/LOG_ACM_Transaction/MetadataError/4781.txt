While most such algorithm design assumes a single file\/layer being multicast, layered coding introduces new challenges into the paradigm due to its cumulative decoding nature. Layered coding is designed to handle heterogeneity in receiver capacities, and a node may decode layer k only if it successfully receives all layers in 1..k. We show that recently proposed optimization models for layered multicast do not correctly address this challenge. We argue that in order to achieve the absolute maximum throughput (or minimum cost), it is necessary to decouple the application-layer throughput from network-layer throughput. In particular, a node should be able to receive a nonconsecutive layer or a partial layer even if it cannot decode and utilize it (e.g., for playback in media streaming applications). The rationale is that nodes at critical network locations need to receive data just for helping other peers. We present a mathematical programming model that addresses these challenges and achieves absolute optimal performance. Simulation results show considerable throughput gain (cost reduction) compared with previous models, in a broad range of network scenarios. We then provide a formal proof that the layered multicast problem is NP-complete. We design a randomized rounding algorithm to approximate the optimal layered multicast, and show the efficacy of our technique using simulations. We then proceed to further generalize our model by studying the optimal progression of layer sizes. We show that such optimization is nonconvex, and apply a simulated annealing algorithm to solve it, with flexible trade-off between solution quality and running time. We verify the effectiveness of the new model and the simulated annealing algorithm through extensive simulations, and point out insights on the connection between optimal layer size progression and node capacity distribution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25392","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25392","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25393","fieldValue":"Hsu, Cheng-Hsin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25393","fieldValue":" Many mobile TV standards dictate using energy saving schemes to increase the viewing time on mobile devices, since mobile receivers are battery powered. The most common scheme for saving energy is to make the base station broadcast the video data of a TV channel in bursts with a bit-rate much higher than the encoding rate of the video stream, which enables mobile devices to turn off their radio frequency circuits when not receiving bursts. Broadcasting TV channels in bursts, however, increases channel switching delay. The switching delay is important, because long and variable switching delays are annoying to users and may turn them away from the mobile TV service. In this article, we first analyze the burst broadcasting scheme currently used in many deployed mobile TV networks, and we show that it is not efficient in terms of controlling the channel switching delay. We then propose new schemes to guarantee that a given maximum switching delay is not exceeded and that the energy consumption of mobile devices is minimized. We prove the correctness of the proposed schemes and analytically analyze the achieved energy saving. We also use scalable video coding to generalize the proposed schemes in order to support mobile devices with heterogeneous resources. We implement the proposed schemes in a mobile TV testbed to show their practicality and to validate our theoretical analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed schemes: (i) significantly increase the energy saving achieved on mobile devices: up to 95&percnt; saving is observed, and (ii) support both homogeneous and heterogeneous mobile devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25393","fieldValue":"DVB-H"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25393","fieldValue":"Using simulcast and scalable video coding to efficiently control channel switching delay in mobile tv broadcast networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25393","fieldValue":"ACM"}
