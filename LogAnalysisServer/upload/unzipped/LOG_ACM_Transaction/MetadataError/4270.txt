For example, during index construction for text databases a record is held for each distinct word in the text, containing the word itself and information such as counters. We propose a new data structure, the burst trie, that has significant advantages over existing options for such applications: it uses about the same memory as a binary search tree; it is as fast as a trie; and, while not as fast as a hash table, a burst trie maintains the strings in sorted or near-sorted order. In this paper we describe burst tries and explore the parameters that govern their performance. We experimentally determine good choices of parameters, and compare burst tries to other structures used for the same task, with a variety of data sets. These experiments show that the burst trie is particularly effective for the skewed frequency distributions common in text collections, and dramatically outperforms all other data structures for the task of managing strings while maintaining sort order."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23849","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23849","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3316","fieldValue":"Yang, Guang-Zhong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3316","fieldValue":" Visual realism has been a major objective of computer graphics since the inception of the field. However, the perception of visual realism is not a well-understood process and is usually attributed to a combination of visual cues and image features that are difficult to define or measure. For highly complex images, the problem is even more involved. The purpose of this paper is to present a study based on eye tracking for investigating the perception of visual realism of static images with different visual qualities. The eye-fixation clusters helped to define salient image features corresponding to 3D surface details and light transfer properties that attract observers' attention. This enabled the definition and categorization of image attributes affecting the perception of photorealism. The dynamics of the visual behavior of different observer groups were examined by analyzing saccadic eye movements. We also demonstrated how the different image categories used in the experiments were perceived with varying degrees of visual realism. The results presented can be used as a basis for investigating the impact of individual image features on the perception of visual realism. This study suggests that post-recall or simple abstraction of visual experience is not accurate and the use of eye tracking provides an effective way of determining relevant features that affect visual realism, thus allowing for improved rendering techniques that target these features."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3316","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3316","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23850","fieldValue":" The success of text-based retrieval motivates us to investigate analogous techniques which can support the querying and browsing of image data. However, images differ significantly from text both syntactically and semantically in their mode of representing and expressing information. Thus, the generalization of information retrieval from the text domain to the image domain is non-trivial. This paper presents a framework for information retrieval in the image domain which supports content-based querying and browsing of images. A critical first step to establishing such a framework is to construct a codebook of \"keywords\" for images which is analogous to the dictionary for text documents. We refer to such \"keywords\" in the image domain as \"keyblocks.\" In this paper, we first present various approaches to generating a codebook containing keyblocks at different resolutions. Then we present a keyblock-based approach to content-based image retrieval. In this approach, each image is encoded as a set of one-dimensional index codes linked to the keyblocks in the codebook, analogous to considering a text document as a linear list of keywords. Generalizing upon text-based information retrieval methods, we then offer various techniques for image-based information retrieval. By comparing the performance of this approach with conventional techniques using color and texture features, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the keyblock-based approach to content-based image retrieval."}
