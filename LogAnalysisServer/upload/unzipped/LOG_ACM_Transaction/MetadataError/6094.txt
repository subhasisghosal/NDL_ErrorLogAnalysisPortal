{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6263","fieldValue":" The design of embedded real-time systems requires skills from multiple specific disciplines, including, but not limited to, control, computer science, and electronics. This often involves experts from differing backgrounds, who do not recognize that they address similar, if not identical, issues from complementary angles. Design methodologies are lacking in rigor and discipline so that demonstrating correctness of an embedded design, if at all possible, is a very expensive proposition that may delay significantly the introduction of a critical product. While the economic importance of embedded systems is widely acknowledged, academia has not paid enough attention to the education of a community of high-quality embedded system designers, an obvious difficulty being the need of interdisciplinarity in a period where specialization has been the target of most education systems. This paper presents the reflections that took place in the European Network of Excellence Artist leading us to propose principles and structured contents for building curricula on embedded software and systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6263","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6263","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6264","fieldValue":"Huang, Tai-Yi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6264","fieldValue":"King, Chung-Ta"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6264","fieldValue":"Lin, Youn-Long Steve"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6264","fieldValue":"Hwang, Yin-Tsung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6264","fieldValue":" The advancement of semiconductor manufacturing technology makes it practical to place a traditional board-level embedded system on a single chip. The evolvement of system-on-chip (SoC) techniques presents new challenges for integrated circuit designs as well as embedded software and systems. To address these challenges, the Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan has been running the VLSI Circuits and Systems Education Program since 1996. This program adopts a top-down approach by forming six domain-specific, intercollegiate consortia. The Embedded Software (ESW) consortium addresses the challenges of embedded software for SoC systems. This paper first introduces the six-consortium architecture and the organization and programs of ESW. We next describe the embedded software curriculum developed by ESW. This curriculum will later be implemented in most universities and colleges in Taiwan to promote the capabilities of embedded software design and implementations. Finally, we present an execution summary of ESW 2004."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6264","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6264","fieldValue":"ACM"}
