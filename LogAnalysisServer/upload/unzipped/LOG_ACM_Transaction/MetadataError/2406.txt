In the conference version [Even et al. 2001] was sketched a 1.5-approximation algorithm for the problem. Since a full proof was very complex and long, the journal version was cut into two parts. The first part [Even et al. 2009] only proved ratio 1.8. An attempt to simplify the second part produced an error in Even et al. [2011]. Here we give a correct, different, and self-contained proof of the ratio 1.5 that is also substantially simpler and shorter than the previous proofs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2697","fieldValue":"ACM"}
