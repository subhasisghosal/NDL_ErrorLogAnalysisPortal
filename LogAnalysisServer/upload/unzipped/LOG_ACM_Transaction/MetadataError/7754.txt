{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10320","fieldValue":" Anonymous wireless networking is studied when an adversary monitors the transmission timing of an unknown subset of the network nodes. For a desired quality of service (QoS), as measured by network throughput, the problem of maximizing anonymity is investigated from a game-theoretic perspective. Quantifying anonymity using conditional entropy of the routes given the adversary's observation, the problem of optimizing anonymity is posed as a two-player zero-sum game between the network designer and the adversary: The task of the adversary is to choose a subset of nodes to monitor so that anonymity of routes is minimum, whereas the task of the network designer is to maximize anonymity by choosing a subset of nodes to evade flow detection by generating independent transmission schedules. In this two-player game, it is shown that a unique saddle-point equilibrium exists for a general category of finite networks. At the saddle point, the strategy of the network designer is to ensure that any subset of nodes monitored by the adversary reveals an identical amount of information about the routes. For a specific class of parallel relay networks, the theory is applied to study the optimal performance tradeoffs and equilibrium strategies. In particular, when the nodes employ transmitter-directed signaling, the tradeoff between throughput and anonymity is characterized analytically as a function of the network parameters and the fraction of nodes monitored. The results are applied to study the relationships between anonymity, the fraction of monitored relays, and the fraction of hidden relays in large networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10320","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10321","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study the problem of identifying constant additive link metrics using linearly independent monitoring cycles and paths. A monitoring cycle starts and ends at the same monitoring station, while a monitoring path starts and ends at distinct monitoring stations. We show that three-edge connectivity is a necessary and sufficient condition to identify link metrics using one monitoring station and employing monitoring cycles. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the set of linearly independent cycles. For networks that are less than three-edge-connected, we show how the minimum number of monitors required and their placement may be computed. For networks with symmetric directed links, we show the relationship between the number of monitors employed, the number of directed links for which metric is known a priori, and the identifiability for the remaining links. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that derives the necessary and sufficient conditions on the network topology for identifying additive link metrics and develops a polynomial-time algorithm to compute linearly independent cycles and paths."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10321","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10322","fieldValue":" It has been shown in a previous version of this paper that hierarchical cooperation achieves a linear throughput scaling for unicast traffic, which is due to the advantage of long-range concurrent transmissions and the technique of distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO). In this paper, we investigate the scaling law for multicast traffic with hierarchical cooperation, where each of the n nodes communicates with k randomly chosen destination nodes. Specifically, we propose a new class of scheduling policies for multicast traffic. By utilizing the hierarchical cooperative MIMO transmission, our new policies can obtain an aggregate throughput of $Î©((n\/k)^1-Îµ) for any Îµ â\u2030¥ 0. This achieves a gain of nearly âˆšn\/k compared to the noncooperative scheme in Li et al.'s work (Proc. ACM MobiCom, 2007, pp. 266-277). Among all four cooperative strategies proposed in our paper, one is superior in terms of the three performance metrics: throughput, delay, and energy consumption. Two factors contribute to the optimal performance: multihop MIMO transmission and converge-based scheduling. Compared to the single-hop MIMO transmission strategy, the multihop strategy achieves a throughput gain of (n\/k)h-1\/h(2h-1) and meanwhile reduces the energy consumption by kÎ±-2\/2 times approximately, where h > 1 is the number of the hierarchical layers, and Î± â\u2030¥ 2 is the path-loss exponent. Moreover, to schedule the traffic with the converge multicast instead of the pure multicast strategy, we can dramatically reduce the delay by a factor of about (n\/k)h\/2$. Our optimal cooperative strategy achieves an approximate delay-throughput tradeoff D(n, k)\/T(n, k) = Î˜(k) when h â\u2020\u2019 âˆž. This tradeoff ratio is identical to that of noncooperative scheme, while the throughput is greatly improved."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10322","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
