Specifically, we show under some polynomial-time reductions that there are complete sets for NEXP that are not autoreducible. We obtain the following main results: ‚\u20AC\u201DFor any positive integers s and k such that $2^s ‚à\u2019 1 > k, there is a $‚\u2030§_s-Tp-complete set for NEXP that is not ‚\u2030§k-ttp-autoreducible. ‚\u20AC\u201DFor every constant c > 1, there is a ‚\u2030§2-Tp-complete set for NEXP that is not autoreducible under nonadaptive reductions that make no more than three queries, such that each of them has a length between n1\/c and nc, where n is input size. ‚\u20AC\u201DFor any positive integer k, there is a ‚\u2030§k-ttp-complete set for NEXP that is not autoreducible under ‚\u2030§k-ttp-reductions whose truth table is not a disjunction or a negated disjunction. Finally, we show that settling the question of whether every ‚\u2030§dttp-complete set for NEXP is ‚\u2030§NOR-tt$p$-autoreducible either positively or negatively would lead to major results about the exponential time complexity classes."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12553","fieldValue":"NEXP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12553","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12553","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12554","fieldValue":" We study the problem ‚ä\u2022HomsToH of counting, modulo 2, the homomorphisms from an input graph to a fixed undirected graph H. A characteristic feature of modular counting is that cancellations make wider classes of instances tractable than is the case for exact (nonmodular) counting; thus, subtle dichotomy theorems can arise. We show the following dichotomy: for any H that contains no 4-cycles, ‚ä\u2022HomsToH is either in polynomial time or is ‚ä\u2022P-complete. This partially confirms a conjecture of Faben and Jerrum that was previously only known to hold for trees and for a restricted class of tree-width-2 graphs called cactus graphs. We confirm the conjecture for a rich class of graphs, including graphs of unbounded tree-width. In particular, we focus on square-free graphs, which are graphs without 4-cycles. These graphs arise frequently in combinatorics, for example, in connection with the strong perfect graph theorem and in certain graph algorithms. Previous dichotomy theorems required the graph to be tree-like so that tree-like decompositions could be exploited in the proof. We prove the conjecture for a much richer class of graphs by adopting a much more general approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12554","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12554","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12555","fieldValue":" The seminal work of Myerson (Mathematics of OR ‚\u20ACô81) characterizes incentive-compatible single-item auctions among bidders with independent valuations. In this setting, relatively simple deterministic auction mechanisms achieve revenue optimality. When bidders have correlated valuations, designing the revenue-optimal deterministic auction is a computationally demanding problem; indeed, Papadimitriou and Pierrakos (STOC ‚\u20ACô11) proved that it is APX-hard, obtaining an explicit inapproximability factor of 1999\/2000 &equals; 99.95&percnt;. In the current article, we strengthen this inapproximability factor to 63\/64 &ap; 98.5&percnt;. Our proof is based on a gap-preserving reduction from the Max-NM 3SAT problem; a variant of the maximum satisfiability problem where each clause has exactly three literals and no clause contains both negated and unnegated literals. We furthermore show that the gap between the revenue of deterministic and randomized auctions can be as low as 13\/14 &ap; 92.9&percnt;, improving an explicit gap of 947\/948 &ap; 99.9&percnt; by Dobzinski, Fu, and Kleinberg (STOC ‚\u20ACô11)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12555","fieldValue":"ACM"}
