As one of the most popular real-time services in the Internet, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) contributes to a large part of network traffic for its advantages of real time, high flow, and low cost. So packet loss is inevitable in multimedia networks and affects the performance of VoIP communications. In this study, a fractal-based VoIP steganographic approach was proposed to realize covert VoIP communications in the presence of packet loss. In the proposed scheme, secret data to be hidden were divided into blocks after being encrypted with the block cipher, and each block of the secret data was then embedded into VoIP streaming packets. The VoIP packets went through a packet-loss system based on Gilbert model which simulates a real network situation. And a prediction model based on fractal interpolation was built to decide whether a VoIP packet was suitable for data hiding. The experimental results indicated that the speech quality degradation increased with the escalating packet-loss level. The average variance of speech quality metrics (PESQ score) between the â\u20ACœno-embeddingâ\u20AC? speech samples and the â\u20ACœwith-embeddingâ\u20AC? stego-speech samples was about 0.717, and the variances narrowed with the increasing packet-loss level. Both the average PESQ scores and the SNR values of stego-speech samples and the data-retrieving rates had almost the same varying trends when the packet-loss level increased, indicating that the success rate of the fractal prediction model played an important role in the performance of covert VoIP communications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25754","fieldValue":" Content-based video understanding is extremely difficult due to the semantic gap between low-level vision signals and the various semantic concepts (object, action, and scene) in videos. Though feature extraction from videos has achieved significant progress, most of the previous methods rely only on low-level features, such as the appearance and motion features. Recently, visual-feature extraction has been improved significantly with machine-learning algorithms, especially deep learning. However, there is still not enough work focusing on extracting semantic features from videos directly. The goal of this article is to adopt unlabeled videos with the help of text descriptions to learn an embedding function, which can be used to extract more effective semantic features from videos when only a few labeled samples are available for video recognition. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel embedding convolutional neural network (ECNN). We evaluate our algorithm by comparing its performance on three challenging benchmarks with several popular state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed ECNN consistently and significantly outperforms the existing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25755","fieldValue":" The application of mobile computing is currently altering patterns of our behavior to a greater degree than perhaps any other invention. In combination with the introduction of power-efficient wireless communication technologies, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), designers are today increasingly empowered to shape the way we interact with our physical surroundings and thus build entirely new experiences. However, our evaluations of BLE and its abilities to facilitate mobile location-based experiences in public environments revealed a number of potential problems. Most notably, the position and orientation of the user in combination with various environmental factors, such as crowds of people traversing the space, were found to cause major fluctuations of the received BLE signal strength. These issues are rendering a seamless functioning of any location-based application practically impossible. Instead of achieving seamlessness by eliminating these technical issues, we thus choose to advocate the use of a seamful approach, that is, to reveal and exploit these problems and turn them into a part of the actual experience. In order to demonstrate the viability of this approach, we designed, implemented, and evaluated the Ghost Detectorâ\u20AC\u201Dan educational location-based museum game for children. By presenting a qualitative evaluation of this game and by motivating our design decisions, this article provides insight into some of the challenges and possible solutions connected to the process of developing location-based BLE-enabled experiences for public cultural spaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25755","fieldValue":"ACM"}
