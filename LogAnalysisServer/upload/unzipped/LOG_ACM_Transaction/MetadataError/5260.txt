Methods that increase the search efficiency and\/or reduce the size of the search space, increase the rate at which useful lead compounds are identified. Artificial neural networks optimized via evolutionary computation provide a cost and time-effective solution to this problem. Here, we present results that suggest preclustering of small molecules prior to neural network optimization is useful for generating models of quantitative structure-activity relationships for a set of HIV inhibitors. Using these methods, it is possible to prescreen compounds to separate active from inactive compounds or even actives and mildly active compounds from inactive compounds with high predictive accuracy while simultaneously reducing the feature space. It is also possible to identify \"human interpretable\" features from the best models that can be used for proposal and synthesis of new compounds in order to optimize potency and specificity."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4311","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4311","fieldValue":"Computational intelligence, evolutionary computation, artificial neural networks, medicine and science"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4311","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4311","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4312","fieldValue":"Huang, Guang-Bin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4312","fieldValue":" In this paper, the recently developed Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used for direct multicategory classification problems in the cancer diagnosis area. ELM avoids problems like local minima, improper learning rate and overfitting commonly faced by iterative learning methods and completes the training very fast. We have evaluated the multi-category classification performance of ELM on three benchmark microarray datasets for cancer diagnosis, namely, the GCM dataset, the Lung dataset and the Lymphoma dataset. The results indicate that ELM produces comparable or better classification accuracies with reduced training time and implementation complexity compared to artificial neural networks methods like conventional back-propagation ANN, Linder's SANN, and Support Vector Machine methods like SVM-OVO and Ramaswamy's SVM-OVA. ELM also achieves better accuracies for classification of individual categories."}
