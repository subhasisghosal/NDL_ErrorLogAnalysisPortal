Water drops refract most incident light, making them excellent wide-angle lenses. Each 2D layer of our display can exhibit arbitrary visual content, creating a layered-depth (2.5D) display. Our system consists of a single projector-camera system and a set of linear drop generator manifolds that are tightly synchronized and controlled using a computer. Following the principles of fluid mechanics, we are able to accurately generate and control drops so that, at any time instant, no two drops occupy the same projector pixel's line-of-sight. This drop control is combined with an algorithm for space-time division of projector light rays. Our prototype system has up to four layers, with each layer consisting of an row of 50 drops that can be generated at up to 60 Hz. The effective resolution of the display is 50x projector vertical-resolution x number of layers. We show how this water drop display can be used for text, videos, and interactive games."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16282","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16282","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16283","fieldValue":" We introduce an interactive, portable, and inexpensive solution for estimating refractive errors in the human eye. While expensive optical devices for automatic estimation of refractive correction exist, our goal is to greatly simplify the mechanism by putting the human subject in the loop. Our solution is based on a high-resolution programmable display and combines inexpensive optical elements, interactive GUI, and computational reconstruction. The key idea is to interface a lenticular view-dependent display with the human eye in close range - a few millimeters apart. Via this platform, we create a new range of interactivity that is extremely sensitive to parameters of the human eye, like refractive errors, focal range, focusing speed, lens opacity, etc. We propose several simple optical setups, verify their accuracy, precision, and validate them in a user study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16283","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16283","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16284","fieldValue":" Conformal maps are considered very desirable for planar deformation applications, since they allow only local rotations and scale, avoiding shear and other visually disturbing distortions of local detail. Conformal maps are also orientation-preserving $C^âˆž$ diffeomorphisms, meaning they are extremely smooth and prevent unacceptable \"foldovers\" in the plane. Unfortunately, these maps are also notoriously difficult to control, so working with them in an interactive animation scenario to achieve specific effects is a significant challenge, sometimes even impossible. We describe a novel 2D shape deformation system which generates conformal maps, yet provides the user a large degree of control over the result. For example, it allows discontinuities at user-specified boundary points, so true \"bends\" can be introduced into the deformation. It also allows the prescription of angular constraints at corners of the target image. Combining these provides for a very effective user experience. At the heart of our method is a very natural differential shape representation for conformal maps, using so-called \"conformal factors\" and \"angular factors\", which allow more intuitive control compared to representation in the usual spatial domain. Beyond deforming a given shape into a new one at each key frame, our method also provides the ability to interpolate between shapes in a very natural way, such that also the intermediate deformations are conformal. Our method is extremely efficient: it requires only the solution of a small dense linear system at preprocess time and a matrix-vector multiplication during runtime (which can be implemented on a modern GPU), thus the deformations, even on extremely large images, may be performed in real-time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16284","fieldValue":"ACM"}
