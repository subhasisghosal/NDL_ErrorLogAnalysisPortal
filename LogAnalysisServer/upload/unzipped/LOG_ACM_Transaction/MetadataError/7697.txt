{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10205","fieldValue":" Two-phase routing, where traffic is first distributed to intermediate nodes before being routed to the final destination, has been recently proposed for handling widely fluctuating traffic without the need to adapt network routing to changing traffic. Preconfiguring the network in a traffic-independent manner using two-phase routing simplifies network operation considerably. In this paper, we extend this routing scheme by providing resiliency against link failures through end-to-end shared backup path restoration. We view this as important progress toward adding carrier-class reliability to the robustness of the scheme so as to facilitate its future deployment in Internet service provider (ISP) networks. In shared backup path restoration, each connection consists of a link-disjoint primary and backup path pair; two backup paths can share bandwidth on their common links if their primary paths are link-disjoint. We show that the optimization problem for maximum throughput two-phase routing with shared backup path restoration is NP-hard. Assuming an approximation oracle for a certain disjoint paths problem (called SBPR-DISJOINT-PATHS, which is also NP-hard) involving the dual variables of a path indexed linear programming formulation for the problem, we design a combinatorial algorithm with provable guarantees. We also provide heuristics for finding approximating solutions to the SBPR-DISJOINT-PATHS problem. We evaluate the throughput performance and number of intermediate nodes in two-phase routing for the above and other restoration mechanisms for two-phase routing on actual ISP topologies collected for the Rocketfuel project and three research network topologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10205","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10206","fieldValue":"Choi, Chong-Ho"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10206","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose Period-Controlled Medium Access Control (PC-MAC), which can operate in pseudo-TDMA manner and achieves high throughput and fairness in simple networks. PC-MAC works like CSMA\/CA initially and becomes a pseudo-TDMA scheme in a few seconds due to the periodic backoff mechanism along with the contention control that tries to maintain the number of idle slots to an optimal level. Simulation results show 10%-50% higher throughput than distributed coordination function (DCF), depending on the number of nodes, while maintaining nearly perfect fairness. Furthermore, we also show how PC-MAC can successfully be applied to complex networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10206","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8401","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
