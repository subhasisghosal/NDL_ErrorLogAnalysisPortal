We defined criteria for delimiting this Web based on our past experience of crawling pages related to Portugal and collected over 3.2 million documents from 46,000 sites satisfying those criteria. Our characterization was derived from this crawl. We describe the rules that we established for defining the boundaries of this community Web and the methodology used to gather statistics. Statistics cover the number and domain distribution of sites; the number, type and size distribution of text documents; and the linkage structure of this Web. We also show how crawling constraints and abnormal situations on the Web can influence the statistics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24321","fieldValue":" We design an adaptive admission control mechanism, network early warning system (NEWS), to protect servers and networks from flash crowds and maintain high performance for end-users. NEWS detects flash crowds from performance degradation in responses and mitigates flash crowds by admitting incoming requests adaptively. We evaluate NEWS performance with both simulations and testbed experiments. We first investigate a network-limited scenarion in simulations. We find that NEWS detects flash crowds within 20 seconds. By discarding 32&percent; of incoming requests, NEWS protects the target server and networks from overloading, reducing the response packet drop rate from 25&percent; to 2&percent;. For admitted requests, NEWS increases their response rate by two times. This performance is similar to the best static rate limiter deployed in the same scenario. We also investigate the impact of detection intervals on NEWS performance, showing it affects both detection delay and false alarm rate. We further consider a server memory-limited scenario in testbed experiments, confirming that NEWS is also effective in this case. We also examine the runtime cost of NEWS traffic monitoring in practice and find that it consumes little CPU time and relatively small memory. Finally, we show NEWS effectively protects bystander traffic from flash crowds."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24322","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24322","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3358","fieldValue":" We propose a novel skin shader which translates the simulation of subsurface scattering from texture space to a screen-space diffusion approximation. It naturally scales well while maintaining a perceptually plausible result. This technique allows us to ensure real-time performance even when several characters may appear on screen at the same time. The visual realism of the resulting images is validated using a subjective psychophysical preference experiment. Our results show that, independent of distance and light position, the images rendered using our novel shader have as high visual realism as a previously developed physically-based shader."}
