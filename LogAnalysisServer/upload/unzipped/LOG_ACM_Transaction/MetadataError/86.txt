Although locality-awareness can lead to high performance, supporting the PGAS memory model is associated with penalties that can hinder PGASâ\u20AC™s potential for scalability and speed of execution. This is because mapping the PGAS memory model to the underlying system requires a mapping process that is done in software, thereby introducing substantial overhead for shared accesses even when they are local. Compiler optimizations have not been sufficient to offset this overhead. On the other hand, manual code optimizations can help, but this eliminates the productivity edge of PGAS. This article proposes a processor microarchitecture extension that can perform such address mapping in hardware with nearly no performance overhead. These extensions are then availed to compilers through extensions to the processor instructions. Thus, the need for manual optimizations is eliminated and the productivity of PGAS languages is unleashed. Using Unified Parallel C (UPC), a PGAS language, we present a case study of a prototype compiler and architecture support. Two different implementations of the system were realized. The first uses a full-system simulator, gem5, which evaluates the overall performance gain of the new hardware support. The second uses an FPGA Leon3 soft-core processor to verify implementation feasibility and to parameterize the cost of the new hardware. The new instructions show promising results on all tested codes, including the NAS Parallel Benchmark kernels in UPC. Performance improvements of up to 5.5Ã\u2014 for unmodified codes, sometimes surpassing hand-optimized performance, were demonstrated. We also show that our four-core FPGA prototype requires less than 2.4&percnt; of the overall chipâ\u20AC™s area."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2024","fieldValue":"PGAS"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2024","fieldValue":"UPC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11207","fieldValue":" Web development is an important component in the curriculum of computer science and information systems areas. However, it is generally considered difficult to learn among students. In this study, we examined factors that could influence students' perceptions of accomplishment and enjoyment and their intention to learn in the web development course. Specifically, we investigated both student-related and instructor-related factors. A research model was developed. To empirically test the model and the hypotheses, the survey method was used and the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was adopted for data analysis. Overall, the results indicated that both student-related factors (perceived web development efficacy and motivation) and instructor-related factors (instructor characteristics and teaching method) could significantly influence students' perceptions toward accomplishment and enjoyment and their intention to learn web development. We also summarized comments collected from students to gain a deeper understanding of their ideas toward learning web development techniques. We believe the research results can help provide better knowledge and insights to educators on teaching web development."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11207","fieldValue":"Investigating Essential Factors on Students' Perceived Accomplishment and Enjoyment and Intention to Learn in Web Development"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11207","fieldValue":"ACM"}
