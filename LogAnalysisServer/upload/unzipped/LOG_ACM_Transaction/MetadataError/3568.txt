{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21592","fieldValue":" This article describes iDiary, a system that takes as input GPS data streams generated by usersâ\u20AC™ phones and turns them into textual descriptions of the trajectories. The system features a user interface similar to Google Search that allows users to type text queries on their activities (e.g., â\u20ACœWhere did I buy books?â\u20AC?) and receive textual answers based on their GPS signals. iDiary uses novel algorithms for semantic compression and trajectory clustering of massive GPS signals in parallel to compute the critical locations of a user. We encode these problems as follows. The k-segment mean is a k-piecewise linear function that minimizes the regression distance to the signal. The (k,m)-segment mean has an additional constraint that the projection of the k segments on $R^d$ consists of only m â\u2030¤ k segments. A coreset for this problem is a smart compression of the input signal that allows computation of a (1+&varepsilon;)-approximation to its k-segment or (k,m)-segment mean in O(nlogn) time for arbitrary constants &varepsilon;, k, and m. We use coresets to obtain a parallel algorithm that scans the signal in one pass, using space and update time per point that is polynomial in log n. Using an external database, we then map these locations to textual descriptions and activities so that we can apply text mining techniques on the resulting data (e.g., LSA or transportation mode recognition). We provide experimental results for both the system and algorithms and compare them to existing commercial and academic state of the art. This is the first GPS system that enables text-searchable activities from GPS data."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21592","fieldValue":"GPS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21592","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21592","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21593","fieldValue":" This article investigates the joint application of compressive sensing (CS) and network coding (NC) to the problem of energy-efficient data gathering in wireless sensor networks. We consider the problem of optimally constructing forwarding trees to carry compressed data to projection nodes. Each compressed dataset refers to a weighted aggregation (or sum) of sensed measurements from network sensors collected at one projection node. Projection nodes then forward their received compressed data to the sink, which subsequently recovers the original measurements. This aggregation technique, based on CS, is shown to reduce significantly the number of transmissions in the network. We observe that the presence of multiple forwarding trees gives rise to many-to-many communication patterns in sensor networks that, in turn, can be exploited to perform NC on the compressed data being forwarded on these trees. Such a technique will further reduce the number of transmissions required to gather the measurements, resulting in a better network-wide energy efficiency. This article addresses the problem of NC--aware construction of forwarding\/aggregation trees. We present a mathematical model to optimally construct such forwarding trees, which encourage NC operations on the compressed data. Owing to its complexity, we further develop algorithmic methods (both centralized and distributed) for solving the problem and analyze their complexities. We show that our algorithmic methods are scalable and accurate, with worst-case optimality gap not exceeding 3.96&percnt; in the studied scenarios. We also show that, when bothNC and compressive data gathering are considered jointly, performance gains (reduction in number of transmissions) of up to 30&percnt; may be attained. Finally, we show that the proposed methods distribute the workload of data gathering throughout the network nodes uniformly, resulting in extended network life times."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21593","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21593","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3069","fieldValue":"Kumari, B Venkata Seshu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3069","fieldValue":" We show that Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) supertags can improve Telugu dependency parsing. In this process, we first extract a CCG lexicon from the dependency treebank. Using both the CCG lexicon and the dependency treebank, we create a CCG treebank using a chart parser. Exploring different morphological features of Telugu, we develop a supertagger using maximum entropy models. We provide CCG supertags as features to the Telugu dependency parser (MST parser). We get an improvement of 1.8&percnt; in the unlabelled attachment score and 2.2&percnt; in the labelled attachment score.
