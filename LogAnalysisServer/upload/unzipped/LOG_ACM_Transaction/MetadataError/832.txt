{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13430","fieldValue":" The FPGA replay attack, where an attacker downgrades an FPGA-based system to the previous version with known vulnerabilities, has become a serious security and privacy concern for FPGA design. Current FPGA intellectual property (IP) protection mechanisms target the protection of FPGA configuration bitstreams by watermarking or encryption or binding. However, these mechanisms fail to prevent replay attacks. In this article, based on a recently reported PUF-FSM binding method that protects the usage of configuration bitstreams, we propose to reconfigure both the physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and the locking scheme of the finite state machine (FSM) in order to defeat the replay attack. We analyze the proposed scheme and demonstrate how replay attack would fail in attacking systems protected by the reconfigurable binding method. We implement two ways to build reconfigurable PUFs and propose two practical methods to reconfigure the locking scheme. Experimental results show that the two reconfigurable PUFs can generate significantly distinct responses with average reconfigurability of more than 40&percnt;. The reconfigurable locking schemes only incur a timing overhead less than 1&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13430","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13430","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13431","fieldValue":" We propose a system-level solution in designing process variation aware (PVA) scalable-throughput many-core systems for energy constrained applications. In our proposed methodology, we leverage the benefits of voltage scaling for obtaining energy efficiency while compensating for the loss in throughput by exploiting parallelism present in various DSP designs. We demonstrate that such a hybrid method consumes 6.27&percnt;- 28.15&percnt; less power as compared to simple dynamic voltage scaling over different workload environments. Design details of a prototype chip fabricated on 90nm technology node and its findings are presented. Chip consists of 8 homogeneous FIR cores, which are capable of running from near-threshold to nominal voltages. In our 20 chip population, we observe 7&percnt; variation in speed among the cores at nominal voltage (0.9V) and 26&percnt; at near threshold voltage (0.55V). We also observe 54&percnt; variation in power consumption of the cores. For any desired throughput, the optimum number of cores and their optimum operating voltage is chosen based on the speed and power characteristics of the cores present inside the chip. We will also present analysis on energy-efficiency of such systems based on changes in ambient temperature."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13431","fieldValue":"DSP"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13431","fieldValue":"DVFS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13431","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13431","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13432","fieldValue":" Real-time applications such as multimedia and gaming require stringent performance guarantees, usually enforced by a tight upper bound on the maximum end-to-end delay. For FIFO multiplexed on-chip packet switched networks we consider worst-case delay bounds for Variable Bit-Rate (VBR) flows with aggregate scheduling, which schedules multiple flows as an aggregate flow. VBR Flows are characterized by a maximum transfer size (L), peak rate (p), burstiness (Ïƒ), and average sustainable rate (Ï?). Based on network calculus, we present and prove theorems to derive per-flow end-to-end Equivalent Service Curves (ESC), which are in turn used for computing Least Upper Delay Bounds (LUDBs) of individual flows. In a realistic case study we find that the end-to-end delay bound is up to 46.9&percnt; more accurate than the case without considering the traffic peak behavior. Likewise, results also show similar improvements for synthetic traffic patterns. The proposed methodology is implemented in C++ and has low run-time complexity, enabling quick evaluation for large and complex SoCs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13432","fieldValue":"ACM"}
