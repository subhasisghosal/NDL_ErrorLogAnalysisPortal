User requests are stochastic based on some movie popularity distribution. The problem is how to replicate (or place) content at peer storage to minimize the server load. Several variations of this replication problem have been studied recently with somewhat different conclusions. In this paper, we first point out and explain that the main difference between these studies is in how they model the scheduling of peers to serve user requests, and show that these different scheduling assumptions will lead to different \"optimal\" replication strategies. We then propose a unifying request scheduling model, parameterized by the maximum number of peers that can be used to serve a single request. This scheduling is called Fair Sharing with Bounded Degree (FSBD). Based on this unifying model, we can compare the different replication strategies for different degree bounds and see how and why different replication strategies are favored depending on the degree. We also propose a simple (primarily) distributed replication algorithm and show that this algorithm is able to adapt itself to work well for different degrees in scheduling."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10783","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10783","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10783","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10784","fieldValue":" We formulate and study the thinnest path problem for secure communication in wireless ad hoc networks. The objective is to find a path from a source to its destination that results in the minimum number of nodes overhearing the message by a judicious choice of relaying nodes and their corresponding transmission powers. We adopt a directed hypergraph model of the problem and establish the NP-completeness of the problem in 2-D networks. We then develop two polynomial-time approximation algorithms that offer [EQUATION] and [EQUATION] approximation ratios for general directed hypergraphs (which can model nonisotropic signal propagation in space) and constant approximation ratios for ring hypergraphs (which result from isotropic signal propagation). We also consider the thinnest path problem in 1-D networks and 1-D networks embedded in a 2-D field of eavesdroppers with arbitrary unknown locations (the so-called 1.5-D networks). We propose a linear-complexity algorithm based on nested backward induction that obtains the optimal solution for both 1-D and 1.5-D networks. This algorithm does not require the knowledge of eavesdropper locations and achieves the best performance offered by any algorithm that assumes complete location information of the eavesdroppers."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10784","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10784","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10784","fieldValue":"ACM"}
