To mitigate the performance degradation resulting from small buffers, this paper proposes that optical edge nodes \"pace\" the injection of traffic into the OPS core. Our contributions relating to pacing in OPS networks are three-fold: first, we develop real-time pacing algorithms of poly-logarithmic complexity that are feasible for practical implementation in emerging high-speed OPS networks. Second, we provide an analytical quantification of the benefits of pacing in reducing traffic burstiness and traffic loss at a link with very small buffers. Third, we show via simulations of realistic network topologies that pacing can significantly reduce network losses at the expense of a small and bounded increase in end-to-end delay for real-time traffic flows. We argue that the loss-delay tradeoff mechanism provided by pacing can be instrumental in overcoming the performance hurdle arising from the scarcity of buffers in OPS networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9891","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9891","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9891","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9892","fieldValue":" In this paper, we consider the problem of fault localization in all-optical networks. We introduce the concept of monitoring cycles (MCs) and monitoring paths (MPs) for unique identification of single-link failures. MCs and MPs are required to pass through one or more monitoring locations. They are constructed such that any single-link failure results in the failure of a unique combination of MCs and MPs that pass through the monitoring location(s). For a network with only one monitoring location, we prove that three-edge connectivity is a necessary and sufficient condition for constructing MCs that uniquely identify any single-link failure in the network. For this case, we formulate the problem of constructing MCs as an integer linear program (ILP). We also develop heuristic approaches for constructing MCs in the presence of one or more monitoring locations. For an arbitrary network (not necessarily three-edge connected), we describe a fault localization technique that uses both MPs and MCs and that employs multiple monitoring locations. We also provide a linear-time algorithm to compute the minimum number of required monitoring locations. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed monitoring technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9892","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9892","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9892","fieldValue":"ACM"}
