To computationally annotate proteins, it is necessary and promising to integrate these heterogeneous data sources. Some methods transform these data sources into different kernels or feature representations. Next, these kernels are linearly (or non-linearly) combined into a composite kernel. The composite kernel is utilized to develop a predictive model to infer the function of proteins. A protein can have multiple roles and functions (or labels). Therefore, multi-label learning methods are also adapted for protein function prediction. We develop a transductive multi-label classifier (TMC) to predict multiple functions of proteins using several unlabeled proteins. We also propose a method called transductive multi-label ensemble classifier (TMEC) for integrating the different data sources using an ensemble approach. TMEC trains a graph-based multi-label classifier on each single data source and then combines the predictions of the individual classifiers. We use a directed bi-relational graph to captures three types of relationships between pairs of proteins, between pairs of functions, and between proteins and functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of TMC and TMEC to predict the functions of proteins on three benchmarks. We show that our approaches perform better than recently proposed protein function prediction methods on composite and multiple kernels."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4988","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4988","fieldValue":"Proteins,Kernel,Correlation,Bioinformatics,Vectors,IEEE transactions,Computational biology,Mining methods and algorithms,Data mining,Clustering,classification,and association rules,Bioinformatics (genome or protein) databases,Knowledge management applications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4988","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4988","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4989","fieldValue":"de Miguel Casado, Gregorio"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4989","fieldValue":" The need for general-purpose algorithms for studying biological properties in phylogenetics motivates research into formal verification frameworks. Researchers can focus their efforts exclusively on evolution trees and property specifications. To this end, model checking, a mature automated verification technique originating in computer science, is applied to phylogenetic analysis. Our approach is based on three cornerstones: a logical modeling of the evolution with transition systems; the specification of both phylogenetic properties and trees using flexible temporal logic formulas; and the verification of the latter by means of automated computer tools. The most conspicuous result is the inception of a formal framework which allows for a symbolic manipulation of biological data (based on the codification of the taxa). Additionally, different logical models of evolution can be considered, complex properties can be specified in terms of the logical composition of others, and the refinement of unfulfilled properties as well as the discovery of new properties can be undertaken by exploiting the verification results. Some experimental results using a symbolic model verifier support the feasibility of the approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4989","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4989","fieldValue":"ACM"}
