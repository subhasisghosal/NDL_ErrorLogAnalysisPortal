We consider the problem of assigning short labels to the nodes of any n-node graph is such a way that given the labels of any two nodes u and v, one can decide whether u and v are k-vertex connected in G, that is, whether there exist k vertex disjoint paths connecting u and v. This article establishes an upper bound of $k^2log n on the number of bits used in a label. The best previous upper bound for the label size of such a labeling scheme is 2k$log n."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2430","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2430","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15121","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15121","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15122","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15122","fieldValue":"ACM"}
