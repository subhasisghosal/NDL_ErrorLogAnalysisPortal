The camera is passive, supporting both stills and video, low light capable, and small enough to be included in the next generation of mobile devices including smartphones. Prior works [Rander et al. 1997; Yang et al. 2002; Zhang and Chen 2004; Tanida et al. 2001; Tanida et al. 2003; Duparr√© et al. 2004] in camera arrays have explored multiple facets of light field capture - from viewpoint synthesis, synthetic refocus, computing range images, high speed video, and micro-optical aspects of system miniaturization. However, none of these have addressed the modifications needed to achieve the strict form factor and image quality required to make array cameras practical for mobile devices. In our approach, we customize many aspects of the camera array including lenses, pixels, sensors, and software algorithms to achieve imaging performance and form factor comparable to existing mobile phone cameras. Our contributions to the post-processing of images from camera arrays include a cost function for parallax detection that integrates across multiple color channels, and a regularized image restoration (superresolution) process that takes into account all the system degradations and adapts to a range of practical imaging conditions. The registration uncertainty from the parallax detection process is integrated into a Maximum-a-Posteriori formulation that synthesizes an estimate of the high resolution image and scene depth. We conclude with some examples of our array capabilities such as postcapture (still) refocus, video refocus, view synthesis to demonstrate motion parallax, 3D range images, and briefly address future work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16947","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16947","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16948","fieldValue":" Time of flight cameras produce real-time range maps at a relatively low cost using continuous wave amplitude modulation and demodulation. However, they are geared to measure range (or phase) for a single reflected bounce of light and suffer from systematic errors due to multipath interference. We re-purpose the conventional time of flight device for a new goal: to recover per-pixel sparse time profiles expressed as a sequence of impulses. With this modification, we show that we can not only address multipath interference but also enable new applications such as recovering depth of near-transparent surfaces, looking through diffusers and creating time-profile movies of sweeping light. Our key idea is to formulate the forward amplitude modulated light propagation as a convolution with custom codes, record samples by introducing a simple sequence of electronic time delays, and perform sparse deconvolution to recover sequences of Diracs that correspond to multipath returns. Applications to computer vision include ranging of near-transparent objects and subsurface imaging through diffusers. Our low cost prototype may lead to new insights regarding forward and inverse problems in light transport."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16948","fieldValue":"Coded time of flight cameras: sparse deconvolution to address multipath interference and recover time profiles"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16948","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16948","fieldValue":"ACM"}
