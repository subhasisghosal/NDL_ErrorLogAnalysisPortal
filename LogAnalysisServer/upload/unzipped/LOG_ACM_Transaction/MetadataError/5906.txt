{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5681","fieldValue":" When directly manipulating 3D objects in an immersive environment we cannot normally achieve the accuracy and control that we have in the real world. This reduced accuracy stems from hand instability. We present PRISM, which dynamically adjusts the C\/D ratio between the hand and the controlled object to provide increased control when moving slowly and direct, unconstrained interaction when moving rapidly. We describe PRISM object translation and rotation and present user studies demonstrating their effectiveness. In addition, we describe a PRISM-enhanced version of ray casting which is shown to increase the speed and accuracy of object selection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5681","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5681","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5682","fieldValue":"McGrenere, Joanna"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5682","fieldValue":" Two approaches for supporting personalization in complex software are system-controlled adaptive menus and user-controlled adaptable menus. We evaluate a novel interface design for feature-rich productivity software based on adaptable menus. The design allows the user to easily customize a personalized interface, and also supports quick access to the default interface with all of the standard features. This design was prototyped as a front-end to a commercial word processor. A field experiment investigated users' personalizing behavior and tested the effects of different interface designs on users' satisfaction and their perceived ability to navigate, control, and learn the software. There were two conditions: a commercial word processor with adaptive menus and our prototype with adaptable menus for the same word processor. Our evaluation shows: (1) when provided with a flexible, easy-to-use and easy-to-understand customization mechanism, the majority of users do effectively personalize their interface; and (2) user-controlled interface adaptation with our adaptable menus results in better navigation and learnability, and allows for the adoption of different personalization strategies, as compared to a particular system-controlled adaptive menu system that implements a single strategy. We report qualitative data obtained from interviews and questionnaires with participants in the evaluation in addition to quantitative data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5682","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5682","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5683","fieldValue":"Van Schaik, Paul"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5683","fieldValue":" The effects of design parameters of rating scales on the perceived quality of interaction with web sites were investigated, using four scales (Disorientation, Perceived ease of use, Perceived usefulness and Flow). Overall, the scales exhibited good psychometric properties. In Experiment 1, psychometric results generally converged between two response formats (visual analogue scale and Likert scale). However, in Experiment 2, presentation of one questionnaire item per page was better than all items presented on a single page and direct interaction (using radio buttons) was better than indirect interaction (using a drop-down box). Practical implications and a framework for measurement are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5683","fieldValue":"ACM"}
