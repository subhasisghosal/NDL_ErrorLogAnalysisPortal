In this context, packet-level simulations, which are widely used to study network protocols, are too costly given the typical large scales of simulated systems and applications. An alternative is to implement network simulations with less costly flow-level models. Several flow-level models have been proposed and implemented in grid\/cloud simulators. Surprisingly, published validations of these models, if any, consist of verifications for only a few simple cases. Consequently, even when they have been used to obtain published results, the ability of these simulators to produce scientifically meaningful results is in doubt. This work evaluates these state-of-the-art flow-level network models of TCP communication via comparison to packet-level simulation. While it is straightforward to show cases in which previously proposed models lead to good results, instead we follow the critical method, which places model refutation at the center of the scientific activity, and we systematically seek cases that lead to invalid results. Careful analysis of these cases reveals fundamental flaws and also suggests improvements. One contribution of this work is that these improvements lead to a new model that, while far from being perfect, improves upon all previously proposed models in the context of simulation of grids or clouds. A more important contribution, perhaps, is provided by the pitfalls and unexpected behaviors encountered in this work, leading to a number of enlightening lessons. In particular, this work shows that model validation cannot be achieved solely by exhibiting (possibly many) â\u20ACœgood cases.â\u20AC? Confidence in the quality of a model can only be strengthened through an invalidation approach that attempts to prove the model wrong."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25084","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25084","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25085","fieldValue":"Choi, Byoung K"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25085","fieldValue":"Jamjoom, Arwa A"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25085","fieldValue":"Abulkhair, Maysoon F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25085","fieldValue":" The classical activity cycle diagram (ACD), which is a bipartite directed graph, is easy to learn and use for describing the dynamic behavior of a discrete-event system. However, the complexity of the classical ACD model increases rapidly as the system size increases. This article presents an enriched ACD called the parameterized ACD (P-ACD). In P-ACD, each node is allowed to have parameter variables, and parameter values are passed to the parameter variables through a directed arc. This article demonstrates how a single P-ACD model can be used to represent an entire class of very large-scale systems instead of requiring different ACD models for every instance. We also illustrate that the well-known activity scanning algorithm can be used to execute a P-ACD model. A prototype P-ACD simulator implemented in C&num; programming language is provided, and an illustrative example of a conveyor-driven serial production line with the prototype simulator is presented to illustrate construction and execution of a P-ACD model. In addition, it is demonstrated that the proposed P-ACD allows an effective and concise modeling of a job shop, which was not possible with the classical ACD."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25085","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25085","fieldValue":"ACM"}
