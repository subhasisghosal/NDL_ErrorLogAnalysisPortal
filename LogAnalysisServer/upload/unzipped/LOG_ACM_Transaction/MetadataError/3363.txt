We present ZBD, a block-layer driver that transparently compresses and decompresses data as they flow between the file-system and storage devices. Our system provides support for variable-size blocks, metadata caching, and persistence, as well as block allocation and cleanup. ZBD targets maintaining high performance, by mitigating compression and decompression overheads that can have a significant impact on performance by leveraging modern multicore CPUs through explicit work scheduling. We present two case-studies for compression. First, we examine how our approach can be used to increase the capacity of SSD-based caches, thus increasing their cost-effectiveness. Then, we examine how ZBD can improve the efficiency of online disk-based storage systems. We evaluate our approach in the Linux kernel on a commodity server with multicore CPUs, using PostMark, SPECsfs2008, TPC-C, and TPC-H. Preliminary results show that transparent online block-level compression is a viable option for improving effective storage capacity, it can improve I\/O performance up to 80&percnt; by reducing I\/O traffic and seek distance, and has a negative impact on performance, up to 34&percnt;, only when single-thread I\/O latency is critical. In particular, for SSD-based caching, our results indicate that, in line with current technology trends, compressed caching trades off CPU utilization for performance and enhances SSD efficiency as a storage cache up to 99&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21022","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21022","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21023","fieldValue":"Adams, Ian F"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21023","fieldValue":"Storer, Mark W"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21023","fieldValue":"Miller, Ethan L"}
