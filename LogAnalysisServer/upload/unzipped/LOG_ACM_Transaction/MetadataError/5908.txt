They can be used for many purposes, from teleconferencing to training people to perform assembly tasks. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of CVEs is compromised by one major problem: the delay that exists in the networks linking users together. Whilst we have a good understanding, especially in the visual modality, of how users are affected by delayed feedback from their own actions, little research has systematically examined how users are affected by delayed feedback from other people, particularly in environments that support haptic (force) feedback. The current study addresses this issue by quantifying how increasing levels of latency affect visual and haptic feedback in a collaborative target acquisition task. Our results demonstrate that haptic feedback in particular is very sensitive to low levels of delay. Whilst latency affects visual feedback from 50 ms, it impacts on haptic task performance 25 ms earlier, and causes the haptic measures of performance deterioration to rise far more steeply than visual. The â\u20ACœimpact-perceive-adaptâ\u20AC? model of user performance, which considers the interaction between performance measures, perception of latency, and the breakdown of perception of immediate causality, is proposed as an explanation for the observed pattern of performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5688","fieldValue":"Teo, Hock-Hai"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5688","fieldValue":" The technology acceptance model (TAM) is very widely used for studying technology acceptance. The model states that an individual's behavioral intention (BI) to use an information system is determined by his perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of it. While many studies have applied the TAM, none has examined the model's behavior over its entire value range. We conducted two surveys to examine the values of BI over the two-dimensional boundary space formed by PU and PEOU. Contrary to current understanding, we find that the effects of PU and PEOU vary over the boundary space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5688","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5688","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5689","fieldValue":" Visually impaired users are hindered in their efforts to access the largest repository of electronic information in the world, namely, the World Wide Web (web). A visually impaired user's information and presentation requirements are different from a sighted user's. These requirements can become problems in that the web is visually centric with regard to presentation and information order\/layout. Finding semantic information already encoded directly into documents can help to alleviate these problems. Our approach can be loosely described as follows. For a particular cascading stylesheet (CSS), we provide an extension to an upper-level ontology which represents the interface between web documents and the programmatic transformation mechanism. This extension gives the particular characteristics of the elements appearing in that specific CSS. We can consider this extension to be an annotation of the CSS elements implicitly encoded into the web document. This means that one ontology can be used to accuratly transform every web document that references the CSS used to generate that ontology. Simply one ontology accuratly transforms an entire site using a generalized programmatic machinery able to cope with all sites using CSS. Here we describe our method, implementation, and technical evaluation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5689","fieldValue":"ACM"}
