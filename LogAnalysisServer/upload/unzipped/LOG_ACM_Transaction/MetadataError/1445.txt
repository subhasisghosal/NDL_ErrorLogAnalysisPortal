{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15426","fieldValue":" High-quality Monte Carlo image synthesis requires the ability to importance sample realistic BRDF models. However, analytic sampling algorithms exist only for the Phong model and its derivatives such as Lafortune and Blinn-Phong. This paper demonstrates an importance sampling technique for a wide range of BRDFs, including complex analytic models such as Cook-Torrance and measured materials, which are being increasingly used for realistic image synthesis. Our approach is based on a compact factored representation of the BRDF that is optimized for sampling. We show that our algorithm consistently offers better efficiency than alternatives that involve fitting and sampling a Lafortune or Blinn-Phong lobe, and is more compact than sampling strategies based on tabulating the full BRDF. We are able to efficiently create images involving multiple measured and analytic BRDFs, under both complex direct lighting and global illumination."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15426","fieldValue":"BRDF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15426","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15426","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2462","fieldValue":"Har-Peled, Sariel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2462","fieldValue":" We study the shape matching problem under the Hausdorff distance and its variants. In the first part of the article, we consider two sets A,B of balls in $R^d, d&equals;2,3, and wish to find a translation t that minimizes the Hausdorff distance between A+t, the set of all balls in A shifted by t, and B. We consider several variants of this problem. First, we extend the notion of Hausdorff distance from sets of points to sets of balls, so that each ball has to be matched with the nearest ball in the other set. We also consider the problem in the standard setting, by computing the Hausdorff distance between the unions of the two sets (as point sets). Second, we consider either all possible translations t (as is the standard approach), or consider only translations that keep the balls of A+t disjoint from those of B. We propose several exact and approximation algorithms for these problems. In the second part of the article, we note that the Hausdorff distance is sensitive to outliers, and thus consider two variants that are more robust: the root-mean-square (rms) and the summed Hausdorff distance. We propose efficient approximation algorithms for computing the minimum rms and the minimum summed Hausdorff distances under translation, between two point sets in Rd. In order to obtain a fast algorithm for the summed Hausdorff distance, we propose a deterministic efficient dynamic data structure for maintaining an &epsis;-approximation of the 1-median of a set of points in Rd$, under insertions and deletions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2462","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2462","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15427","fieldValue":"DeCarlo, Doug"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15427","fieldValue":" We describe a method for using a database of recorded speech and captured motion to create an animated conversational character. People's utterances are composed of short, clearly-delimited phrases; in each phrase, gesture and speech go together meaningfully and synchronize at a common point of maximum emphasis. We develop tools for collecting and managing performance data that exploit this structure. The tools help create scripts for performers, help annotate and segment performance data, and structure specific messages for characters to use within application contexts. Our animations then reproduce this structure. They recombine motion samples with new speech samples to recreate coherent phrases, and blend segments of speech and motion together phrase-by-phrase into extended utterances. By framing problems for utterance generation and synthesis so that they can draw closely on a talented performance, our techniques support the rapid construction of animated characters with rich and appropriate expression."}
