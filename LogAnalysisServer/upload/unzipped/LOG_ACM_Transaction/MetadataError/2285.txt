The rigid shape matching problem can be formulated as the problem of simultaneously aligning and labelling two point clouds in 3D so that they are as similar as possible. We name this problem the Procrustes matching (PM) problem. The non-rigid shape matching problem can be formulated as a higher dimensional PM problem using the functional maps method. High dimensional PM problems are difficult non-convex problems which currently can only be solved locally using iterative closest point (ICP) algorithms or similar methods. Good initialization is crucial for obtaining a good solution. We introduce a novel and efficient convex SDP (semidefinite programming) relaxation for the PM problem. The algorithm is guaranteed to return a correct global solution of the problem when matching two isometric shapes which are either asymmetric or bilaterally symmetric. We show our algorithm gives state of the art results on popular shape matching datasets. We also show that our algorithm gives state of the art results for anatomical classification of shapes. Finally we demonstrate the power of our method in aligning shape collections."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17562","fieldValue":" This paper presents a method for bijective parametrization of 2D and 3D objects over canonical domains. While a range of solutions for the two-dimensional case are well-known, our method guarantees bijectivity of mappings also for a large, combinatorially-defined class of tetrahedral meshes (shellable meshes). The key concept in our method is the piecewise-linear (PL) foliation, decomposing the mesh into one-dimensional submanifolds and reducing the mapping problem to parametrization of a lower-dimensional manifold (a foliation section). The maps resulting from these foliations are proved to be bijective and continuous, and shown to have provably bijective PL approximations. We describe exact, numerically robust evaluation methods and demonstrate our implementation's capabilities on a large variety of meshes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2661","fieldValue":" Consider the following problem: given a set system (U, Î©) and an edge-weighted graph G &equals; (U, E) on the same universe U, find the set A âˆˆ Î© such that the Steiner tree cost with terminals A is as large as possibleâ\u20AC\u201Dâ\u20ACœwhich set in Î© is the most difficult to connect up?â\u20AC? This is an example of a max-min problem: find the set A âˆˆ Î© such that the value of some minimization (covering) problem is as large as possible. In this article, we show that for certain covering problems that admit good deterministic online algorithms, we can give good algorithms for max-min optimization when the set system Î© is given by a p-system or knapsack constraints or both. This result is similar to results for constrained maximization of submodular functions. Although many natural covering problems are not even approximately submodular, we show that one can use properties of the online algorithm as a surrogate for submodularity. Moreover, we give stronger connections between max-min optimization and two-stage robust optimization, and hence give improved algorithms for robust versions of various covering problems, for cases where the uncertainty sets are given by p-systems and knapsack constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2661","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2661","fieldValue":"ACM"}
