Although this processis best suited for an interactive environment, ELLPACK itself is batch oriented. With this in mind,we have developed Interactive ELLPACK, an extension of ELLPACK that provides true interactiveelliptic problem solving by allowing the user to interactively build grids, choose solution methods,and analyze computed results. Interactive ELLPACK features a sophisticated interface with window-ing, color graphics output, and graphics input."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18547","fieldValue":"Interactive ELLPACK: an interactive problem-solving environment for elliptic partial differential equations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18548","fieldValue":" A method is presented for the generation of test problems for global optimization algorithms.

This article considers breadth-first search (BFS) spanning trees and addresses the problem of designing a sparse fault-tolerant BFS structure (FT-BFS structure), namely, a sparse subgraph T of the given network G such that subsequent to the failure of a single edge or vertex, the surviving part Tâ\u20AC² of T still contains a BFS spanning tree for (the surviving part of) G. For a source node s, a target node t, and an edge e âˆˆ G, the shortest s âˆ\u2019 t path $P_s, t, e that does not go through e is known as a replacement path. Thus, our FT-BFS structure contains the collection of all replacement paths Ps, t, e for every t âˆˆ V(G) and every failed edge e âˆˆ E(G). Our main results are as follows. We present an algorithm that for every n-vertex graph G and source node s constructs a (single edge failure) FT-BFS structure rooted at s with O(n Ä\u2039 min {Depth(s), &sqrt;n{) edges, where Depth(s) is the depth of the BFS tree rooted at s. This result is complemented by a matching lower bound, showing that there exist n-vertex graphs with a source node s for which any edge (or vertex) FT-BFS structure rooted at s has $Î©(n^3\/2) edges. We then consider fault-tolerant multi-source BFS structures (FT-MBFS structures), aiming to provide (following a failure) a BFS tree rooted at each source s âˆˆ S for some subset of sources SâŠ\u2020V. Again, tight bounds are provided, showing that there exists a poly-time algorithm that for every n-vertex graph and source set SâŠ\u2020V of size Ïƒ constructs a (single failure) FT-MBFS structure T*(S) from each source si$ âˆˆ S, with O(&sqrt;Ïƒ Ä\u2039 n3\/2) edges, and, on the other hand, there exist n-vertex graphs with source sets SâŠ\u2020V of cardinality Ïƒ, on which any FT-MBFS structure from S has Î©(&sqrt;Ïƒ Ä\u2039 n3\/2$) edges. Finally, we propose an O(logâ\u20AC\u2030n) approximation algorithm for constructing FT-BFS and FT-MBFS structures. The latter is complemented by a hardness result stating that there exists no Î©(logâ\u20AC\u2030n) approximation algorithm for these problems under standard complexity assumptions. In comparison with previous constructions, our algorithm is deterministic and may improve the number of edges by a factor of up to &sqrt;n for some instances. All our algorithms can be extended to deal with one vertex failure as well, with the same performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2742","fieldValue":"ACM"}
