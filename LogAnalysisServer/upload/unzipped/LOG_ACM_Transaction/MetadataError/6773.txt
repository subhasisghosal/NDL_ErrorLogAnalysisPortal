This article proposes a new spatial query, Spatio-Social Team Query (SSTQ), that forms a strong task group by considering (1) the groupâ\u20AC™s spatial distance (i.e., transportation time), (2) skills of the candidate group members, and (3) social rapport among the candidates. Efficient processing of SSTQ is very challenging, because the aforementioned spatial, skill, and social factors need to be carefully examined. In this article, therefore, we first formulate two subproblems of SSTQ, namely Hop-Constrained Team Problem (HCTP) and Connection-Oriented Team Query (COTQ). HCTP is a decision problem that considers only social and skill dimensions. We prove that HCTP is NP-Complete. Moreover, based on the hardness of HCTP, we prove that SSTQ is NP-Hard and inapproximable within any factor. On the other hand, COTQ is a special case of SSTQ that relaxes the social constraint. We prove that COTQ is NP-Hard and propose an approximation algorithm for COTQ, namely COTprox. Furthermore, based on the observations on COTprox, we devise an approximation algorithm, SSTprox, with a guaranteed error bound for SSTQ. Finally, to efficiently obtain the optimal solution to SSTQ for small instances, we design two efficient algorithms, SpatialFirst and SkillFirst, with different scenarios in mind. These two algorithms incorporate various effective ordering and pruning techniques to reduce the search space for answering SSTQ. Experimental results on real datasets indicate that the proposed algorithms can efficiently answer SSTQ under various parameter settings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8066","fieldValue":" Micro-blog has been increasingly used for the public to express their opinions, and for organizations to detect public sentiment about social events or public policies. In this article, we examine and identify the key problems of this field, focusing particularly on the characteristics of innovative words, multi-media elements, and hierarchical structure of Chinese â\u20ACœWeibo.â\u20AC? Based on the analysis, we propose a novel approach and develop associated theoretical and technological methods to address these problems. These include a new sentiment word mining method based on three wording metrics and point-wise information, a rule set model for analyzing sentiment features of different linguistic components, and the corresponding methodology for calculating sentiment on multi-granularity considering emoticon elements as auxiliary affective factors. We evaluate our new word discovery and sentiment detection methods on a real-life Chinese micro-blog dataset. Initial results show that our new diction can improve sentiment detection, and they demonstrate that our multi-level rule set method is more effective, with the average accuracy being 10.2&percnt; and 1.5&percnt; higher than two existing methods for Chinese micro-blog sentiment analysis. In addition, we exploit visualization techniques to study the relationships between online sentiment and real life. The visualization of detected sentiment can help depict temporal patterns and spatial discrepancy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8067","fieldValue":"Eliassi-Rad, Tina"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8067","fieldValue":" Large graphs are prevalent in many applications and enable a variety of information dissemination processes, e.g., meme, virus, and influence propagation. How can we optimize the underlying graph structure to affect the outcome of such dissemination processes in a desired way (e.g., stop a virus propagation, facilitate the propagation of a piece of good idea, etc)? Existing research suggests that the leading eigenvalue of the underlying graph is the key metric in determining the so-called epidemic threshold for a variety of dissemination models. In this paper, we study the problem of how to optimally place a set of edges (e.g., edge deletion and edge addition) to optimize the leading eigenvalue of the underlying graph, so that we can guide the dissemination process in a desired way. We propose effective, scalable algorithms for edge deletion and edge addition, respectively. In addition, we reveal the intrinsic relationship between edge deletion and node deletion problems. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. "}
