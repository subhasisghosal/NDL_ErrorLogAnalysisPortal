In comparative genomics, differences or similarities of gene orders are determined to predict functional relations of genes or phylogenetic relations of genomes. For this purpose, various combinatorial models can be used to identify gene clustersâ\u20AC\u201Dgroups of genes that are colocated in a set of genomes. We introduce a unified approach to model gene clusters and define the problem of labeling the inner nodes of a given phylogenetic tree with sets of gene clusters. Our optimization criterion in this context combines two properties: parsimony, i.e., the number of gains and losses of gene clusters has to be minimal, and consistency, i.e., for each ancestral node, there must exist at least one potential gene order that contains all the reconstructed clusters. We present and evaluate an exact algorithm to solve this problem. Despite its exponential worst-case time complexity, our method is suitable even for large-scale data. We show the effectiveness and efficiency on both simulated and real data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4432","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4432","fieldValue":"Comparative genomics, gene order, gene cluster, gene cluster reconstruction, phylogeny, parsimony, consistency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4432","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4432","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4433","fieldValue":" In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in inferring the total order of genes or markers on a chromosome, since current genetic mapping efforts might only suffice to produce a partial order. Many interesting optimization problems were thus formulated in the framework of genome rearrangement. As an important one among them, the minimum breakpoint linearization (MBL) problem is to find the total order of a partially ordered genome that minimizes its breakpoint distance to a reference genome whose genes are already totally ordered. It was previously shown to be NP-hard, and the algorithms proposed so far are all heuristic. In this paper, we present an {m^2+m\\over 2}-approximation algorithm for the MBL problem, where m is the number of gene maps that are combined together to form a partial order of the genome under investigation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4433","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4433","fieldValue":"ACM"}
