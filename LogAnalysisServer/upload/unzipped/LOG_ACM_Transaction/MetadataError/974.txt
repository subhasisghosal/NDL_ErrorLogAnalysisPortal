These properties include fast retrieval time, quick unsuccessful search determination, and finding the longest match to a given identifier. The main drawback is the space requirement. In this paper the concept of trie compaction is formalized. An exact algorithm for optimal trie compaction and three algorithms for approximate trie compaction are given, and an analysis of the three algorithms is done. The analysis indicate that for actual tries, reductions of around 70 percent in the space required by the uncompacted trie can be expected. The quality of the compaction is shown to be insensitive to the number of nodes, while a more relevant parameter is the alphabet size of the key."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13988","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13988","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13989","fieldValue":" Recent work considers a database state to satisfy a set of dependencies if there exists a satisfying universal relation whose projections contain each of the relations in the state. Such relations are called weak instances for the state. We propose the set of all weak instances for a state as an embodiment of the information represented by the state. We characterize states that have the same set of weak instances by the equivalence of their associated tableaux. We apply this notion to the comparison of database schemes and characterize all pairs of schemes such that for every legal state of one of them there exists an equivalent legal state of the other one. We use this approach to provide a new characterization of Boyce-Codd Normal Form relation schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13989","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13989","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2321","fieldValue":"Lu, Hsueh-I"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2321","fieldValue":"Yeh, Chia-Chi"}
