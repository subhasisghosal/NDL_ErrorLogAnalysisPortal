The new algorithm is primarily based on the ILUTP approach by Saad, and we incorporate a number of techniques to improve the robustness and performance of the traditional ILUTP method. These include new dropping strategies that accommodate the use of supernodal structures in the factored matrix and an area-based fill control heuristic for the secondary dropping strategy. We present numerical experiments to demonstrate that our new method is competitive with the other ILU approaches and is well suited for modern architectures with memory hierarchy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19300","fieldValue":"Le Digabel, Sbastien"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19300","fieldValue":" NOMAD is software that implements the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm for blackbox optimization under general nonlinear constraints. Blackbox optimization is about optimizing functions that are usually given as costly programs with no derivative information and no function values returned for a significant number of calls attempted. NOMAD is designed for such problems and aims for the best possible solution with a small number of evaluations. The objective of this article is to describe the underlying algorithm, the softwareâ\u20AC™s functionalities, and its implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19300","fieldValue":"ACM"}
