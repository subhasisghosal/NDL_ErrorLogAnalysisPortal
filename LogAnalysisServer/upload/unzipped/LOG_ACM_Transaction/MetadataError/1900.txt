We first report on an implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm for computing the treewidth of a graph with running time $O&ast;(2^n). This algorithm is based on the old dynamic programming method introduced by Held and Karp for the Traveling Salesman problem. We use some optimizations that do not affect the worst case running time but improve on the running time on actual instances and can be seen to be practical for small instances. We also consider the problem of computing Treewidth under the restriction that the space used is only polynomial and give a simple O&ast;(4n) algorithm that requires polynomial space. We also show that with a more complicated algorithm using balanced separators, Treewidth can be computed in O&ast;(2.9512n$) time and polynomial space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2573","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2573","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16589","fieldValue":" This article presents an algorithm for learning hatching styles from line drawings. An artist draws a single hatching illustration of a 3D object. Her strokes are analyzed to extract the following per-pixel properties: hatching level (hatching, cross-hatching, or no strokes), stroke orientation, spacing, intensity, length, and thickness. A mapping is learned from input geometric, contextual, and shading features of the 3D object to these hatching properties, using classification, regression, and clustering techniques. Then, a new illustration can be generated in the artist's style, as follows. First, given a new view of a 3D object, the learned mapping is applied to synthesize target stroke properties for each pixel. A new illustration is then generated by synthesizing hatching strokes according to the target properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16589","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16589","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16590","fieldValue":" We present a novel shape completion technique for creating temporally coherent watertight surfaces from real-time captured dynamic performances. Because of occlusions and low surface albedo, scanned mesh sequences typically exhibit large holes that persist over extended periods of time. Most conventional dynamic shape reconstruction techniques rely on template models or assume slow deformations in the input data. Our framework sidesteps these requirements and directly initializes shape completion with topology derived from the visual hull. To seal the holes with patches that are consistent with the subject's motion, we first minimize surface bending energies in each frame to ensure smooth transitions across hole boundaries. Temporally coherent dynamics of surface patches are obtained by unwarping all frames within a time window using accurate interframe correspondences. Aggregated surface samples are then filtered with a temporal visibility kernel that maximizes the use of nonoccluded surfaces. A key benefit of our shape completion strategy is that it does not rely on long-range correspondences or a template model. Consequently, our method does not suffer error accumulation typically introduced by noise, large deformations, and drastic topological changes. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on several high-resolution scans of human performances captured with a state-of-the-art multiview 3D acquisition system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16590","fieldValue":"ACM"}
