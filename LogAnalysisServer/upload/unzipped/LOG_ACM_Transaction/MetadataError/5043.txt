{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3772","fieldValue":" Learning languages in addition to the native language is very important for all people in the globalized world today, and computer-aided pronunciation training (CAPT) is attractive since the software can be used anywhere at any time, and repeated as many times as desired. In this paper, we introduce the immersive interaction scenario offered by spoken dialogues to CAPT by proposing a recursive dialogue game to make CAPT personalized. A number of tree-structured sub-dialogues are linked sequentially and recursively as the script for the game. The system policy at each dialogue turn is to select in real-time along the dialogue the best training sentence for each specific individual learner within the dialogue script, considering the learner's learning status and the future possible dialogue paths in the script, such that the learner can have the scores for all pronunciation units considered reaching a predefined standard in a minimum number of turns. The purpose here is that those pronunciation units poorly produced by the specific learner can be offered with more practice opportunities in the future sentences along the dialogue, which enables the learner to improve the pronunciation without having to repeat the same training sentences many times. This makes the learning process for each learner completely personalized. The dialogue policy is modeled by Markov decision process (MDP) with high-dimensional continuous state space, and trained with fitted value iteration using a huge number of simulated learners. These simulated leaners have the behavior similar to real learners, and were generated from a corpus of real learner data. The experiments demonstrated very promising results and a real cloud-based system is also successfully implemented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3773","fieldValue":" This abstract presents our entry to the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes challenge. The approach we propose for classifying acoustic scenes is based on transforming the audio signal into a time-frequency representation and then in extracting relevant features about shapes and evolutions of time-frequency structures. These features are based on histogram of gradients that are subsequently fed to amulti-class linear support vector machines."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3773","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3773","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3774","fieldValue":"Panahi, Issa M S"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3774","fieldValue":"Hansen, John H L"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3774","fieldValue":" With the ongoing miniaturization in the hearing aid industry, acoustical coupling between the loudspeaker and the microphone(s) of the hearing aid causes a major problem to users. Howling is one of the most severe and annoying consequences of this acoustical coupling. This study presents a howling detection method using the Generalized Teager-Kaiser Operator (GTKO). Since the GTKO is both time and frequency sensitive, its resolution parameter must be assigned properly to ensure satisfactory performance of this operator in the frequency range of the input signal for the hearing aid. In order to cover the entire band of the input signal with appropriate resolution parameters, the input signal is decomposed into a filterbank (i.e., uniform and nonuniform filterbanks). GTKO is applied to the output of each band to detect the howling, and the resolution parameter of the GTKO block is selected depending on the central frequency of that particular band. Experimental results compare the performance of each proposed method with two known howling detection approaches, Peak-to-harmonic power ratio (PHPR) approach and a multiple-feature approach. The proposed method has high detection probability and short detection time. It is also shown that considering a hybrid algorithm which includes the PHPR approach with each of the proposed methods (i.e. combination of GTKO blocks with different types of filterbanks) results in lower false alarm probability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3774","fieldValue":"ACM"}
