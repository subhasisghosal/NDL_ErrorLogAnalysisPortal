They incorporate user feedback to personalize the user experience typically via personalized recommendation lists. As users interact with a system, an increasing amount of data about a userâ\u20AC™s preferences becomes available, which can be leveraged for improving the systemsâ\u20AC™ performance. Incorporating these new data into the underlying recommendation model is, however, not always straightforward. Many models used by recommender systems are computationally expensive and, therefore, have to perform offline computations to compile the recommendation lists. For interactive applications, it is desirable to be able to update the computed values as soon as new user interaction data is available: updating recommendations in interactive time using new feedback data leads to better accuracy and increases the attraction of the system to the users. Additionally, there is a growing consensus that accuracy alone is not enough and user satisfaction is also dependent on diverse recommendations. In this work, we tackle this problem of updating personalized recommendation lists for interactive applications in order to provide both accurate and diverse recommendations. To that end, we explore algorithms that exploit random walks as a sampling technique to obtain diverse recommendations without compromising on efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we present a novel graph vertex ranking recommendation algorithm called $$RP^3_Î² that reranks items based on three-hop random walk transition probabilities. We show empirically that RP3Î² provides accurate recommendations with high long-tail item frequency at the top of the recommendation list. We also present approximate versions of RP3Î² and the two most accurate previously published vertex ranking algorithms based on random walk transition probabilities and show that these approximations converge with an increasing number of samples. To obtain interactively updatable recommendations, we additionally show how our algorithm can be extended for online updates at interactive speeds. The underlying random walk sampling technique makes it possible to perform the updates without having to recompute the values for the entire dataset. In an empirical evaluation with three real-world datasets, we show that RP3$Î²$ provides highly accurate and diverse recommendations that can easily be updated with newly gathered information at interactive speeds (&Lt; 100ms)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7268","fieldValue":" What makes a good recommendation or good list of recommendations? Research into recommender systems has traditionally focused on accuracy, in particular how closely the recommenderâ\u20AC™s predicted ratings are to the usersâ\u20AC™ true ratings. However, it has been recognized that other recommendation qualitiesâ\u20AC\u201Dsuch as whether the list of recommendations is diverse and whether it contains novel itemsâ\u20AC\u201Dmay have a significant impact on the overall quality of a recommender system. Consequently, in recent years, the focus of recommender systems research has shifted to include a wider range of â\u20ACœbeyond accuracyâ\u20AC? objectives. In this article, we present a survey of the most discussed beyond-accuracy objectives in recommender systems research: diversity, serendipity, novelty, and coverage. We review the definitions of these objectives and corresponding metrics found in the literature. We also review works that propose optimization strategies for these beyond-accuracy objectives. Since the majority of works focus on one specific objective, we find that it is not clear how the different objectives relate to each other. Hence, we conduct a set of offline experiments aimed at comparing the performance of different optimization approaches with a view to seeing how they affect objectives other than the ones they are optimizing. We use a set of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms optimized for recall along with a number of reranking strategies for optimizing the diversity, novelty, and serendipity of the generated recommendations. For each reranking strategy, we measure the effects on the other beyond-accuracy objectives and demonstrate important insights into the correlations between the discussed objectives. For instance, we find that rating-based diversity is positively correlated with novelty, and we demonstrate the positive influence of novelty on recommendation coverage."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7268","fieldValue":"Diversity, Serendipity, Novelty, and Coverage: A Survey and Empirical Analysis of Beyond-Accuracy Objectives in Recommender Systems"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7268","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7268","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7269","fieldValue":"Li, Yu-Ting"}
