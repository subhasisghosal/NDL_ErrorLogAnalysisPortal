It transforms the everyday objects that surround us into proactive actors of the Internet, generating and consuming information. An important issue related to the appearance of such a large-scale self-coordinating IoT is the reliability and the collaboration between the objects in the presence of environmental hazards. High failure rates lead to significant loss of data. Therefore, data survivability is a main challenge of the IoT. In this article, we have developed a compartmental e-Epidemic SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model to save the data in the network and let it survive after attacks. Furthermore, our model takes into account the dynamic topology of the network where natural death (crashing nodes) and birth are defined and analyzed. Theoretical methods and simulations are employed to solve and simulate the system of equations developed and to analyze the model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24516","fieldValue":"Leung, Kenneth Wai-Ting"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24516","fieldValue":" The semantic network is a form of knowledge that represents various relationships between concepts with ambiguity. The knowledge can be employed to identify semantically related objects. It helps, for example, a recommender system to generate effective recommendations to the users. We propose to study a new semantic network, namely, the Concept Relation Network (CRN), which is efficiently constructed and maintained using existing web search engines. CRN tackles the uncertainty and dynamics of web content, and thus is optimized for many important web applications, such as social networks and search engines. It is a large semantic network for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of web content, and serves as a cornerstone for applications such as web search engines, recommendation systems, and social networks that can benefit from a large-scale knowledge base. In this article, we present two applications for CRN: (1) search engine and web analytic and (2) semantic information retrieval. Experimental results show that CRN effectively enhances these applications by considering the heterogenous and polysemous nature of web content."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24516","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24516","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24517","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a Statistical Cloud-Assisted Reputation Estimation (sCARE) approach for service-oriented environments in uncertain situations. sCARE uses the ratings from cooperating service consumers to uniformly describe the randomness and fuzziness of the different submitted ratings and their associated relationships in quantitative terms. We also define discriminant functions to model the honesty (or lack thereof) of the service raters. Experiment results show that our proposed model performs in a fairly accurate manner for a number of real-world scenarios. A comparison study with similar existing works is also provided to asses sCAREâ\u20AC™s performance."}
