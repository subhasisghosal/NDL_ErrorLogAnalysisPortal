However, only two of the simplest ones are used in commercial products. To better understand the benefits offered by the more sophisticated variations, we conduct an analytical comparison of well-known bitmap indexes, most of which are in the class of multi-component bitmap indexes. Our analysis is the first to fully incorporate the effects of compression on their performance. We produce closed-form formulas for both the index sizes and the query processing costs for the worst cases. One surprising finding is that the two simple indexes are in fact the best among multi-component indexes. Additionally, we investigate a number of novel variations in a class of multi-level indexes, and find that they answer queries faster than the best of multi-component indexes. More specifically, some two-level indexes are predicted by analyses and verified with experiments to be 5 to 10 times faster than well-known indexes. Furthermore, these two-level indexes have the optimal computational complexity for answering queries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14499","fieldValue":" Reverse skyline queries over uncertain databases have many important applications such as sensor data monitoring and business planning. Due to the wide existence of uncertainty in many real-world data, answering reverse skyline queries accurately and efficiently over uncertain data has become increasingly important. In this article, we formalize the probabilistic reverse skyline query over uncertain data, in both monochromatic and bichromatic cases, and propose effective pruning methods, namely spatial pruning and probabilistic pruning, to reduce the search space of the reverse skyline query processing. Moreover, efficient query procedures have been presented seamlessly integrating the proposed pruning methods. Furthermore, a novel query type, namely Probabilistic Reverse Furthest Skyline (PRFS) query, is proposed and tackled under â\u20ACœthe larger, the betterâ\u20AC? dominance semantics of skyline. Variants of probabilistic reverse skyline have been proposed and tackled, including those that return objects with top-k highest probabilities and that retrieve top-k reverse skylines. Extensive experiments demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our approaches with various experimental settings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14499","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14499","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14500","fieldValue":" When integrating data from autonomous sources, exact matches of data items that represent the same real-world object often fail due to a lack of common keys. Yet in many cases structural information is available and can be used to match such data. Typically the matching must be approximate since the representations in the sources differ. We propose pq-grams to approximately match hierarchical data from autonomous sources and define the pq-gram distance between ordered labeled trees as an effective and efficient approximation of the fanout weighted tree edit distance. We prove that the pq-gram distance is a lower bound of the fanout weighted tree edit distance and give a normalization of the pq-gram distance for which the triangle inequality holds. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data (residential addresses and XML) confirm the scalability of our approach and show the effectiveness of pq-grams."}
