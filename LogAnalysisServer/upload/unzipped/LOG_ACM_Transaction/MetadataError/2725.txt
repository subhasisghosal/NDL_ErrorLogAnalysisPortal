A novel feature of this package is that it employs high order, adaptive methods in both time and space, controlling and balancing both spatial and temporal error estimates. The software implements a spline collocation method at Gaussian points, with a B-spline basis, for the spatial discretization. The time integration is performed using a modification of the popular DAE solver, DASSL. Based on the computation of a second, higher order, global solution, a high quality a posteriori spatial error estimate is obtained after each successful time step. The spatial error is controlled by a sophisticated new mesh selection algorithm based on an equidistribution principle. In this article we describe the overall structure of the BACOL package, and in particular the modifications to the DASSL package that improve its performance within BACOL. An example is provided in the online Appendix to illustrate the use of the package."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19074","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19074","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19075","fieldValue":"Olver, F.

The module also computes the zeros and associated values of the solutions and their derivatives, and the modulus and phase functions on the negative real axis. The computational methods are numerical integration of the differential equation and summation of asymptotic expansions for large argument. These methods were chosen because they are simple, adaptable to any precision, and amenable to rigorous error analysis. The module can be used to validate other codes or as a component in programs that require Airy functions."}
