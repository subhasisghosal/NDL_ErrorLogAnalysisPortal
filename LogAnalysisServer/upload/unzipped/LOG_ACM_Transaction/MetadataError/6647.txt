The assumption is that, if a term appears once in a document, it is more likely to appear again in the same document. Thus, as the term appears again and again, the information content of the subsequent occurrences decreases gradually, since they are more predictable. We introduce a parameterized decay function to model this assumption, where the initial contribution of the term can be determined using any reasonable term discrimination factor. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on a number of recent web test collections of varying nature. The experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms a number of well known retrieval models including a recently proposed strong Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7697","fieldValue":" Heterogeneous face recognition, also known as cross-modality face recognition or intermodality face recognition, refers to matching two face images from alternative image modalities. Since face images from different image modalities of the same person are associated with the same face object, there should be mutual components that reflect those intrinsic face characteristics that are invariant to the image modalities. Motivated by this rationality, we propose a novel approach called Mutual Component Analysis (MCA) to infer the mutual components for robust heterogeneous face recognition. In the MCA approach, a generative model is first proposed to model the process of generating face images in different modalities, and then an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is designed to iteratively learn the model parameters. The learned generative model is able to infer the mutual components (which we call the hidden factor, where hidden means the factor is unreachable and invisible, and can only be inferred from observations) that are associated with the personâ\u20AC™s identity, thus enabling fast and effective matching for cross-modality face recognition. To enhance recognition performance, we propose an MCA-based multiclassifier framework using multiple local features. Experimental results show that our new approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art results on two typical application scenarios: sketch-to-photo and infrared-to-visible face recognition."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7697","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7697","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7698","fieldValue":" Document summarization is playing an important role in coping with information overload on the Web. Many summarization models have been proposed recently, but few try to adjust the summary length and sentence order according to application scenarios. With the popularity of handheld devices, presenting key information first in summaries of flexible length is of great convenience in terms of faster reading and decision-making and network consumption reduction. Targeting this problem, we introduce a novel task of generating summaries of incremental length. In particular, we require that the summaries should have the ability to automatically adjust the coverage of general-detailed information when the summary length varies. We propose a novel summarization model that incrementally maximizes topic coverage based on the documentâ\u20AC™s hierarchical topic model. In addition to the standard Rouge-1 measure, we define a new evaluation metric based on the similarity of the summariesâ\u20AC™ topic coverage distribution in order to account for sentence order and summary length. Extensive experiments on Wikipedia pages, DUC 2007, and general noninverted writing style documents from multiple sources show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Moreover, we carry out a user study on a mobile application scenario to show the usability of the produced summary in terms of improving judgment accuracy and speed, as well as reducing the reading burden and network traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7698","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7698","fieldValue":"ACM"}
