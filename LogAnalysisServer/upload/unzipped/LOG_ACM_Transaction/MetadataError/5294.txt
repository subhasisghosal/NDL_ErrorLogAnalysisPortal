The Kimura's three-substitution-types (K3ST) model of evolution, allows analytical expression for these probabilities of by means of the Hadamard conjugation as a function of the phylogeny T and the substitution probabilities on each edge of TM . In this paper we produce a direct combinatorial proof of these results, using pathset distances which generalise pairwise distances between sequences. This interpretation provides us with tools that were proved useful in related problems in the mathematical analysis of sequence evolution."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4375","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4376","fieldValue":" Split networks are increasingly being used in phylogenetic analysis. Usually, a simple equal angle algorithm is used to draw such networks, producing layouts that leave much room for improvement. Addressing the problem of producing better layouts of split networks, this paper presents an algorithm for maximizing the area covered by the network, describes an extension of the equal-daylight algorithm to networks, looks into using a spring embedder and discusses how to construct rooted split networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4376","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4120","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
