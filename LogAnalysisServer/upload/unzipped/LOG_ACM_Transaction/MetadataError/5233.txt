The distance of the permutation is defined as the length of such a sequence. Despite the apparently intuitive nature of this problem, introduced in 1995 by Bafna and Pevzner, the complexity of both finding an optimal sequence and computing the distance remains open today. In this paper, we establish connections between two different graph representations of permutations, which allows us to compute the distance of a few nontrivial classes of permutations in linear time and space, bypassing the use of any graph structure. By showing that every permutation can be obtained from one of these classes, we prove a new tight upper bound on the transposition distance. Finally, we give improved bounds on some other families of permutations and prove formulas for computing the exact distance of other classes of permutations, again in polynomial time."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4259","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4260","fieldValue":" Traditional sequence comparison by alignment employs a mutation model comprised of two events, substitutions and indels (insertions or deletions) of single positions. However, modern genetic analysis knows a variety of more complex mutation events (e.g., duplications, excisions, and rearrangements), especially regarding DNA. With ever more DNA sequence data becoming available, the need to accurately compare sequences which have clearly undergone more complicated types of mutational processes is becoming critical. Herein we introduce a new method for pairwise alignment and comparison of sequences with respect to the special evolution of tandem repeats: substitutions and indels of single positions and, additionally, duplications and excisions of variable degree (i.e., of one or more repeat copies simultaneously) are taken into account. To evaluate our method, we apply it to the spa VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) cluster of Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium of high medical importance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4260","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4260","fieldValue":"Sequence comparison, tandem repeats, variable number of tandem repeats, repeat duplication history, pairwise alignment, dynamic programming."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4260","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4260","fieldValue":"ACM"}
