R-D models enable optimization of the received video quality in different network conditions. Several R-D models have been proposed for the increasingly popular fine-grained scalable video sequences. However, the models' relative performance has not been thoroughly analyzed. Moreover, the time complexity of each model is not known, nor is the range of bitrates in which the model produces valid results. This lack of quantitative performance analysis makes it difficult to select the model that best suits a target streaming system. In this article, we classify, analyze, and rigorously evaluate all R-D models proposed for FGS coders in the literature. We classify R-D models into three categories: analytic, empirical, and semi-analytic. We describe the characteristics of each category. We analyze the R-D models by following their mathematical derivations, scrutinizing the assumptions made, and explaining when the assumptions fail and why. In addition, we implement all R-D models, a total of eight, and evaluate them using a diverse set of video sequences. In our evaluation, we consider various source characteristics, diverse channel conditions, different encoding\/decoding parameters, different frame types, and several performance metrics including accuracy, range of applicability, and time complexity of each model. We also present clear systematic ways (pseudo codes) for constructing various R-D models from a given video sequence. Based on our experimental results, we present a justified list of recommendations on selecting the best R-D models for video-on-demand, video conferencing, real-time, and peer-to-peer streaming systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25310","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25310","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25311","fieldValue":" TCP is widely used in commercial multimedia streaming systems, with recent measurement studies indicating that a significant fraction of Internet streaming media is currently delivered over HTTP\/TCP. These observations motivate us to develop analytic performance models to systematically investigate the performance of TCP for both live and stored-media streaming. We validate our models via ns simulations and experiments conducted over the Internet. Our models provide guidelines indicating the circumstances under which TCP streaming leads to satisfactory performance, showing, for example, that TCP generally provides good streaming performance when the achievable TCP throughput is roughly twice the media bitrate, with only a few seconds of startup delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25311","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25311","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25312","fieldValue":"Lin, Po-Chiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25312","fieldValue":" The access of multimedia computing in wireless networks is concerned with the performance of handoff because of the irretrievable property of real-time data delivery. To lessen throughput degradation incurred by unnecessary handoffs or handoff latencies leading to media disruption perceived by users, this paper presents a link quality based handoff algorithm. Neural networks are used to learn the cross-layer correlation between the link quality estimator such as packet success rate and the corresponding context metric indictors, for example, the transmitting packet length, received signal strength, and signal to noise ratio. Based on a pre-processed learning of link quality profile, neural networks make essential handoff decisions efficiently with the evaluations of link quality instead of the comparisons between relative signal strength. The experiment and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves the user perceived qualities in a transmission scenario of VoIP applications by minimizing both the number of lost packets and unnecessary handoffs."}
