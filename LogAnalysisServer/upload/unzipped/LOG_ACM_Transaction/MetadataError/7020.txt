{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1791","fieldValue":" A two-tier Internet data center management scheme, TACOMA, with thermal-aware server provisioning (TASP) in one tier, and thermal-aware workload distribution (TAWD) in the other is proposed. TASP and TAWD coordinate to maximize the energy savings by leveraging the workload dynamics, at coarse and fine time scale, respectively. TACOMA is aware of the QoS constraints, the energy proportionality of servers, and the potential trade-off between cooling and computing power. The obtained energy savings are a combination of suspending idle servers, using servers at their peak efficiency, and avoiding heat recirculation."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1791","fieldValue":"TACOMA: Server and workload management in internet data centers considering cooling-computing power trade-off and energy proportionality"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8838","fieldValue":"Lee, Tsern-Huei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8838","fieldValue":"Lai, Kuen-Chu"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8838","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8322","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
