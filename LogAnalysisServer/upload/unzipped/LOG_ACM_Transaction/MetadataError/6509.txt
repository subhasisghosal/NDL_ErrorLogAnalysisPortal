We have been actively developing this package since the year 2000. The goal is to help users to easily apply SVM to their applications. LIBSVM has gained wide popularity in machine learning and many other areas. In this article, we present all implementation details of LIBSVM. Issues such as solving SVM optimization problems theoretical convergence multiclass classification probability estimates and parameter selection are discussed in detail."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7351","fieldValue":" We describe and evaluate two algorithms for Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification problem which has been recently shown to be of a particular importance for bipartite ranking problems.

Empirical evidences illustrate the potential of the proposed methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7352","fieldValue":" Recommender systems have been well studied and developed, both in academia and in industry recently. However, traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the connections among users, which is not consistent with the real-world observations where we always turn to our trusted friends for recommendations. Aiming at modeling recommender systems more accurately and realistically, we propose a novel probabilistic factor analysis framework which naturally fuses the users' tastes and their trusted friends' favors together. The proposed framework is quite general, and it can also be applied to pure user-item rating matrix even if we do not have explicit social trust information among users. In this framework, we coin the term social trust ensemble to represent the formulation of the social trust restrictions on the recommender systems. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."}
