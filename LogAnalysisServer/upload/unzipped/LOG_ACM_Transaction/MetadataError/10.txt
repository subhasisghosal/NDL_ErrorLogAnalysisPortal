Each user can receive a new file only after its previous file is finished. The file state processes for each user act as coupled Markov chains that form a generalized restless bandit system. First, an optimal algorithm is derived for the case of one user. The algorithm maximizes throughput subject to an average power constraint. Next, the one-user algorithm is extended to a low-complexity heuristic for the multiuser problem. The heuristic uses a simple online index policy. In a special case with no power-constraint, the multiuser heuristic is shown to be throughput-optimal. Simulations are used to demonstrate effectiveness of the heuristic in the general case. For simple cases where the optimal solution can be computed offline, the heuristic is shown to be near-optimal for a wide range of parameters."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11010","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11010","fieldValue":"Power-Aware Wireless File Downloading: A Lyapunov Indexing Approach to a Constrained Restless Bandit Problem"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11011","fieldValue":"Lee, Chul-Ho"}
