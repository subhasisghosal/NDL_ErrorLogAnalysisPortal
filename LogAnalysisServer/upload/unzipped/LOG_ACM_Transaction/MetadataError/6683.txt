{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7837","fieldValue":" Using a mixture of random variables to model data is a tried-and-tested method common in data mining, machine learning, and statistics. By using mixture modeling it is often possible to accurately model even complex, multimodal data via very simple components. However, the classical mixture model assumes that a data point is generated by a single component in the model. A lot of datasets can be modeled closer to the underlying reality if we drop this restriction. We propose a probabilistic framework, the mixture-of-subsets (MOS) model, by making two fundamental changes to the classical mixture model. First, we allow a data point to be generated by a set of components, rather than just a single component. Next, we limit the number of data attributes that each component can influence. We also propose an EM framework to learn the MOS model from a dataset, and experimentally evaluate it on real, high-dimensional datasets. Our results show that the MOS model learned from the data represents the underlying nature of the data accurately."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7837","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7837","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7838","fieldValue":" Clustering, as an unsupervised learning process is a challenging problem, especially in cases of high-dimensional datasets. Clustering result quality can benefit from user constraints and objective validity assessment. In this article, we propose a semisupervised framework for learning the weighted Euclidean subspace, where the best clustering can be achieved. Our approach capitalizes on: (i) user constraints; and (ii) the quality of intermediate clustering results in terms of their structural properties. The proposed framework uses the clustering algorithm and the validity measure as its parameters. We develop and discuss algorithms for learning and tuning the weights of contributing dimensions and defining the â\u20ACœbestâ\u20AC? clustering obtained by satisfying user constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of improved clustering accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7839","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7839","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7840","fieldValue":" High-throughput biological screens are yielding ever-growing streams of information about multiple aspects of cellular activity. As more and more categories of datasets come online, there is a corresponding multitude of ways in which inferences can be chained across them, motivating the need for compositional data mining algorithms. In this article, we argue that such compositional data mining can be effectively realized by functionally cascading redescription mining and biclustering algorithms as primitives. Both these primitives mirror shifts of vocabulary that can be composed in arbitrary ways to create rich chains of inferences. Given a relational database and its schema, we show how the schema can be automatically compiled into a compositional data mining program, and how different domains in the schema can be related through logical sequences of biclustering and redescription invocations. This feature allows us to rapidly prototype new data mining applications, yielding greater understanding of scientific datasets. We describe two applications of compositional data mining: (i) matching terms across categories of the Gene Ontology and (ii) understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying stress response in human cells."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7840","fieldValue":"ACM"}
