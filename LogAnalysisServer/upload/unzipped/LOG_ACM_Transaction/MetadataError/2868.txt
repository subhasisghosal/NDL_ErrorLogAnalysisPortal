{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19394","fieldValue":" The hp version of the finite element method (hp-FEM) combined with adaptive mesh refinement is a particularly efficient method for solving PDEs because it can achieve an exponential convergence rate in the number of degrees of freedom. hp-FEM allows for refinement in both the element size, h, and the polynomial degree, p. Like adaptive refinement for the h version of the finite element method, a posteriori error estimates can be used to determine where the mesh needs to be refined, but a single error estimate cannot simultaneously determine whether it is better to do the refinement by h or p. Several strategies for making this determination have been proposed over the years. These strategies are summarized, and the results of a numerical experiment to study the performance of these strategies is presented. It was found that the reference-solution-based methods are very effective, but also considerably more expensive, in terms of computation time, than other approaches. The method based on a priori knowledge is very effective when there are known point singularities. The method based on the decay rate of the expansion coefficients appears to be the best choice as a general strategy across all categories of problems, whereas many of the other strategies perform well in particular situations and are reasonable in general."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19394","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19394","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19395","fieldValue":" We present a parallel sparse direct solver for multicore architectures based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scheduling. Recently, DAG scheduling has become popular in advanced Dense Linear Algebra libraries due to its efficient asynchronous parallel execution of tasks. However, its application to sparse matrix problems is more challenging as it has to deal with an enormous number of highly irregular tasks. This typically results in substantial scheduling overhead both in time and space, which causes overall parallel performance to be suboptimal. We describe a parallel solver based on two-level task parallelism: tasks are first generated from a parallel tree traversal on the assembly tree; next, those tasks are further refined by using algorithms-by-blocks to gain fine-grained parallelism. The resulting fine-grained tasks are asynchronously executed after their dependencies are analyzed. Our approach is distinct from others in that we adopt two-level task scheduling to mirror the two-level parallelism. As a result, we reduce scheduling overhead, and increase efficiency and flexibility. The proposed parallel sparse direct solver is evaluated for the particular problems arising from the hp-Finite Element Method where conventional sparse direct solvers do not scale well."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19395","fieldValue":"LU"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19395","fieldValue":"LU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19396","fieldValue":" We present a simple method to solve spherical harmonics moment systems, such as the the time-dependent PN and SPN equations, of radiative transfer. The method, which works for arbitrary moment order N, makes use of the specific coupling between the moments in the PN equations. This coupling naturally induces staggered grids in space and time, which in turn give rise to a canonical, second-order accurate finite difference scheme. While the scheme does not possess TVD or realizability limiters, its simplicity allows for a very efficient implementation in Matlab. We present several test cases, some of which demonstrate that the code solves problems with ten million degrees of freedom in space, angle, and time within a few seconds. The code for the numerical scheme, called StaRMAP (Staggered grid Radiation Moment Approximation), along with files for all presented test cases, can be downloaded so that all results can be reproduced by the reader."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19396","fieldValue":"StaRMAP---A Second Order Staggered Grid Method for Spherical Harmonics Moment Equations of Radiative Transfer"}
