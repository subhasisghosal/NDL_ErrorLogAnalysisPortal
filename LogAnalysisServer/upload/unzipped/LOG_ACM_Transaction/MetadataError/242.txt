Many important properties are dependent on the cumulated time that the device spends in certain states, possibly intermittently. We study the problem of verifying continuous-time Markov Chains (CTMCs) against Linear Duration Properties (LDP), that is, properties stated as conjunctions of linear constraints over the total duration of time spent in states that satisfy a given property. We identify two classes of LDP properties, Eventuality Duration Properties (EDP) and Invariance Duration Properties (IDP), respectively referring to the reachability of a set of goal states, within a time bound; and the continuous satisfaction of a duration property over an execution path. The central question that we address is how to compute the probability of the set of infinite timed paths of the CTMC that satisfy a given LDP. We present algorithms to approximate these probabilities up to a given precision, stating their complexity and error bounds. The algorithms mainly employ an adaptation of uniformisation and the computation of volumes of multidimensional integrals under systems of linear constraints, together with different mechanisms to bound the errors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11688","fieldValue":" We develop a cut-free nested sequent calculus as basis for a proof search procedure for an intuitionistic modal logic of actions and propositions. The actions act on propositions via a dynamic modality (the weakest precondition of program logics), whose left adjoint we refer to as â\u20ACœupdateâ\u20AC? (the strongest postcondition). The logic has agent-indexed adjoint pairs of epistemic modalities: the left adjoints encode agents' uncertainties and the right adjoints encode their beliefs. The rules for the â\u20ACœupdateâ\u20AC? modality encode learning as a result of discarding uncertainty. We prove admissibility of Cut, and hence the soundness and completeness of the logic with respect to an algebraic semantics. We interpret the logic on epistemic scenarios that consist of honest and dishonest communication actions, add assumption rules to encode them, and prove that the calculus with the assumption rules still has the admissibility results. We apply the calculus to encode (and allow reasoning about) the classic epistemic puzzles of dirty children (a.k.a. â\u20ACœmuddy childrenâ\u20AC?) and drinking logicians and some versions with dishonesty or noise; we also give an application where the actions are movements of a robot rather than announcements."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11688","fieldValue":"Algebra, proof theory and applications for an intuitionistic logic of propositions, actions and adjoint modal operators"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11688","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11688","fieldValue":"ACM"}
