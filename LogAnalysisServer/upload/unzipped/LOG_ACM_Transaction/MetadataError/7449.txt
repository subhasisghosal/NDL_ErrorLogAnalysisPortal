{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1878","fieldValue":" The design process of a microprocessor requires representative workloads to steer the search process toward an optimum design point for the target application domain. However, considering a broad set of workloads to cover the large space of potential workloads is infeasible given how time-consuming design space exploration typically is. Hence, it is crucial to select a small yet representative set of workloads, which leads to a shorter design cycle while yielding a (near) optimal design. Prior work has mostly looked into selecting representative benchmarks; however, limited attention was given to the selection of benchmark inputs and how this affects workload representativeness during design space exploration. Using a set of 1,000 inputs for a number of embedded benchmarks and a design space with around 1,700 design points, we find that selecting a single or three random input(s) per benchmark potentially (in a worst-case scenario) leads to a suboptimal design that is 56&percnt; and 33&percnt; off, on average, relative to the optimal design in our design space in terms of Energy-Delay Product (EDP). We then propose and evaluate a number of methods for selecting representative inputs and show that we can find the optimum design point with as few as three inputs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1878","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1878","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9710","fieldValue":" The size of a single-hop cross-bar fabric is still limited by the technology, and the fabrics available on the market do not exceed the terabit capacity. A multihop fabric such as Clos network provides the higher capacity by using the smaller switching elements (SE). When the traffic load is balanced over the switches in a middle stage, all the traffic would get through the fabric, as long as the switch outputs are not overloaded. However, the delay that packets experience through the Clos switch depends on the granularity of flows that are balanced. We examine the maximum fabric utilization under which a tolerable delay is provided for various load balancing algorithms, and derive the general formula for this utilization in terms of the number of flows that are balanced. We show that the algorithms which balance flows with sufficiently coarse granularity provide both high fabric utilization and delay guarantees to the most sensitive applications. Since no admission control should be performed within the switch, the fast traffic-pattern changes can be accommodated in the proposed scalable architecture."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9710","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9711","fieldValue":" Low latency is a critical requirement in some switching applications, specifically in parallel computer interconnection networks. The minimum latency in switches with centralized scheduling comprises two components, namely, the control-path latency and the data-path latency, which in a practical high-capacity, distributed switch implementation can be far greater than the cell duration. We introduce a speculative transmission scheme to significantly reduce the average control-path latency by allowing cells to proceed without waiting for a grant, under certain conditions. It operates in conjunction with any centralized matching algorithm to achieve a high maximum utilization and incorporates a reliable delivery mechanism to deal with failed speculations. An analytical model is presented to investigate the efficiency of the speculative transmission scheme employed in a non-blocking N Ã\u2014 NR input-queued crossbar switch with R receivers per output. Using this model, performance measures such as the mean delay and the rate of successful speculative transmissions are derived. The results demonstrate that the control-path latency can be almost entirely eliminated for loads up to 50%. Our simulations confirm the analytical results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9711","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9711","fieldValue":"ACM"}
