We first review typical traffic models to represent the application workloads in NoC. Specifically, we review Markovian and non-Markovian (e.g., self-similar or long-range memory-dependent) traffic models and discuss their applications on multicore platform design. Then, we review the analytical techniques to predict NoC performance under given input traffic. We investigate analytical models for average as well as maximum delay evaluation. We also review the developments and design challenges of NoC simulators. One interesting research direction in NoC performance evaluation consists of combining simulation and analytical models in order to exploit their advantages together. Toward this end, we discuss several newly proposed approaches that use hardware-based or learning-based techniques. Finally, we summarize several open problems and our perspective to address these challenges."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13516","fieldValue":" This work investigates selecting paths for communication flows when deploying a hard real-time application on a chip-multiprocessor system. This chip-multiprocessor system uses a priority-aware real-time network-on-chip interconnect between the processors. Given a mapping of the computation tasks onto the chip-multiprocessor, the problem we address in this work is to discover paths the communication flows take such that hard real-time deadlines of flows are met. Furthermore, we must ensure that deadlines are met even in the presence of direct and indirect interference from other flows sharing network links on the path. To achieve this, our algorithm utilizes a stage-level analysis for real-time communication to determine the impact of a network link being used by a flow, and its effect on other flows sharing the link. The path selection algorithm uses heuristics such as selecting links with least interference, and considering lower-priority flows when dedicating links to paths of higher-priority flows since an optimal one is intractable. The algorithm also considers constraints on the number of virtual channels at each router port in the network. The statistically significant experimental results show an improvement in schedulability by 5&percnt; and 12&percnt; over existing path selection algorithms such as Minimum Interference Routing and Widest Shortest Path algorithms, respectively. We also present a set-top box case study to further illustrate the benefits of using the proposed algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13516","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13516","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13517","fieldValue":"Young, Evangeline F Y"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13517","fieldValue":" To reduce chip-scale topography variation, dummy fill is commonly used to improve the layout density uniformity. Previous works either sought the most uniform density distribution or sought to minimize the inserted dummy fills while satisfying certain density uniformity constraint. However, due to more stringent manufacturing challenges, more criteria, like line deviation and outlier, emerge at newer technology nodes. This article presents a joint optimization scheme to consider variation, total fill, line deviation, outlier, overlap, and running time simultaneously. More specifically, first we decompose the rectilinear polygons and partition fillable regions into rectangles for easier processing. After decomposition, we insert dummy fills into the fillable rectangular regions optimizing the fill metrics simultaneously. We propose three approaches, Fast Median approach, LP approach, and Iterative approach, which are much faster with better quality, compared with the results of the top three contestants in the ICCAD Contest 2014."}
