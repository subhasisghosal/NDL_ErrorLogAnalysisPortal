Existing research has demonstrated that an effective Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) algorithm and wavelength conversion are two primary vehicles for improving the blocking performance. However, these two issues have largely been investigated separately; in particular the existing RWA algorithms have seldom considered the presence of wavelength conversion. In this paper, we firstly demonstrate that the existing dynamic RWA algorithms do not work well in the presence of wavelength conversion as they usually only take into account the current traffic, and do not explicitly consider the route lengths. We then propose a weighted least-congestion routing and first-fit wavelength assignment (WLCR-FF) algorithm that considers both the current traffic load and the route lengths jointly. We further introduce an analytical model that can evaluate the blocking performance for WLCR algorithm. We carry out extensive numerical studies over typical topologies including ring, mesh-torus, and the 14-node NSFNET; and compare the performance of WLCR-FF with a wide variety of existing routing algorithms including static routing, fixed-alternate routing and least-loaded routing. The results conclusively demonstrate that the proposed WLCR-FF algorithm can achieve much better blocking performance in the presence of sparse or\/and full wavelength conversion."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9362","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9362","fieldValue":"Dynamic routing and wavelength assignment in the presence of wavelength conversion for all-optical networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8363","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9363","fieldValue":"Van Mieghem, Piet F A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9363","fieldValue":" Finding a path in a network based on multiple constraints (the MCP problem) is often considered an integral part of quality of service (QoS) routing. QoS routing with constraints on multiple additive measures has been proven to be NP-complete. This proof has dramatically influenced the research community, resulting into the common belief that exact QoS routing is intractable in practice. However, to our knowledge, no one has ever examined which \"worst cases\" lead to intractability. In fact, the MCP problem is not strong NP-complete, suggesting that in practice an exact QoS routing algorithm may work in polynomial time. The goal of this paper is to argue that in practice QoS routing may be tractable. We will provide properties, an approximate analysis, and simulation results to indicate that NP-completeness hinges on four conditions, namely: 1) the topology; 2) the granularity of link weights; 3) the correlation between link weights; and 4) the constraints. We expect that, in practice, these conditions are manageable and therefore believe that exact QoS routing is tractable in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9363","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
