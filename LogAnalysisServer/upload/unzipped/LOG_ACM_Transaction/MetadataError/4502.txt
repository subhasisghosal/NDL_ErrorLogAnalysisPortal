To date, most existing work on diffusion sources detection are based on the assumption that network snapshots that reflect information diffusion can be obtained continuously. However, obtaining snapshots of an entire network needs to deploy detectors on all network nodes and thus is very expensive. Alternatively, in this article, we study the diffusion sources locating problem by learning from information diffusion data collected from only a small subset of network nodes. Specifically, we present a new regression learning model that can detect anomalous diffusion sources by jointly solving five challenges, that is, unknown number of source nodes, few activated detectors, unknown initial propagation time, uncertain propagation path and uncertain propagation time delay. We theoretically analyze the strength of the model and derive performance bounds. We empirically test and compare the model using both synthetic and real-world networks to demonstrate its performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24513","fieldValue":"Baba-Hamed, Latifa"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24513","fieldValue":" One of the main challenges in data matching and data cleaning, in highly integrated systems, is duplicates detection. While the literature abounds of approaches detecting duplicates corresponding to the same real-world entity, most of these approaches tend to eliminate duplicates (wrong information) from the sources, hence leading to what is called data repair. In this article, we propose a framework that automatically detects duplicates at query time and effectively identifies the consistent version of the data, while keeping inconsistent data in the sources. Our framework uses matching dependencies (MDs) to detect duplicates through the concept of data reconciliation rules (DRR) and conditional function dependencies (CFDs) to assess the quality of different attribute values. We also build a duplicate reconciliation index (DRI), based on clusters of duplicates detected by a set of DRRs to speed up the online data reconciliation process. Our experiments of a real-world data collection show the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24514","fieldValue":" Uncertain data streams have been widely generated in many Web applications. The uncertainty in data streams makes anomaly detection from sensor data streams far more challenging. In this article, we present a novel framework that supports anomaly detection in uncertain data streams. The proposed framework adopts the wavelet soft-thresholding method to remove the noises or errors in data streams. Based on the refined data streams, we develop effective period pattern recognition and feature extraction techniques to improve the computational efficiency. We use classification methods for anomaly detection in the corrected data stream. We also empirically show that the proposed approach shows a high accuracy of anomaly detection on several real datasets."}
