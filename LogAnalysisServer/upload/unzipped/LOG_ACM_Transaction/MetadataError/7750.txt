We propose an optimization framework for selecting the positions of wireless sensors to detect mobile targets traversing a given area. By leveraging the concept of path exposure as a measure of detection quality, we propose two problem versions: the minimization of the sensors installation cost while guaranteeing a minimum exposure, and the maximization of the exposure of the least-exposed path subject to a budget on the sensors installation cost. We present compact mixed-integer linear programming formulations for these problems that can be solved to optimality for reasonable-sized network instances. Moreover, we develop Tabu Search heuristics that are able to provide near-optimal solutions of the same instances in short computing time and also tackle large size instances. The basic versions are extended to account for constraints on the wireless connectivity as well as heterogeneous devices and nonuniform sensing. Finally, we analyze an enhanced exposure definition based on mobile target detection probability."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10312","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10312","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10312","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10313","fieldValue":" This paper investigates design methods of protection schemes in survivable WDM networks that use preconfigured protection structures (p-structures) in order to provide different quality-of-recovery (QoR) classes within 100% resilient single-link protection schemes. QoR differentiation is a practical and effective approach in order to strike different balances among protection cost, recovery delay, and management complexity. Based on the degree of pre-cross connectivity of the protection structures, we develop three design approaches of shared protection capacity schemes based on the following: 1) fully pre-cross-connected p-structures (fp-structures); 2) partially pre-cross-connected p-structures (pp-structures); and 3) dynamically reconfigured p-structures (dp-structures). In order to identify the optimal combinations of protection structures to meet the requirements of the three QoR classes, we use a column generation (CG) model that we solve using large-scale optimization techniques. Our CG decomposition approach is based on the separation processes of the design and selection of the protection structures. In the design process of the protection structures, the shape and protection capability of each p-structure is decided dynamically during the selection process depending on the network topology and the targeted QoR parameters. Extensive experiments are carried out on several data instances with different design constraints in order to measure the protection capacity cost and the recovery delay for the three QoR classes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10313","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10313","fieldValue":"ACM"}
