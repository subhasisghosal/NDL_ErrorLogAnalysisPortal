This paper focuses on the development and evaluation of two measures of the ratio between speech energy and music energy: a reference measure called speech-to-music ratio (SMR), which is known objectively only prior to mixing, and a feature called the stereo-input mix-to-peripheral level feature (SIMPL), which is computed from the stereo mixed signal as an imprecise estimate of SMR. SIMPL is an objective signal measure calculated by taking advantage of broadcast mixing techniques in which vocals are typically placed at stereo center, unlike most instruments. Conversely, SMR is a hidden variable defined by the relationship between the powers of portions of audio attributed to speech and music. It is shown that SIMPL is predictive of SMR and can be combined with state-of-the-art features in order to improve performance. For evaluation, this new metric is applied in speech\/music (binary) classification, speech\/music\/mixed (trinary) classification, and a new speech-to-music ratio estimation problem. Promising results are achieved, including 93.06% accuracy for trinary classification and 3.86 dB RMSE for estimation of the SMR."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3742","fieldValue":" This paper is devoted to the study and analysis of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) filters for noise reduction both in the time and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domains with one single microphone and multiple microphones. In the time domain, we show that the maximum SNR filters can significantly increase the SNR but at the expense of tremendous speech distortion. As a consequence, the speech quality improvement, measured by the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) algorithm, is marginal if any, regardless of the number of microphones used. In the STFT domain, the maximum SNR filters are formulated by considering the interframe information in every frequency band. It is found that these filters not only improve the SNR, but also improve the speech quality significantly. As the number of input channels increases so is the gain in SNR as well as the speech quality. This demonstrates that the maximum SNR filters, particularly the multichannel ones, in the STFT domain may be of great practical value."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3743","fieldValue":" Extractive multi-document summarization systems usually rank sentences in a document set with some ranking strategy and then select a few highly ranked sentences into the summary. One of the most popular ranking algorithms is the graph-based ranking algorithm. In this paper, we investigate making use of semantic role information to enhance the graph-based ranking algorithm for multi-document summarization. We first parse the sentences and obtain the semantic roles, and then propose a novel SRRank algorithm and two extensions to make better use of the semantic role information. Our proposed algorithms can simultaneously rank the sentences, semantic roles and words in a heterogeneous ranking process. Experimental results on two DUC datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform a few baselines, and the semantic role information is validated to be very helpful for multidocument summarization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3743","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3743","fieldValue":"ACM"}
