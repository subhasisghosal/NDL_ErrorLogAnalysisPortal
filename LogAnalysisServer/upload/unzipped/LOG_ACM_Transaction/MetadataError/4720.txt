{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25238","fieldValue":" This article reprises the description of the Berkeley software-only MPEG-1 video decoder originally published in the proceedings of the 1st International ACM Conference on Multimedia in 1993. The software subsequently became widely used in a variety of research systems and commercial products. Its main impact was to provide a platform for experimenting with streaming compressed video and to expose the strengths and weaknesses of software-only video decoding using general purpose computing architectures. This article compares the original performance results with experiments run on a modern processor to demonstrate the gains of processing power in the past ten years relative to this specific application and discusses the history of MPEG-1 video software decoding and the Berkeley MPEG research group."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25238","fieldValue":"MPEG"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25238","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25238","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25239","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25239","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25240","fieldValue":"Kum, Sang-Uok"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25240","fieldValue":"Mayer-Patel, Ketan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25240","fieldValue":" The goal of tele-immersion has long been to enable people at remote locations to share a sense of presence. A tele-immersion system acquires the 3D representation of a collaborator's environment remotely and sends it over the network where it is rendered in the user's environment. Acquisition, reconstruction, transmission, and rendering all have to be done in real-time to create a sense of presence. With added commodity hardware resources, parallelism can increase the acquisition volume and reconstruction data quality while maintaining real-time performance. However, this is not as easy for rendering since all of the data need to be combined into a single display.In this article, we present an algorithm to compress data from such 3D environments in real-time to solve this imbalance. We present a compression algorithm which scales comparably to the acquisition and reconstruction, reduces network transmission bandwidth, and reduces the rendering requirement for real-time performance. This is achieved by exploiting the coherence in the 3D environment data and removing them in real-time. We have tested the algorithm using a static office data set as well as a dynamic scene, the results of which are presented in the article."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25240","fieldValue":"ACM"}
