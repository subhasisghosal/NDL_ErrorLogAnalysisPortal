{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15874","fieldValue":" Due to its minimal twist, the rotation minimizing frame (RMF) is widely used in computer graphics, including sweep or blending surface modeling, motion design and control in computer animation and robotics, streamline visualization, and tool path planning in CAD\/CAM. We present a novel simple and efficient method for accurate and stable computation of RMF of a curve in 3D. This method, called the double reflection method, uses two reflections to compute each frame from its preceding one to yield a sequence of frames to approximate an exact RMF. The double reflection method has the fourth order global approximation error, thus it is much more accurate than the two currently prevailing methods with the second order approximation errorâ\u20AC\u201Dthe projection method by Klok and the rotation method by Bloomenthal, while all these methods have nearly the same per-frame computational cost. Furthermore, the double reflection method is much simpler and faster than using the standard fourth order Runge-Kutta method to integrate the defining ODE of the RMF, though they have the same accuracy. We also investigate further properties and extensions of the double reflection method, and discuss the variational principles in design moving frames with boundary conditions, based on RMF."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15874","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15874","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15875","fieldValue":" The standard bilinear interpolation on normal maps results in visual artifacts along sharp features, which are common for surfaces with creases, wrinkles, and dents. In many cases, spatially varying features, like the normals near discontinuity curves, are best represented as functions of the distance to the curve and the position along the curve. For high-quality interactive rendering at arbitrary magnifications, one needs to interpolate the distance field preserving discontinuity curves exactly. We present a real-time, GPU-based method for distance function and distance gradient interpolation which preserves discontinuity feature curves. The feature curves are represented by a set of quadratic Bezier curves, with minimal restrictions on their intersections. We demonstrate how this technique can be used for real-time rendering of complex feature patterns and blending normal maps with procedurally defined profiles near normal discontinuities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15876","fieldValue":" We propose the SOHO wavelet basisâ\u20AC\u201Dthe first spherical Haar wavelet basis that is both orthogonal and symmetric, making it particularly well suited for the approximation and processing of all-frequency signals on the sphere. We obtain the basis with a novel spherical subdivision scheme that defines a partition acting as the domain of the basis functions. Our construction refutes earlier claims doubting the existence of a basis that is both orthogonal and symmetric. Experimental results for the representation of spherical signals verify that the superior theoretical properties of the SOHO wavelet basis are also relevant in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15877","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}
