Service configurations and traffic traces are arbitrary. First, we identify a rich class of throughput-optimal linear controls, which choose the service configuration S maximizing the projection 〈S,BX〉 when the backlog is X. The matrix B is arbitrarily fixed in the class of positive-definite, symmetric matrices with negative or zero off-diagonal elements. In contrast, positive off-diagonal elements may drive the system unstable, even for subcritical loads. The associated rich Euclidian geometry of projective cones is explored (hence the name projective cone scheduling PCS). The maximum-weight-matching (MWM) rule is seen to be a special case, where B is the identity matrix. Second, we extend the class of throughput maximizing controls by identifying a tracking condition which allows applying PCS with any bounded time-lag without compromising throughput. It enables asynchronous or delayed PCS implementations and various examples are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9884","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9884","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9884","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9885","fieldValue":" We formulate a graph model called [w, f]-distributors which is useful in analyzing the structures and comparing the quantitative complexities and qualitative features of optical multicast cross-connects. Using the formulation we show that two strictly nonblocking multicast optical cross-connects under two different request models are equivalent topologically, even though one request model is much less restrictive than the other. We then investigate the tradeoff between the depth and the complexity of an optical multicast cross-connect using the graph model. Upper and lower complexity bounds are proved. In the process, we also give a generic recursive construction that can be used to construct optimal and near-optimal [w, f]-distributors. The recursive construction can also be used to construct cost-effective optical multicast cross-connects. Another important result that follows is the exact asymptotic behavior of the size of optimal [w, f]-connectors, the unicast version of [w, f]-distributors."}
