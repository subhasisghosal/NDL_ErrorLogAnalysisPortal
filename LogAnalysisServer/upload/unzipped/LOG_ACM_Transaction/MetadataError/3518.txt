In this article, we focus on robust range estimation, an important prerequisite for fine-grained localization. Motivated by the promise of acoustic in delivering high ranging accuracy, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of acoustic (both ultrasound and audible) ranging systems. We distill the limitations of acoustic ranging and present efficient signal designs and detection algorithms to overcome the challenges of coverage, range, accuracy\/resolution, tolerance to Doppler's effect, and audible intensity. We evaluate our proposed techniques experimentally on TWEET, a low-power platform purpose-built for acoustic ranging applications. Our experiments demonstrate an operational range of 20m (outdoor) and an average accuracy &ap;2cm in the ultrasound domain. Finally, we present the design of an audible-range acoustic tracking service that encompasses the benefits of a near-inaudible acoustic broadband chirp and approximately two times increase in Doppler tolerance to achieve better performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21465","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21465","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21466","fieldValue":" We describe CTP, a collection routing protocol for wireless sensor networks. CTP uses three techniques to provide efficient, robust, and reliable routing in highly dynamic network conditions. CTP's link estimator accurately estimates link qualities by using feedback from both the data and control planes, using information from multiple layers through narrow, platform-independent interfaces. Second, CTP uses the Trickle algorithm to time the control traffic, sending few beacons in stable topologies yet quickly adapting to changes. Finally, CTP actively probes the topology with data traffic, quickly discovering and fixing routing failures. Through experiments on 13 different testbeds, encompassing seven platforms, six link layers, and multiple densities and frequencies, and detailed observations of a long-running sensor network application that uses CTP, we study how these three techniques contribute to CTP's overall performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21467","fieldValue":"Carreira-Perpin, Miguel "}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21467","fieldValue":"Carreira-Perpin, Miguel "}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21467","fieldValue":"Cerpa, Alberto E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21467","fieldValue":" Modeling the behavior of 802.15.4 links is a nontrivial problem, because 802.15.4 links experience different level of dynamics at short and long time scales. This makes the design of a suitable model that combines the different dynamics at different time scales a nontrivial problem. We propose a novel multilevel approach, the M&M model, involving hidden Markov models (HMMs) and mixtures of multivariate Bernoullis (MMBs) for modeling the long and short time-scale behavior of wireless links from 802.15.4 test beds. We characterize the synthetic traces generated from our model of the wireless link in terms of the mean and variance of the packet reception rates from the data traces, comparison of distributions of run lengths, and conditional packet delivery functions of successive packet receptions (1's) and losses (0's). Our results show that when compared to the closest-fit pattern matching model in TOSSIM, the proposed modeling approach is able to mimic the behavior of the data traces quite closely, with differences in packet reception rates of the empirical and simulated traces of less than 1.9&percnt; on average and 6.6&percnt; in the worst case. Moreover, the simulated links from our proposed approach were able to account for long runs of 1's and 0's as observed in empirical data traces."}
