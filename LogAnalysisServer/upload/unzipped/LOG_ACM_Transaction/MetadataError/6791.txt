{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8143","fieldValue":" This research commentary examines the changing landscape of digital goods, and discusses important emerging issues for IS researchers to explore. We begin with a discussion of the major technological milestones that have shaped digital goods industries such as music, movies, software, books, video games, and recently emerging digital goods. Our emphasis is on economic and legal issues, rather than on design science or sociological issues. We explore how research has been influenced by the major technological milestones and discuss the major findings of prior research. Based on this, we offer a roadmap for future researchers to explore the emergent changes in the digital goods arena, covering different aspects of digital goods industries such as risk management, value chain, legal aspects, transnational and cross-cultural issues."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8143","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8143","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1734","fieldValue":" Software Dynamic Translation (SDT) is used for instrumentation, optimization, security, and many other uses. A major source of SDT overhead is the execution of code to translate an indirect branch's target address into the translated destination block's address. This article discusses sources of Indirect Branch (IB) overhead in SDT systems and evaluates techniques for overhead reduction. Measurements using SPEC CPâ\u20AC\u20AC show that the appropriate choice and configuration of IB translation mechanisms can significantly reduce the overhead. Further, cross-architecture evaluation of these mechanisms reveals that the most efficient implementation and configuration can be highly dependent on the architecture implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1734","fieldValue":"IBTC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8144","fieldValue":" We introduce a novel dataset with a news sentiment index that was constructed from a selection of over 300,000 newspaper articles from five of the top ten U.S. newspapers by circulation. By constructing ARMA models, we show that news and consumer sentiment, when combined with other macroeconomic variables, achieve statistically significant results to explain changes in private consumption. We make three distinct findings with respect to sentiment in consumption behavior models: first, both consumer and news sentiment add explanatory power and statistical significance to conventional consumer behavior models. Second, consumer sentiment, measured by the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment, adds more explanatory power and statistical significance than news sentiment when tested individually. Third, news sentiment is able to determine the signs of all coefficients in the model correctly, whereas consumer sentiment does not. In general, we conclude that news sentiment is a useful variable to add in consumer behavior models, especially when coupled with consumer sentiment and other macroeconomic variables. Tested individually, news sentiment is as good a proxy as personal income for explaining private consumption growth when tested individually."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8144","fieldValue":"ACM"}
