When we apply RBAC model to large enterprises, effective role administration is a major issue. ARBAC97 is a well-known solution for decentralized RBAC administration. ARBAC97 authorizes administrative roles by means of role ranges and prerequisite conditions, where prerequisite conditions effectively work as a restricted pool for administrative roles to pick users or permissions. Although attractive and elegant in their own right, these mechanisms have significant shortcomings. In this paper, we propose an improved role administration model named ARBAC02 to overcome the weaknesses of ARBAC97. ARBAC02 introduces the concept of organization structure for defining user and permission pools independent of roles and role hierarchies, with a refined prerequisite condition specification. In addition, we present a bottom-up approach of permission-role administration in contrast to the top-down approach in ARBAC97. As a general solution, we illustrate the applications of organization structured-based security administration with other access control models, such as access control list model and lattice-based access control model."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22202","fieldValue":"RBAC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22203","fieldValue":" Classical security protocols aim to achieve authentication and confidentiality under the assumption that the peers behave honestly. Some recent protocols are required to achieve their goals even if the peer misbehaves. Accountability is a protocol design strategy that may help. It delivers to peers sufficient evidence of each other's participation in the protocol. Accountability underlies the nonrepudiation protocol of Zhou and Gollmann and the certified email protocol of Abadi et al. This paper provides a comparative, formal analysis of the two protocols, and confirms that they reach their goals under realistic conditions. The treatment, which is conducted with mechanized support from the proof assistant Isabelle, requires various extensions to the existing analysis method. A byproduct is an account of the concept of higher-level protocol."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22203","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22203","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22204","fieldValue":" Minimizing power consumption is crucial in battery power-limited secure wireless mobile networks.

Numerical results are presented to illustrate the gains that can be achieved in using solutions of the proposed security maximization problems subject to power constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22204","fieldValue":"ACM"}
