The basic scheme of [Naor and Pinkas 2000] uses Shamir's polynomial secret-sharing to revoke up to r users, where r is the degree of the secret-sharing polynomial, and it is information theoretically secure against coalitions of up to r collaborators. The nonrevoked users use Lagrange interpolation in order to compute the new key. Our basic scheme uses a novel modification of Shamir's polynomial secret-sharing: The secret equals the leading coefficient of the polynomial (as opposed to the free coefficient as in the original scheme) and the polynomial is reconstructed by Newton interpolation (rather than Lagrange interpolation). Comparing our scheme to one variant of the Naor--Pinkas scheme, we offer revocation messages that are shorter by a factor of almost 2, while the computation cost at the user end is smaller by a constant factor of approximately 13\/2. Comparing to a second variant of the Naor--Pinkas scheme, our scheme offers a reduction of O(r) in the computation cost at the user end, without affecting any of the other performance parameters. We then extend our basic scheme to perform multiround revocation for stateless and stateful receivers, along the lines offered by Naor and Pinkas [2000] and Kogan et al. [2003]. We show that using Newton rather than Lagrange interpolants enables a significantly more efficient transmission of the new revocation message and shorter response time for each round. Pay TV systems that implement broadcast encryption techniques can benefit significantly from the improved efficiency offered by our revocation schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22213","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22213","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3119","fieldValue":" This article introduces a large handwritten text document image corpus dataset for Urdu script named CALAM (Cursive And Language Adaptive Methodologies). The database contains unconstrained handwritten sentences along with their structural annotations for the offline handwritten text images with their XML representation. Urdu is the fourth most frequently used language in the world, but due to its complex cursive writing script and low resources, it is still a thrust area for document image analysis. Here, a unified approach is applied in the development of an Urdu corpus by collecting printed texts, handwritten texts, and demographic information of writers on a single form. CALAM contains 1,200 handwritten text images, 3,043 lines, 46,664 words, and 101,181 ligatures. For capturing maximum variance among the words and handwritten styles, data collection is distributed among six categories and 14 subcategories. Handwritten forms were filled out by 725 different writers belonging to different geographical regions, ages, and genders with diverse educational backgrounds. A structure has been designed to annotate handwritten Urdu script images at line, word, and ligature levels with an XML standard to provide a ground truth of each image at different levels of annotation. This corpus would be very useful for linguistic research in benchmarking and providing a testbed for evaluation of handwritten text recognition techniques for Urdu script, signature verification, writer identification, digital forensics, classification of printed and handwritten text, categorization of texts as per use, and so on. The experimental results of some recently developed handwritten text line segmentation techniques experimented on the proposed dataset are also presented in the article for asserting its viability and usability."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3119","fieldValue":"A Four-Tier Annotated Urdu Handwritten Text Image Dataset for Multidisciplinary Research on Urdu Script"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3119","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3119","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22214","fieldValue":"Ahn, Gail-Joon"}
