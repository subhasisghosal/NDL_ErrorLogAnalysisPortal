In this article, we propose and develop a self-tuning request batching mechanism to simultaneously achieve the two correlated goals. The batching mechanism increases the cache hit rate at the front-tier Web server, which provides the opportunity to improve an applicationâ\u20AC™s performance and the energy efficiency of the server system. The core of the batching mechanism is a novel and practical two-layer control system that adaptively adjusts the batching interval and frequency states of CPUs according to the service level agreement and the workload characteristics. The batching control adopts a self-tuning fuzzy model predictive control approach for application performance improvement. The power control dynamically adjusts the frequency of Central Processing Units (CPUs) with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) in response to workload fluctuations for energy efficiency. A coordinator between the two control loops achieves the desired performance and energy efficiency. We further extend the self-tuning batching with DVFS approach from a single-server system to a multiserver system. It relies on a MIMO expert fuzzy control to adjust the CPU frequencies of multiple servers and coordinate the frequency states of CPUs at different tiers. We implement the mechanism in a test bed. Experimental results demonstrate that the new approach significantly improves the application performance in terms of the system throughput and average response time. At the same time, the results also illustrate the mechanism can reduce the energy consumption of a single-server system by 13&percnt; and a multiserver system by 11&percnt;, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1314","fieldValue":"DVFS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1314","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1314","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4079","fieldValue":" Sensor arrays for audio and speech signal acquisition are generally required to have frequency-invariant beampatterns to avoid adding spectral distortion to the broadband signals of interest. One way to obtain frequency-invariant beampatterns is via superdirective beamforming. However, traditional superdirective beamformers may cause significant white noise amplification (particularly at low frequencies), making them sensitive to uncorrelated white noise. To circumvent the problem of white noise amplification, a method was developed to find the superdirective beamforming filter with a constraint on the white noise gain (WNG), leading to the so-called WNG-constrained superdirective beamformer. But this method damages the frequency invariance of the beampattern. In this paper, we develop a flatness-constrained robust superdirective beamformer. We divide the overall beamformer into two së¯ªmformers, which are convolved together: one së¯ªmformer forms a lower order superdirective beampattern while the other attempts to improve the WNG. We show that this robust approach can improve the WNG while limiting the frequency dependency of the beampattern at the same time."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4079","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4079","fieldValue":"ACM"}
