{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18751","fieldValue":" This paper discusses the design and development of a code to calculate the eigenvalues of a large sparse real unsymmetric matrix that are the rightmost, leftmost, or are of the largest modulus. A subspace iteration algorithm is used to compute a sequence of sets of vectors that converge to an orthonormal basis for the invariant subspace corresponding to the required eigenvalues. This algorithm is combined with Chebychev acceleration if the rightmost or leftmost eigenvalues are sought, or if the eigenvalues of largest modulus are known to be the rightmost or leftmost eigenvalues. An option exists for computing the corresponding eigenvectors. The code does not need the matrix explicitly since it only requires the user to multiply sets of vectors by the matrix. Sophisticated and novel iteration controls, stopping criteria, and restart facilities are provided. The code is shown to be efficient and competitive on a range of test problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18752","fieldValue":" Robust software with error bounds for computing the generalized Schur decomposition of an arbitrary matrix pencil A \u20AC\u201C 位B (regular or singular) is presented. The decomposition is a generalization of the Schur canonical form of A \u20AC\u201C 位I to matrix pencils and reveals the Kronecker structure of a singular pencil. Since computing the Kronecker structure of a singular pencil is a potentially ill-posed problem, it is important to be able to compute rigorous and reliable error bounds for the computed features. The error bounds rely on perturbation theory for reducing subspaces and generalized eigenvalues of singular matrix pencils. The first part of this two-part paper presents the theory and algorithms for the decomposition and its error bounds, while the second part describes the computed generalized Schur decomposition and the software, and presents applications and an example of its use."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18752","fieldValue":"The generalized Schur decomposition of an arbitrary pencil A\u20AC\u201C位B\u20AC\u201Drobust software with error bounds and applications.
