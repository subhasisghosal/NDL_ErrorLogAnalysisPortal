We study the problem of finding potential ancestral gene orders for the gene orders of given taxa, such that the corresponding rearrangement scenario has a minimal number of reversals, and where each of the reversals has to preserve the common intervals of the given input gene orders. Common intervals identify sets of genes that occur consecutively in all input gene orders. The problem of finding such an ancestral gene order is called the preserving reversal median problem (pRMP). A tree-based data structure for the representation of the common intervals of all input gene orders is used in our exact algorithm TCIP for solving the pRMP. It is known that the minimum number of reversals to transform one gene order into another can be computed in polynomial time, whereas the corresponding problem with the restriction that common intervals should not be destroyed is already NP-hard. It is shown theoretically that TCIP can solve a large class of pRMP instances in polynomial time. Empirically we show the good performance of TCIP on biological and artificial data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4365","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4365","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4365","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4366","fieldValue":"Braga, Marlia D V"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4366","fieldValue":"Sagot, Marie-France"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4366","fieldValue":" In comparative genomics, algorithms that sort permutations by reversals are often used to propose evolutionary scenarios of rearrangements between species. One of the main problems of such methods is that they give one solution while the number of optimal solutions is huge, with no criteria to discriminate among them. Bergeron et al. started to give some structure to the set of optimal solutions, in order to be able to deliver more presentable results than only one solution or a complete list of all solutions. However, no algorithm exists so far to compute this structure except through the enumeration of all solutions, which takes too much time even for small permutations. Bergeron et al. state as an open problem the design of such an algorithm. We propose in this paper an answer to this problem, that is, an algorithm which gives all the classes of solutions and counts the number of solutions in each class, with a better theoretical and practical complexity than the complete enumeration method. We give an example of how to reduce the number of classes obtained, using further constraints. Finally, we apply our algorithm to analyse the possible scenarios of rearrangement between mammalian sex chromosomes."}
