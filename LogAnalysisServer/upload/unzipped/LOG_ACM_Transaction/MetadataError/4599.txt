The classical point estimator for such a measure involves simply taking the time average of an appropriate function of the process being simulated. Since the simulation can not be initiated with the (unknown) steady-state distribution, the classical point estimator is generally biased. In the context of regenerative steady-state simulation, a variety of other point estimators have been developed in an attempt to minimize the bias. In this paper, we provide an empirical comparison of these estimators in the context of four different continuous-time Markov chain models. The bias of the point estimators and the coverage probabilities of the associated confidence intervals are reported for the four models. Conclusions are drawn from this experimental work as to which methods are most effective in reducing bias."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24889","fieldValue":"Cheng, R.

One, referred to as simulation variability, arises from the use of random numbers in the simulation itself; and the other, referred to as parameter variability, arises when the input parameters are unknown and have to be estimated from observed data. Three approaches to the calculation of confidence intervals are presented--the traditional asymptotic normality theory approach, a bootstrap approach and a new method which produces a conservative approximation based on performing just two simulation runs at carefully selected parameter settings. It is demonstrated that the traditional and bootstrap approaches provide similar degrees of accuracy and that whilst the new method may sometimes be very conservative, it can be calculated in a small fraction of the computational time of the exact methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/24889","fieldValue":"&delta;-Method"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24889","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24889","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24890","fieldValue":" A simulation algorithm is presented for multi-agent hybrid systems---systems consisting of many sets of nonsmooth differential equations---such as systems involving multiple rigid bodies, vehicles, or airplanes. The differential equations are partitioned into coupled subsystems, called \"agents\"; and the conditions which trigger the discontinuities in the derivatives, called \"events\", may depend on the global state vector. Such systems normally require significant computational resources to simulate because a global time step is used to ensure the discontinuity is properly handled. When the number of systems is large, forcing all system to be simulated at the same rate creates a computational bottleneck, dramatically decreasing efficiency. By using a control systems approach for selecting integration step sizes, we avoid using a global time step. Each subsystem can be simulated asynchronously when the state is away from the event. As the state approaches the event, the simulation is able to synchronize each of the local time clocks in such a way that the discontinuities are properly handled without the need for \"roll back\". The algorithm's operation and utility is demonstrated on an example problem inspired by autonomous highway vehicles. Using a combination of stochastic modelling and numerical experiments we show that the algorithm requires significantly less computation time when compared with traditional simulation techniques for such problems, and scales more favorably with problem size."}
