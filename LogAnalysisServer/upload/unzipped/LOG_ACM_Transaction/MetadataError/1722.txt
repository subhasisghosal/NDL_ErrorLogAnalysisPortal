In this article, we present an exact algorithm for the single-source all-vertices shortest path problem. Mitchell et al. [1987] proposed an $O(n^2 log n) method (MMP), based on Dijkstra's algorithm, where n is the complexity of the polyhedral surface. Then, Chen and Han [1990] (CH) improved the running time to O(n2). Interestingly Surazhsky et al. [2005] provided experimental evidence demonstrating that the MMP algorithm runs many times faster, in practice, than the CH algorithm. The CH algorithm encodes the structure of the set of shortest paths using a set of windows on the edges of the polyhedron. Our experiments showed that in many examples over 99&percnt; of the windows created by the CH algorithm are of no use to define a shortest path. So this article proposes to improve the CH algorithm by two separate techniques. One is to filter out useless windows using the current estimates of the distances to the vertices, the other is to maintain a priority queue like that achieved in Dijkstra's algorithm. Our experimental results suggest that the improved CH algorithm, in spite of an O(n2$ log n) asymptotic time complexity, greatly outperforms the original CH algorithm in both time and space. Furthermore, it generally runs faster than the MMP algorithm and uses considerably less space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16142","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16142","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2530","fieldValue":" We study Nash equilibria in the setting of network creation games introduced recently by Fabrikant, Luthra, Maneva, Papadimitriou, and Shenker. In this game we have a set of selfish node players, each creating some incident links, and the goal is to minimize Î± times the cost of the created links plus sum of the distances to all other players. Fabrikant et al. proved an upper bound O(&sqrt;Î±) on the price of anarchy: the relative cost of the lack of coordination. Albers, Eilts, Even-Dar, Mansour, and Roditty show that the price of anarchy is constant for Î± = O(&sqrt;n) and for Î± &geq; 12 n âŒˆ lg n âŒ\u2030, and that the price of anarchy is $15(1+(min{Î±^2\/n, n2\/Î±})1\/3) for any Î±. The latter bound shows the first sublinear worst-case bound, O(n1\/3), for all Î±. But no better bound is known for Î± between Ï\u2030(&sqrt; n) and o(n lg n). Yet Î± &approx; n is perhaps the most interesting range, for it corresponds to considering the average distance (instead of the sum of distances) to other nodes to be roughly on par with link creation (effectively dividing Î± by n). In this article, we prove the first o(nÎµ) upper bound for general Î±, namely 2O(&sqrt; lg n). We also prove a constant upper bound for Î± = O(n1-Îµ) for any fixed Îµ > 0, substantially reducing the range of Î± for which constant bounds have not been obtained. Along the way, we also improve the constant upper bound by Albers et al. (with the lead constant of 15) to 6 for Î± < (n\/2)1\/2 and to 4 for Î± < (n\/2)1\/3. Next we consider the bilateral network variant of Corbo and Parkes, in which links can be created only with the consent of both endpoints and the link price is shared equally by the two. Corbo and Parkes show an upper bound of O(&sqrt;Î±) and a lower bound of Î©(lgÎ±) for Î± &leq; n. In this article, we show that in fact the upper bound O(&sqrt;Î±) is tight for Î± &leq; n, by proving a matching lower bound of Î©(&sqrt;Î±). For Î± > n, we prove that the price of anarchy is Î˜(n\/&sqrt; Î±). Finally we introduce a variant of both network creation games, in which each player desires to minimize Î± times the cost of its created links plus the maximum distance (instead of the sum of distances) to the other players. This variant of the problem is naturally motivated by considering the worst case instead of the average case. Interestingly, for the original (unilateral) game, we show that the price of anarchy is at most 2 for Î± &geq; n, O(min {4&sqrt;lg n, (n\/Î±)1\/3}) for 2&sqrt; lg n &leq; Î± &leq; n, and O(n2\/Î±$) for Î± < 2&sqrt; lg n. For the bilateral game, we prove matching upper and lower bounds of Î˜(n\/Î± + 1) for Î± &leq; n, and an upper bound of 2 for Î± > n."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16143","fieldValue":"Magnenat-Thalmann, Nadia"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16143","fieldValue":" Recent mechanical models for cloth simulation have evolved toward accurate representation of elastic stiffness based on continuum mechanics, converging to formulations that are largely analogous to fast finite element methods. In the context of tensile deformations, these formulations usually involve the linearization of tensors, so as to express linear elasticity in a simple way. However, this approach needs significant adaptations and approximations for dealing with the nonlinearities resulting from large cloth deformations. Toward our objective of accurately simulating the nonlinear properties of cloth, we show that this linearization can indeed be avoided and replaced by adapted strain-stress laws that precisely describe the nonlinear behavior of the material. This leads to highly streamlined computations that are particularly efficient for simulating the nonlinear anisotropic tensile elasticity of highly deformable surfaces. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method with examples related to accurate garment simulation from experimental tensile curves measured on actual materials."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16143","fieldValue":"ACM"}
