This is achieved using a Dynamic Response Texture, or DyRT, that can be mapped onto any conventional animation as an optional rendering stage using commodity graphics hardware. The DyRT simulation process employs precomputed modal vibration models excited by rigid body motions. We present several examples, with an emphasis on bone-based character animation for interactive applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15254","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15254","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15255","fieldValue":" This paper presents a framework for the skeleton-driven animation of elastically deformable characters. A character is embedded in a coarse volumetric control lattice, which provides the structure needed to apply the finite element method. To incorporate skeletal controls, we introduce line constraints along the bones of simple skeletons. The bones are made to coincide with edges of the control lattice, which enables us to apply the constraints efficiently using algebraic methods. To accelerate computation, we associate regions of the volumetric mesh with particular bones and perform locally linearized simulations, which are blended at each time step. We define a hierarchical basis on the control lattice, so for detailed interactions the simulation can adapt the level of detail. We demonstrate the ability to animate complex models using simple skeletons and coarse volumetric meshes in a manner that simulates secondary motions at interactive rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15255","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15255","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15256","fieldValue":" We present an algorithm to efficiently and robustly process collisions, contact and friction in cloth simulation.
