{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4383","fieldValue":" Pairwise structure alignment commonly uses root mean square deviation (RMSD) to measure the structural similarity, and methods for optimizing RMSD are well established. We extend RMSD to weighted RMSD for multiple structures. By using multiplicative weights, we show that weighted RMSD for all pairs is the same as weighted RMSD to an average of the structures. Thus, using RMSD or weighted RMSD implies that the average is a consensus structure. Although we show that in general, the two tasks of finding the optimal translations and rotations for minimizing weighted RMSD cannot be separated for multiple structures like they can for pairs, an inherent difficulty and a fact ignored by previous work, we develop a near-linear iterative algorithm to converge weighted RMSD to a local minimum. 10,000 experiments of gapped alignment done on each of 23 protein families from HOMSTRAD (where each structure starts with a random translation and rotation) converge rapidly to the same minimum. Finally we propose a heuristic method to iteratively remove the effect of outliers and find well-aligned positions that determine the structural conserved region by modeling B-factors and deviations from the average positions as weights and iteratively assigning higher weights to better aligned atoms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4383","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4383","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4383","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4384","fieldValue":"van den Bedem, Henry"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4384","fieldValue":"Latombe, Jean-Claude"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4384","fieldValue":"Halperin-Landsberg, Inbal"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4384","fieldValue":" Several applications in biology - e.g., incorporation of protein flexibility in ligand docking algorithms, interpretation of fuzzy X-ray crystallographic data, and homology modeling - require computing the internal parameters of a flexible fragment (usually, a loop) of a protein in order to connect its termini to the rest of the protein without causing any steric clash. One must often sample many such conformations in order to explore and adequately represent the conformational range of the studied loop. While sampling must be fast, it is made difficult by the fact that two conflicting constraints - kinematic closure and clash avoidance - must be satisfied concurrently. This paper describes two efficient and complementary sampling algorithms to explore the space of closed clash-free conformations of a flexible protein loop. The \"seed sampling\" algorithm samples broadly from this space, while the \"deformation sampling\" algorithm uses seed conformations as starting points to explore the conformation space around them at a finer grain. Computational results are presented for various loops ranging from 5 to 25 residues. More specific results also show that the combination of the sampling algorithms with a functional site prediction software (FEATURE) makes it possible to compute and recognize calcium-binding loop conformations. The sampling algorithms are implemented in a toolkit (LoopTK), which is available at https:\/\/simtk.org\/home\/looptk."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4384","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4384","fieldValue":"ACM"}
