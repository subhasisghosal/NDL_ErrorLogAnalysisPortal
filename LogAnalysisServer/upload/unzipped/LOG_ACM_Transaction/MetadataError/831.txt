To reduce the cost, Design-For-Test techniques (DFT) such as Built-In Self-Test (BIST) have been developed. For a given Circuit Under Test (CUT), the choice of a suitable technique should be made at the design stage as a result of the analysis of test metrics such as test escapes and yield loss. However, it is very hard to carry out this estimation for analog\/RF circuits by using fault simulation techniques. Instead, the estimation of parametric test metrics is made possible by Monte Carlo circuit-level simulations and the construction of statistical models. These models represent the output parameter space of the CUT in which the test metrics are defined. In addition, models of the input parameter space may be required to accelerate the simulations and obtain higher confidence in the DFT choices. In this work, we describe a methodological flow for the selection of most adequate statistical models and several techniques that can be used for obtaining these models. Some of these techniques have been integrated into a Computer-Aided Test (CAT) tool for the automation of the process of test metrics estimation. This estimation is illustrated for the case of a BIST solution for CMOS imager pixels that requires the use of advanced statistical modeling techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13428","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13428","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13429","fieldValue":" As the size and density of silicon chips continue to increase, maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields has become increasingly difficult. Recent works suggest that lithography techniques are reaching their limits with respect to enabling high yield fabrication of small-scale devices, thus there is an increasing need for techniques that can tolerate fabrication time defects. One candidate technology to help combat these defects is reconfigurable hardware. The flexible nature of reconfigurable devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), makes it possible for them to route around defective areas of a chip after the device has been packaged and deployed into the field. This work presents a technique that aims to increase the effective yield of FPGA manufacturing by re-claiming a portion of chips that would be ordinarily classified as unusable. In brief, we propose a modification to existing commercial toolchain flows to make them fault aware. A phase is added to identify faults within the chip. The locations of these faults are then used by the toolchain to avoid faults during the placement and routing phase. Specifically, we have applied our approach to the Xilinx commercial toolchain flow and evaluated its tolerance to both logic and routing resource faults. Our findings show that, at a cost of 5--10&percnt; in device frequency performance, the modified toolchain flow can tolerate up to 30&percnt; of logic resources being faulty and, depending on the nature of the target application, can tolerate 1--30&percnt; of the device's routing resources being faulty. These results provide strong evidence that commercial toolchains not designed for the purpose of tolerating faults can still be greatly leveraged in the presence of faults to place and route circuits in an efficient manner."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13429","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13429","fieldValue":"ACM"}
