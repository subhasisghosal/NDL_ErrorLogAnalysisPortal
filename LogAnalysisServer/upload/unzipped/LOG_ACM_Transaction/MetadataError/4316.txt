We evaluate whether recent improvements indesktop search have changed this fundamental aspect of PersonalInformation Management (PIM). We tested this in two studies usingthe same questionnaire: (a) The Windows Studya longitudinalcomparison of Google Desktop and Windows XP SearchCompanion, and (b) The Mac Studya large scale comparison of MacSpotlight and Sherlock. There were few effects forimproved search. First, regardless of search engine, there was astrong navigation preference: on average, users estimated that theyused navigation for 56-68% of file retrieval events but searchedfor only 4-15% of events. Second, the effect of improving thequality of the search engine on search usage was limited andinconsistent. Third, search was used mainly as a last resort whenusers could not remember file location. Finally, there was noevidence that using improved desktop search engines leads people tochange their filing habits to become less reliant on hierarchicalfile organization. We conclude by offering theoretical explanationsfor navigation preference, relating to differences between PIM andInternet retrieval, and suggest alternative design directions forPIM systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23967","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23967","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23968","fieldValue":" Human memory plays an important role in personal information management (PIM). Several scholars have noted that people refind information based on what they remember and it has been shown that people adapt their management strategies to compensate for the limitations of memory. Nevertheless, little is known about what people tend to remember about their personal information and how they use their memories to refind. The aim of this article is to increase our understanding of the role that memory plays in the process of refinding personal information. Concentrating on email re-finding, we report on a user study that investigates what attributes of email messages participants remember when trying to refind. We look at how the attributes change in different scenarios and examine the factors which impact on what is remembered."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23968","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23968","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23969","fieldValue":" This article introduces a methodology for automatically organizing document collections into thematic categories for Personal Information Management (PIM) through collaborative sharing of machine learning models in an efficient and privacy-preserving way. Our objective is to combine multiple independently learned models from several users to construct an advanced ensemble-based decision model by taking the knowledge of multiple users into account in a decentralized manner, for example, in a peer-to-peer overlay network. High accuracy of the corresponding supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) methods is achieved by restrictively leaving out uncertain documents rather than assigning them to inappropriate topics or clusters with low confidence. We introduce a formal probabilistic model for the resulting ensemble based meta methods and explain how it can be used for constructing estimators and for goal-oriented tuning. Comprehensive evaluation results on different reference data sets illustrate the viability of our approach."}
