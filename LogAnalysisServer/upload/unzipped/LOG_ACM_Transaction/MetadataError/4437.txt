Leaving the burden of location\/context management to applications complicates service design and development. In addition, traditional middleware solutions tend to hide location\/context visibility to the application level and are not suitable for supporting novel adaptive services for mobile computing scenarios. The article proposes a flexible middleware for the development and deployment of location\/context-aware services for heterogeneous data access in the Internet. A primary design choice is to exploit a high-level policy framework to simplify the specification of services that the middleware dynamically adapts to the client location\/context. In addition, the middleware adopts the mobile agent technology to effectively support autonomous, asynchronous, and local access to data resources, and is particularly suitable for temporarily disconnected clients. The article also presents the case study of a museum guide assistant service that provides visitors with location\/context-dependent artistic data. The case study points out the flexibility and usability of the proposed middleware that permits automatic service reconfiguration with no impact on the implementation of the application logic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24341","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a new approach to page ranking. The page rank of a collection of Web pages can be represented in a parameterized model, and the user requirements can be represented by a set of constraints. For a particular parameterization, namely, a linear combination of the page ranks produced by different forcing functions, and user requirements represented by a set of linear constraints, the problem can be solved using a quadratic programming method. The solution to this problem produces a set of parameters which can be used for ranking all pages in the Web. We show that the method is suitable for building customized versions of PageRank which can be readily adapted to the needs of a vertical search engine or that of a single user."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24341","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24341","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24342","fieldValue":"Hui, Kai-Lung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24342","fieldValue":"Tan, Bernard C Y"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24342","fieldValue":"Goh, Chyan-Yee"}
