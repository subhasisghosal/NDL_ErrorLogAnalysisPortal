Recently, object motion information is being used in various applications, and the types of targets that can be sensed continue to diversify. Nevertheless, conventional motion sensing systems have low universality because they require some devices to be mounted on the target, such as accelerometers and gyro sensors, or because they are based on cameras, which limits the types of targets that can be detected. Our method solves this problem and enables noncontact, high-speed, deterministic measurement of the velocity of a moving target without any prior knowledge about the target shape and texture, and can be applied to any unconstrained, unspecified target. These distinctive features are achieved by using a system consisting of a laser range finder, a laser Doppler velocimeter, and a beam controller, in addition to a robust 3D motion calculation method. The motion of the target is recovered from fragmentary physical information, such as the distance and speed of the target at the laser irradiation points. From the acquired laser information, our method can provide a numerically stable solution based on the generalized weighted Tikhonov regularization. Using this technique and a prototype system that we developed, we also demonstrated a number of applications, including motion capture, video game control, and 3D shape integration with everyday objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17454","fieldValue":"LDV"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17454","fieldValue":"TOF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17455","fieldValue":"Hsu, Chen-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17455","fieldValue":" We present RF-Capture, a system that captures the human figure -- i.e., a coarse skeleton -- through a wall. RF-Capture tracks the 3D positions of a person's limbs and body parts even when the person is fully occluded from its sensor, and does so without placing any markers on the subject's body. In designing RF-Capture, we built on recent advances in wireless research, which have shown that certain radio frequency (RF) signals can traverse walls and reflect off the human body, allowing for the detection of human motion through walls. In contrast to these past systems which abstract the entire human body as a single point and find the overall location of that point through walls, we show how we can reconstruct various human body parts and stitch them together to capture the human figure. We built a prototype of RF-Capture and tested it on 15 subjects. Our results show that the system can capture a representative human figure through walls and use it to distinguish between various users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17455","fieldValue":"ACM"}
