{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16842","fieldValue":" We present a formulation of Willmore flow for triangulated surfaces that permits extraordinarily large time steps and naturally preserves the quality of the input mesh. The main insight is that Willmore flow becomes remarkably stable when expressed in curvature space -- we develop the precise conditions under which curvature is allowed to evolve. The practical outcome is a highly efficient algorithm that naturally preserves texture and does not require remeshing during the flow. We apply this algorithm to surface fairing, geometric modeling, and construction of constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces. We also present a new algorithm for length-preserving flow on planar curves, which provides a valuable analogy for the surface case."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16842","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16842","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16843","fieldValue":" We present a new subspace integration method that is capable of efficiently adding and subtracting dynamics from an existing high-resolution fluid simulation. We show how to analyze the results of an existing high-resolution simulation, discover an efficient reduced approximation, and use it to quickly \"re-simulate\" novel variations of the original dynamics. Prior subspace methods have had difficulty re-simulating the original input dynamics because they lack efficient means of handling semi-Lagrangian advection methods. We show that multi-dimensional cubature schemes can be applied to this and other advection methods, such as MacCormack advection. The remaining pressure and diffusion stages can be written as a single matrix-vector multiply, so as with previous subspace methods, no matrix inversion is needed at runtime. We additionally propose a novel importance sampling-based fitting algorithm that asymptotically accelerates the precomputation stage, and show that the Iterated Orthogonal Projection method can be used to elegantly incorporate moving internal boundaries into a subspace simulation. In addition to efficiently producing variations of the original input, our method can produce novel, abstract fluid motions that we have not seen from any other solver."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16843","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16843","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16844","fieldValue":" We present an efficient grid structure that extends a uniform grid to create a significantly larger far-field grid by dynamically extending the cells surrounding a fine uniform grid while still maintaining fine resolution about the regions of interest. The far-field grid preserves almost every computational advantage of uniform grids including cache coherency, regular subdivisions for parallelization, simple data layout, the existence of efficient numerical discretizations and algorithms for solving partial differential equations, etc. This allows fluid simulations to cover large domains that are often infeasible to enclose with sufficient resolution using a uniform grid, while still effectively capturing fine scale details in regions of interest using dynamic adaptivity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16844","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16844","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16845","fieldValue":" We present an algorithm for denoising triangulated models based on $L_0$ minimization. Our method maximizes the flat regions of the model and gradually removes noise while preserving sharp features. As part of this process, we build a discrete differential operator for arbitrary triangle meshes that is robust with respect to degenerate triangulations. We compare our method versus other anisotropic denoising algorithms and demonstrate that our method is more robust and produces good results even in the presence of high noise."}
