However, two major obstacles pose an existential threat to practical deployment of such techniques: the exponential growth of decoding complexity with network size and coding rates and the critical requirement of resilience to bit errors and erasures, given the severe channel conditions in many wireless sensor network applications. This article proposes a novel, unified approach for large-scale, error\/erasure-resilient DSC that incorporates an optimally designed, nearest neighbor classifier-based decoding framework, where the design explicitly controls performance versus decoding complexity. Motivated by the highly nonconvex nature of the cost function, we present a deterministic annealing-based optimization algorithm for the joint design of the system parameters, which further enhances the performance over the greedy iterative descent technique. Simulation results on both synthetic and real sensor network data provide strong evidence for performance gains compared to other state-of-the-art techniques and may open the door to practical deployment of DSC in large sensor networks. Moreover, the framework provides a principled way to naturally scale to large networks while constraining decoder complexity, thereby enabling performance gains that increase with network size."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21567","fieldValue":"Error\/Erasure-Resilient and Complexity-Constrained Zero-Delay Distributed Coding for Large-Scale Sensor Networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21567","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21567","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21568","fieldValue":"Pinotti, Cristina M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21568","fieldValue":" We investigate the condition on transmission radius needed to achieve connectivity in duty-cycled wireless sensor networks (briefly, DC-WSNs). First, we settle a conjecture of Das et al. [2012] and prove that the connectivity condition on random geometric graphs (RGGs), given by Gupta and Kumar [1989], can be used to derive a weakly sufficient condition to achieve connectivity in DC-WSNs. To find a stronger result, we define a new vertex-based random connection model that is of independent interest. Following a proof technique of Penrose [1991], we prove that when the density of the nodes approaches infinity, then a finite component of size greater than 1 exists with probability 0 in this model. We use this result to obtain an optimal condition on node transmission radius that is both necessary and sufficient to achieve connectivity and is hence optimal. The optimality of such a radius is also tested via simulation for two specific duty-cycle schemes, called the contiguous and the random selection duty-cycle schemes. Finally, we design a minimum-radius duty-cycling scheme that achieves connectivity with a transmission radius arbitrarily close to the one required in random geometric graphs. The overhead in this case is that we have to spend some time computing the schedule."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21568","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21568","fieldValue":"ACM"}
