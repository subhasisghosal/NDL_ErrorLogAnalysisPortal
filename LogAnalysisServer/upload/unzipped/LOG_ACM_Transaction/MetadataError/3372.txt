Medical record databases, large biomedical datasets, historical information about power systems and financial data are some examples of critical data that could be moved to the cloud. However, the reliability and security of data stored in the cloud still remain major concerns. In this work we present DepSky, a system that improves the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of information stored in the cloud through the encryption, encoding, and replication of the data on diverse clouds that form a cloud-of-clouds. We deployed our system using four commercial clouds and used PlanetLab to run clients accessing the service from different countries. We observed that our protocols improved the perceived availability, and in most cases, the access latency, when compared with cloud providers individually. Moreover, the monetary costs of using DepSky in this scenario is at most twice the cost of using a single cloud, which is optimal and seems to be a reasonable cost, given the benefits."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21045","fieldValue":"Cho, Hyung-Ju"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21045","fieldValue":"Chung, Tae-Sun"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21045","fieldValue":" Flash memory is used widely in the data storage market, particularly low-price MultiLevel Cell (MLC) flash memory, which has been adopted by large-scale storage systems despite its low performance. To overcome the poor performance of MLC flash memory, a system architecture has been designed to optimize chip-level parallelism. This design increases the size of the page unit and the block unit, thereby simultaneously executing operations on multiple chips. Unfortunately, its Flash Translation Layer (FTL) generates many unused sectors in each page, which leads to unnecessary write operations. Furthermore, it reuses an earlier log block scheme, although it generates many erase operations because of its low space utilization. To solve these problems, we propose a hybrid associative FTL (Hybrid-FTL) to enhance the performance of the chip-level parallel flash memory system. Hybrid-FTL reduces the number of write operations by utilizing all of the unused sectors. Furthermore, it reduces the overall number of erase operations by classifying data as hot, cold, or fragment data. Hybrid-FTL requires less mapping information in the DRAM and in the flash memory compared with previous FTL algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21045","fieldValue":"Hybrid Associative Flash Translation Layer for the Performance Optimization of Chip-Level Parallel Flash Memory"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21045","fieldValue":"ACM"}
