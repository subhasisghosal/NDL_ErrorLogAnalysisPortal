In this paper, we propose a multi-objective, multi-state optimization framework that allows multiple data sources to be incorporated into the parameter estimation process. This enables the model to better represent a diverse range of data from both within and outwith the training set; and to determine more biologically relevant parameter values for the model parameters. The framework is based on a multi-objective PSwarm implementation (MoPSwarm) and is validated via a case study on the ERK signalling pathway, in which significant advantages over the conventional single-state approach are demonstrated. Several variants of the framework are analyzed to determine the optimal configuration for convergence and solution quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5323","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5323","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5324","fieldValue":" It is challenging to obtain reliable and optimal mapping between networks for alignment algorithms when both nodal and topological structures are taken into consideration due to the underlying NP-hard problem. Here, we introduce an adaptive hybrid algorithm that combines the classical Hungarian algorithm and the Greedy algorithm (HGA) for the global alignment of biomolecular networks. With this hybrid algorithm, every pair of nodes with one in each network is first aligned based on node information (e.g., their sequence attributes) and then followed by an adaptive and convergent iteration procedure for aligning the topological connections in the networks. For four well-studied protein interaction networks, i.e., C.elegans, yeast, D.melanogaster, and human, applications of HGA lead to improved alignments in acceptable running time. The mapping between yeast and human PINs obtained by the new algorithm has the largest value of common gene ontology (GO) terms compared to those obtained by other existing algorithms, while it still has lower Mean normalized entropy (MNE) and good performances on several other measures. Overall, the adaptive HGA is effective and capable of providing good mappings between aligned networks in which the biological properties of both the nodes and the connections are important."}
