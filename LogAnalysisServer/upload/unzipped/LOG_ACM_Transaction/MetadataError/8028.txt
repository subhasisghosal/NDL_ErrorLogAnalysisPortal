One of them, called multigroup threshold-based classification, is the focus of this paper. It is to determine whether the number of objects in each group is above or below a prescribed threshold value. Solving this problem is important for inventory tracking applications. If the number of groups is very large, it will be inefficient to measure the groups one at a time. The best existing solution for multigroup threshold-based classification is based on generic group testing, whose design is however geared toward detecting a small number of populous groups. Its performance degrades quickly when the number of groups above the threshold becomes large. In this paper, we propose a new classification protocol based on tag sampling and logical bitmaps. It achieves high efficiency by measuring all groups in a mixed fashion. In the meantime, we show that the new method is able to perform threshold-based classification with an accuracy that can be preset to any desirable level, allowing tradeoff between time efficiency and accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10876","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10876","fieldValue":"An efficient protocol for rfid multigroup threshold-based classification based on sampling and logical bitmap"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10877","fieldValue":" This paper studies the problem of detecting the information source in a network in which the spread of information follows the popular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. We assume all nodes in the network are in the susceptible state initially, except one single information source that is in the infected state. Susceptible nodes may then be infected by infected nodes, and infected nodes may recover and will not be infected again after recovery. Given a snapshot of the network, from which we know the graph topology and all infected nodes but cannot distinguish susceptible nodes and recovered nodes, the problem is to find the information source based on the snapshot and the network topology. We develop a sample-path-based approach where the estimator of the information source is chosen to be the root node associated with the sample path that most likely leads to the observed snapshot. We prove for infinite-trees, the estimator is a node that minimizes the maximum distance to the infected nodes. A reverse-infection algorithm is proposed to find such an estimator in general graphs. We prove that for g + 1-regular trees such that gq > 1, where g + 1 is the node degree and is the infection probability, the estimator is within a constant distance from the actual source with a high probability, independent of the number of infected nodes and the time the snapshot is taken. Our simulation results show that for tree networks, the estimator produced by the reverse-infection algorithm is closer to the actual source than the one identified by the closeness centrality heuristic. We then further evaluate the performance of the reverse infection algorithm on several real-world networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10877","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10877","fieldValue":"ACM"}
