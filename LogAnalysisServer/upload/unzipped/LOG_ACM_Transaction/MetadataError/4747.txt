Research effort in this area has been focused on semantic event detection in sports video to facilitate accessing and browsing. Most of the event detection methods in sports video are based on visual features. However, being a significant component of sports video, audio may also play an important role in semantic event detection. In this paper, we have borrowed the concept of the â\u20ACœkeywordâ\u20AC? from the text mining domain to define a set of specific audio sounds. These specific audio sounds refer to a set of game-specific sounds with strong relationships to the actions of players, referees, commentators, and audience, which are the reference points for interesting sports events. Unlike low-level features, audio keywords can be considered as a mid-level representation, able to facilitate high-level analysis from the semantic concept point of view. Audio keywords are created from low-level audio features with learning by support vector machines. With the help of video shots, the created audio keywords can be used to detect semantic events in sports video by Hidden Markov Model (HMM) learning. Experiments on creating audio keywords and, subsequently, event detection based on audio keywords have been very encouraging. Based on the experimental results, we believe that the audio keyword is an effective representation that is able to achieve satisfying results for event detection in sports video. Application in three sports types demonstrates the practicality of the proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25307","fieldValue":"Cheung, Sen-ching"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25307","fieldValue":" In recent years, multimedia applications over the Internet become increasingly popular. However, packet loss, delay, and time-varying bandwidth of the Internet have remained the major problems for multimedia streaming applications. As such, a number of approaches, including network infrastructure and protocol, source and channel coding, have been proposed to either overcome or alleviate these drawbacks of the Internet. In this article, we propose the MultiTCP system, a receiver-driven, TCP-based system for multimedia streaming over the Internet. Our proposed algorithm aims at providing resilience against short term insufficient bandwidth by using multiple TCP connections for the same application. Our proposed system enables the application to achieve and control the desired sending rate during congested periods, which cannot be achieved using traditional TCP. Finally, our proposed system is implemented at the application layer, and hence, no kernel modification to TCP is necessary. We analyze the proposed system, and present simulation and experimental results to demonstrate its advantages over the traditional single-TCP-based approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25308","fieldValue":"Chen, Yi-Ping Phoebe"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25308","fieldValue":" Sport video data is growing rapidly as a result of the maturing digital technologies that support digital video capture, faster data processing, and large storage. However, (1) semi-automatic content extraction and annotation, (2) scalable indexing model, and (3) effective retrieval and browsing, still pose the most challenging problems for maximizing the usage of large video databases. This article will present the findings from a comprehensive work that proposes a scalable and extensible sports video retrieval system with two major contributions in the area of sports video indexing and retrieval. The first contribution is a new sports video indexing model that utilizes semi-schema-based indexing scheme on top of an Object-Relationship approach. This indexing model is scalable and extensible as it enables gradual index construction which is supported by ongoing development of future content extraction algorithms. The second contribution is a set of novel queries which are based on XQuery to generate dynamic and user-oriented summaries and event structures. The proposed sports video retrieval system has been fully implemented and populated with soccer, tennis, swimming, and diving video. The system has been evaluated against 20 users to demonstrate and confirm its feasibility and benefits. The experimental sports genres were specifically selected to represent the four main categories of sports domain: period-, set-point-, time (race)-, and performance-based sports. Thus, the proposed system should be generic and robust for all types of sports."}
