To this end, we go back to Curien's original calculus of closures (an early calculus with explicit substitutions), we extend it minimally so that it can also express one-step reduction strategies, and we methodically derive a series of environment machines from the specification of two one-step reduction strategies for the lambda-calculus: normal order and applicative order. The derivation extends Danvy and Nielsen's refocusing-based construction of abstract machines with two new steps: one for coalescing two successive transitions into one, and the other for unfolding a closure into a term and an environment in the resulting abstract machine. The resulting environment machines include both the Krivine machine and the original version of Krivine's machine, Felleisen et al.'s CEK machine, and Leroy's Zinc abstract machine."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11511","fieldValue":" The development of effective knowledge discovery techniques has become a very active research area in recent years due to the important impact it has had in several relevant application domains. One interesting task therein is that of singling out anomalous individuals from a given population, for example, to detect rare events in time-series analysis settings, or to identify objects whose behavior is deviant w.r.t. a codified standard set of rules. Such exceptional individuals are usually referred to as outliers in the literature. In this article, the concept of outlier is formally stated in the context of knowledge-based systems, by generalizing that originally proposed in Angiulli et al. [2003] in the context of default theories. The chosen formal framework here is that of logic programming, wherein potential applications of techniques for outlier detection are thoroughly discussed. The proposed formalization is a novel one and helps to shed light on the nature of outliers occurring in logic bases. Also the exploitation of minimality criteria in outlier detection is illustrated. The computational complexity of outlier detection problems arising in this novel setting is also thoroughly investigated and accounted for in the paper. Finally, rewriting algorithms are proposed that transform any outlier detection problem into an equivalent inference problem under stable model semantics, thereby making outlier computation effective and realizable on top of any stable model solver."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11512","fieldValue":" We define a general notion of a fragment within higher-order type theory; a procedure for constraint satisfiability in combined fragments is outlined, following Nelson-Oppen schema. The procedure is in general only sound, but it becomes terminating and complete when the shared fragment enjoys suitable noetherianity conditions and admits an abstract version of a â\u20ACœKeisler-Shelah-likeâ\u20AC? isomorphism theorem. We show that this general decidability transfer result covers recent work on combination in first-order theories as well as in various intensional logics such as description, modal, and temporal logics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11512","fieldValue":"ACM"}
