The analysis of DPS is extremely challenging, and analytical results are scarce. We develop closed-form approximations for the mean conditional (on the service requirement) and unconditional sojourn times. The main benefits of the approximations lie in its simplicity, the fact that it applies for general service requirements with finite second moments, and that it provides insights into the dependency of the performance on the system parameters. We show that the approximation for the mean conditional and unconditional sojourn time of a customer is decreasing as its relative priority increases. We also show that the approximation is exact in various scenarios, and that it is uniformly bounded in the second moments of the service requirements. Finally, we numerically illustrate that the approximation for exponential, hyperexponential, and Pareto service requirements is accurate across a broad range of parameters."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17767","fieldValue":" We introduce the EP queue -- a significant generalization of the $M^B$\/G\/1 queue that has state-dependent service time probability distributions and incorporates power-up for first arrivals and power-down for idle periods. We derive exact results for the busy-time and response-time distributions. From these, we derive power consumption metrics during nonidle periods and overall response time metrics, which together provide a single measure of the trade-off between energy and performance. We illustrate these trade-offs for some policies and show how numerical results can provide insights into system behavior. The EP queue has application to storage systems, especially hard disks, and other data-center components such as compute servers, networking, and even hyperconverged infrastructure."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17767","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17767","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17768","fieldValue":"Sarbazi-Azad, Hamid"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17768","fieldValue":" Solid-state drives (SSDs) with tens of NAND flash chips and highly parallel architectures are widely used in enterprise and client storage systems. As any write operation in NAND flash is preceded by a slow erase operation, an out-of-place update mechanism is used to distribute writes through SSD storage space to postpone erase operations as far as possible. SSD controllers use a mapping table along with a specific allocation strategy to map logical host addresses to physical page addresses within storage space. The allocation strategy is further responsible for accelerating I\/O operations through better striping of physical addresses over SSD parallel resources. Proposals already exist for using static logical-to-physical address mapping that does not balance the I\/O traffic load within the SSD, and its efficiency highly depends on access patterns. A more balanced distribution of I\/O operations is to alternate resource allocation in a round-robin manner irrespective of logical addresses. The number of resources that can be dynamically allocated in this fashion is defined as the degree of freedom, and to the best of our knowledge, there has been no research thus far to show what happens if different degrees of freedom are used in allocation strategy. This article explores the possibility of using dynamic resource allocation and identifies key design opportunities that it presents to improve SSD performance. Specifically, using steady-state analysis of SSDs, we show that dynamism helps to mitigate performance and endurance overheads of garbage collection. Our steady-state experiments indicate that midrange\/high-end SSDs with dynamic allocation can provide I\/O operations per second (IOPS) improvement of up to 3.3x\/9.6x, response time improvement of up to 56&percnt;\/32&percnt;, and about 88&percnt;\/96&percnt; average reduction in the standard deviation of erase counts of NAND flash blocks."}
