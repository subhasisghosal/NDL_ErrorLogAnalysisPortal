The stretch caused by a given parameterization determines the sampling rate on the surface. In this article, we present an automatic parameterization method for segmenting a surface into patches that are then flattened with little stretch. Many objects consist of regions of relatively simple shapes, each of which has a natural parameterization. Based on this observation, we describe a three-stage feature-based patch creation method for manifold surfaces. The first two stages, genus reduction and feature identification, are performed with the help of distance-based surface functions. In the last stage, we create one or two patches for each feature region based on a covariance matrix of the feature's surface points. To reduce stretch during patch unfolding, we notice that stretch is a 2 Ã\u2014 2 tensor, which in ideal situations is the identity. Therefore, we use the Green-Lagrange tensor to measure and to guide the optimization process. Furthermore, we allow the boundary vertices of a patch to be optimized by adding scaffold triangles. We demonstrate our feature-based patch creation and patch unfolding methods for several textured models. Finally, to evaluate the quality of a given parameterization, we describe an image-based error measure that takes into account stretch, seams, smoothness, packing efficiency, and surface visibility."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15496","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a subdivision scheme for mixed triangle\/quad meshes that is $C^2 everywhere except for isolated, extraordinary points. The rules that we describe are the same as Stam and Loop's scheme [2003] except that we perform an unzipping pass prior to subdivision. This simple modification improves the smoothness along the ordinary triangle\/quad boundary from C1 to C2, and creates a scheme capable of subdividing arbitrary meshes. Finally, we end with a proof based on Levin and Levin's [2003] joint spectral radius calculation to show our scheme is indeed C2$ along the triangle\/quad boundary."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15497","fieldValue":"Baranoski, Gladimir V G"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15497","fieldValue":" Simulating natural phenomena has always been a focal point for computer graphics research. Its importance goes beyond the production of appealing presentations, since research in this area can contribute to the scientific understanding of complex natural processes. The natural phenomena, known as the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis, are geomagnetic phenomena of impressive visual characteristics and remarkable scientific interest. Aurorae present a complex behavior that arises from interactions between plasma (hot, ionized gases composed of ions, electrons, and neutral atoms) and Earth's electromagnetic fields. Previous work on the visual simulation of auroral phenomena have focused on static physical models of their shape, modeled from primitives, like sine waves. In this article, we focus on the dynamic behavior of the aurora, and we present a physically-based model to perform 3D visual simulations. The model takes into account the physical parameters and processes directly associated with plasma flow, and can be extended to simulate the dynamics of other plasma phenomena as well as astrophysical phenomena. The partial differential equations associated with these processes are solved using a complete multigrid implementation of the electromagnetic interactions, leading to a simulation of the shape and motion of the auroral displays. In order to illustrate the applicability of our model, we provide simulation sequences rendered using a distributed forward mapping approach."}
