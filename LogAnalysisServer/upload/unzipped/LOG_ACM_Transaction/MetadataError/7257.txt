Without modifying the TCP congestion control based on the additive-increase\/multiplicative-decrease paradigm, TCP-SF adopts a novel segmentation algorithm: while Classic TCP always tries to send full-sized segments, a TCP-SF source adopts a more flexible segmentation algorithm to try and always have a number of in-flight segments larger than 3 so as to enable Fast Recovery. We motivate this choice by real traffic measurements, which indicate that today's traffic is populated by short-lived flows, whose only means to recover from a packet loss is by triggering a Retransmission Timeout. The key idea of TCP-SF can be implemented on top of any TCP flavor, from Tahoe to SACK, and requires modifications to the server TCP stack only, and can be easily coupled with recent TCP enhancements.The performance of the proposed TCP modification were studied by means of simulations, live measurements and an analytical model. In addition, the analytical model we have devised has a general scope, making it a valid tool for TCP performance evaluation in the small window region. Improvements are remarkable under several buffer management schemes, and maximized by byte-oriented schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9332","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9333","fieldValue":" This work presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for memoryless window-based congestion control protocols that are designed to converge to fairness and efficiency. We first derive a necessary and sufficient condition for stepwise convergence to fairness. Using this, we show how fair window increase\/decrease policies can be constructed from suitable pairs of monotonically nondecreasing functions. We generalize this to smooth protocols that converge over each congestion epoch. The framework also includes a simple method for incorporating TCP-friendliness.Well-studied congestion control protocols such as TCP, GAIMD, and Binomial congestion control can be constructed using this method. Thus, we provide a common framework for the analysis of such window-based protocols. We also present two new congestion control protocols for streaming media-like applications as examples of protocol design in this framework: The first protocol, LOG, has the objective of reconciling the smoothness requirement of an application with the need for a fast dynamic response to congestion.The second protocol, SIGMOID, guarantees a minimum bandwidth for an application but behaves exactly like TCP for large windows."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9333","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9333","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9333","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9334","fieldValue":"Kwak, Byung-Jae"}
