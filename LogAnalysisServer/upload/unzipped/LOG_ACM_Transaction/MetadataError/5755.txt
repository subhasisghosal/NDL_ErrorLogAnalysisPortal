More recently, analytical jobs are benefitting from on-demand computing and storage, their scalability and their low maintenance cost, all of which are offered by the cloud. While biologists and bioinformaticists can take an analytical job and execute it on their personal workstations, it remains challenging to seamlessly execute the job on the cloud infrastructure without extensive knowledge of the cloud dashboard. How analytical jobs can not only with minimum effort be executed on the cloud, but also how both the resources and data required by the job can be managed is explored in this paper. An open-source light-weight framework for executing R-scripts using Bioconductor packages, referred to as 'RBioCloud', is designed and developed. RBioCloud offers a set of simple command-line tools for managing the cloud resources, the data and the execution of the job. Three biological test cases validate the feasibility of RBioCloud.

Many graph computational algorithms have been proposed to identify protein complexes from PPI networks by detecting densely connected groups of proteins. These algorithms assess the density of subgraphs through evaluation of the sum of individual edges or nodes; thus, incomplete and inaccurate measures may miss meaningful biological protein complexes with functional significance. In this study, we propose a novel method for assessing the compactness of local subnetworks by measuring the number of three node cliques. The present method detects each optimal cluster by growing a seed and maximizing the compactness function. To demonstrate the efficacy of the new proposed method, we evaluate its performance using five PPI networks on three reference sets of yeast protein complexes with five different measurements and compare the performance of the proposed method with four state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the protein complexes generated by the proposed method are of better quality than those generated by four classic methods. Therefore, the new proposed method is effective and useful for detecting protein complexes in PPI networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5220","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5221","fieldValue":"Wong, Hau-San"}
