To create an automated face-recognition system, the fundamental challenge is that of finding useful features. In this paper, we suggest a new class of image features that may be a useful addition to the set of representational tools for face-recognition tasks. Our proposal is motivated by the observation that rather than relying exclusively on traditional edge-based image representations, it may be useful to also employ region-based strategies that can compare noncontiguous image regions. The spatial homogeneity within regions allows for enhanced tolerance to geometric distortions and greater freedom in the choice of sample points. We first show that under certain circumstances, comparisons between spatially disjoint image regions are, on average, more valuable for recognition than features that measure local contrast. Second, we learn â\u20ACœoptimalâ\u20AC? sets of region comparisons for recognizing faces across varying pose and illumination. We propose a representational primitive---the dissociated dipole---that permits an integration of edge-based and region-based representations. This primitive is then evaluated using the FERET database of face images and then compared to established local and global algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3285","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3285","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23560","fieldValue":"McLeod, Dennis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23561","fieldValue":"Kwan, Stephen K"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23561","fieldValue":"ACM"}
