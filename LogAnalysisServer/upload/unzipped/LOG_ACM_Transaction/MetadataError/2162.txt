Our human model includes all of the relevant articular bones and muscles, including 103 bones (163 articular degrees of freedom) plus a total of 823 muscle actuators embedded in a finite element model of the musculotendinous soft tissues of the body that produces realistic deformations. To coordinate the numerous muscle actuators in order to produce natural swimming movements, we develop a biomimetically motivated motor control system based on Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), which learns to produce activation signals that drive the numerous muscle actuators."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17259","fieldValue":" Existing methods for surface quadrangulation cannot ensure accurate alignment with feature or boundary curves and tight control of local element size, which are important requirements in many numerical applications (e.g., FEA). Some methods rely on a prescribed direction field to guide quadrangulation for feature alignment, but such a direction field may conflict with a desired density field, thus making it difficult to control the element size. We propose a new spectral method that achieves both accurate feature curve alignment and tight control of local element size according to a given density field. Specifically, the following three technical contributions are made. First, to make the quadrangulation align accurately with feature curves or surface boundary curves, we introduce novel boundary conditions for wave-like functions that satisfy the Helmholtz equation approximately in the least squares sense. Such functions, called quasi-eigenfunctions, are computed efficiently as the solutions to a variational problem. Second, the mesh element size is effectively controlled by locally modulating the Laplace operator in the Helmholtz equation according to a given density field. Third, to improve robustness, we propose a novel scheme to minimize the vibration difference of the quasi-eigenfunction in two orthogonal directions. It is demonstrated by extensive experiments that our method outperforms previous methods in generating feature-aligned quadrilateral meshes with tight control of local elememt size. We further present some preliminary results to show that our method can be extended to generating hex-dominant volume meshes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17260","fieldValue":" Sparsity in the Fourier domain is an important property that enables the dense reconstruction of signals, such as 4D light fields, from a small set of samples. The sparsity of natural spectra is often derived from continuous arguments, but reconstruction algorithms typically work in the discrete Fourier domain. These algorithms usually assume that sparsity derived from continuous principles will hold under discrete sampling. This article makes the critical observation that sparsity is much greater in the continuous Fourier spectrum than in the discrete spectrum. This difference is caused by a windowing effect. When we sample a signal over a finite window, we convolve its spectrum by an infinite sinc, which destroys much of the sparsity that was in the continuous domain. Based on this observation, we propose an approach to reconstruction that optimizes for sparsity in the continuous Fourier spectrum. We describe the theory behind our approach and discuss how it can be used to reduce sampling requirements and improve reconstruction quality. Finally, we demonstrate the power of our approach by showing how it can be applied to the task of recovering non-Lambertian light fields from a small number of 1D viewpoint trajectories."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17260","fieldValue":"ACM"}
