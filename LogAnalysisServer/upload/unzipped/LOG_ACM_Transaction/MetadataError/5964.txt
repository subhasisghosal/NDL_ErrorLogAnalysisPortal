The movements of such speakers are limited by their athetoid symptoms and their consonants are often unstable or unclear, which makes it difficult for them to communicate. Exemplar-based spectral conversion using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is applied to a voice from a speaker with an articulation disorder. In our conventional work, we used a combined dictionary that was constructed from the source speakerâ\u20AC™s vowels and the consonants from a target speaker without articulation disorders in order to preserve the speakerâ\u20AC™s individuality. However, this conventional exemplar-based approach needs to use all the training exemplars (frames), and it may cause mismatching of phonemes between input signals and selected exemplars. In order to reduce the mismatching of phoneme alignment, we propose a phoneme-categorized subdictionary and a dictionary selection method using NMF. The effectiveness of this method was confirmed by comparing its effectiveness with that of a conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based and a conventional exemplar-based method."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1490","fieldValue":"NMF"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1490","fieldValue":"Individuality-Preserving Voice Conversion for Articulation Disorders Using Phoneme-Categorized Exemplars"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5831","fieldValue":"Quinn, Alexander J"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5831","fieldValue":"Bederson, Benjamin B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5831","fieldValue":" Todayâ\u20AC™s mobile devices are equipped with a variety of tools that enable users to capture and share their daily experiences. However, designing authoring tools that effectively integrate the discrete media-capture components of mobile devices to enable rich expression---especially by children---remains a challenge. Evaluating such tools authentically, as they are being used in-situ, can be even more challenging. We detail a long-term, multimethod study on the use of StoryKit, a mobile storytelling application. By taking advantage of a public distribution channel, we were able to evaluate StoryKitâ\u20AC™s use on a scale beyond that usually found in lab settings or limited field trials. Our results show that StoryKitâ\u20AC™s simple but well-integrated interface attracted a high number of dedicated users in education contexts at all levels, including children with special learning needs. We include a discussion of the challenges and opportunities that similar â\u20ACœin the wildâ\u20AC? studies hold for HCI research."}
