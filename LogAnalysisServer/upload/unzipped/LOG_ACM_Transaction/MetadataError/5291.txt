However, a potential limitation of these approaches is their assumption on the common and constant activity level of a transcription factor (TF) on all the genes in any given experimental condition; for example, any TF is assumed to be either an activator or a repressor, but not both, while it is known that some TFs can be dual regulators. Rather than assuming a common linear regression model for all the genes, we propose using separate regression models for various gene groups; the genes can be grouped based on their functions or some clustering results. Furthermore, to take advantage of the hierarchical structure of many existing gene function annotation systems, such as Gene Ontology (GO), we propose a shrinkage method that borrows information from relevant gene groups. Applications to a yeast dataset and simulations lend support for our proposed methods. In particular, we find that the shrinkage method consistently works well under various scenarios. We recommend the use of the shrinkage method as a useful alternative to the existing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4370","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4370","fieldValue":"Incorporating Gene Functions into Regression Analysis of DNA-Protein Binding Data and Gene Expression Data to Construct Transcriptional Networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4370","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4370","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4371","fieldValue":"Mak, Man-Wai"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4371","fieldValue":"Kung, Sun-Yuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4371","fieldValue":" The subcellular locations of proteins are important functional annotations. An effective and reliable subcellular localization method is necessary for proteomics research. This paper introduces a new method---PairProSVM---to automatically predict the subcellular locations of proteins. The profiles of all protein sequences in the training set are constructed by PSI-BLAST and the pairwise profile-alignment scores are used to form feature vectors for training a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. It was found that PairProSVM outperforms the methods that are based on sequence alignment and amino-acid compositions even if most of the homologous sequences have been removed. This paper also demonstrates that the performance of PairProSVM is sensitive (and somewhat proportional) to the degree of its kernel matrix meeting the Mercer's condition. PairProSVM was evaluated on Reinhardt and Hubbard's, Huang and Li's, and Gardy et al.'s protein datasets. The overall accuracies on these three datasets reach 99.3\\\\%, 76.5\\\\%, and 91.9\\\\%, respectively, which are higher than or comparable to those obtained by sequence alignment and by the methods compared in this paper."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4371","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
