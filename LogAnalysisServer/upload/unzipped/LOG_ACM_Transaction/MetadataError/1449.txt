{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15436","fieldValue":" We describe a new approach to rotoscoping --- the process of tracking contours in a video sequence --- that combines computer vision with user interaction. In order to track contours in video, the user specifies curves in two or more frames; these curves are used as keyframes by a computer-vision-based tracking algorithm. The user may interactively refine the curves and then restart the tracking algorithm. Combining computer vision with user interaction allows our system to track any sequence with significantly less effort than interpolation-based systems --- and with better reliability than \"pure\" computer vision systems. Our tracking algorithm is cast as a spacetime optimization problem that solves for time-varying curve shapes based on an input video sequence and user-specified constraints. We demonstrate our system with several rotoscoped examples. Additionally, we show how these rotoscoped contours can be used to help create cartoon animation by attaching user-drawn strokes to the tracked contours."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15436","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15436","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2463","fieldValue":" Previous work has developed algorithms for finding an equitable convex partition that partitions the plane into n convex pieces each containing an equal number of red and blue points. Motivated by a vehicle routing heuristic, we look at a related problem where each piece must contain one point and an equal fraction of the area of some convex polygon. We first show how algorithms for solving the older problem lead to approximate solutions for this new equitable convex partition problem. Then we demonstrate a new algorithm that finds an exact solution to our problem in O(N nlog N) time or operations, where n is the number of points, m the number of vertices or edges of the polygon, and N:&equals;n+m the sum."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2463","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2463","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15437","fieldValue":" This paper describes a method for bringing two videos (recorded at different times) into spatiotemporal alignment, then comparing and combining corresponding pixels for applications such as background subtraction, compositing, and increasing dynamic range. We align a pair of videos by searching for frames that best match according to a robust image registration process. This process uses locally weighted regression to interpolate and extrapolate high-likelihood image correspondences, allowing new correspondences to be discovered and refined. Image regions that cannot be matched are detected and ignored, providing robustness to changes in scene content and lighting, which allows a variety of new applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15438","fieldValue":" The ability to interactively control viewpoint while watching a video is an exciting application of image-based rendering. The goal of our work is to render dynamic scenes with interactive viewpoint control using a relatively small number of video cameras. In this paper, we show how high-quality video-based rendering of dynamic scenes can be accomplished using multiple synchronized video streams combined with novel image-based modeling and rendering algorithms. Once these video streams have been processed, we can synthesize any intermediate view between cameras at any time, with the potential for space-time manipulation.In our approach, we first use a novel color segmentation-based stereo algorithm to generate high-quality photoconsistent correspondences across all camera views. Mattes for areas near depth discontinuities are then automatically extracted to reduce artifacts during view synthesis. Finally, a novel temporal two-layer compressed representation that handles matting is developed for rendering at interactive rates."}
