One critical issue for routing in MANETs is how to select reliable paths that can last as long as possible since terminal mobility may cause radio links to be broken frequently. To solve this problem, a criterion that can judge path reliability is needed. The reliability of a path depends on the number of links and the reliability of each link constituting the path. Many routing metrics in terms of number of links have been proposed, such as the shortest path routing. However, how to measure link availability or reliability in order to find more reliable paths has not been addressed adequately in the literature. (By a link being available, we mean that the radio quality of the link satisfies the minimum requirement for successful communication. Link availability is used to measure probability or degree that a link is available. The terms availability and reliability are used interchangeable in this paper.) This paper first introduces a prediction-based link availability estimation to quantify the link reliability. This quantity makes use of some instantly available information and also considers the dynamic nature of link status in order to properly reflect the link reliability. Then, this quantity has been further used to develop routing metrics for path selection in terms of path reliability to improve routing performances. The proposed schemes have been investigated through computer simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9407","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9408","fieldValue":" Most existing topology control algorithms assume homogeneous wireless networks with uniform maximal transmission power, and cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous wireless networks where the maximal transmission power of each node may be different. We present two localized topology control algorithms for heterogeneous networks: Directed Relative Neighborhood Graph (DRNG) and Directed Local Spanning Subgraph (DLSS). In both algorithms, each node independently builds its neighbor set by adjusting the transmission power, and defines the network topology by using only local information. We prove that: 1) both DRNG and DLSS can preserve network connectivity; 2) the out-degree of any node in the resulting topology generated by DRNG or DLSS is bounded by a constant; and 3) DRNG and DLSS can preserve network bi-directionality. Simulation results indicate that DRNG and DLSS significantly outperform existing topology control algorithms for heterogeneous networks in several aspects."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9408","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9408","fieldValue":"ACM"}
