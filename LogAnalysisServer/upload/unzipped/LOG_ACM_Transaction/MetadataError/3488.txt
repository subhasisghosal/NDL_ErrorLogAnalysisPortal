The capacity in our analysis is the end-to-end per-node throughput. We analyze the typical traffic pattern for sensor networks, where traffics are destined to or originated from the sink. The main results of our analysis are summarized as follows. (1) The network capacity is O(1\/N) for both omni and directional antennas, where N is the number of sensor nodes in the network. (2) In the case of line deployment, the capacity ratio of directional antennas over omni antennas is bounded by (2q+3)\/(2q-1), where q is the ratio of the interference radius to the transmission radius. (3) In the case of two-dimensional deployment, the capacity for using directional antennas is O(1\/Î¸) for m = 2, and $O(lgm\/Î¸^2$lg(1\/Î¸)) for m > 2, where m is the number of radios (antennas) on each node and Î¸ is the beamwidth of antennas. (4) When there are n > 1 sinks, the capacity has a non-monotonic relationship with the transmission radius. The optimal transmission radius depends on the ratio of n\/q. (5) The capacity ratio of directional antennas over omni antennas in multi-channel networks decreases as the channel number\/radio number ratio c\/m increases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21399","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21399","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21400","fieldValue":" This article is concerned with a new distributed state estimation problem for a class of dynamical systems in sensor networks. The target plant is described by a set of differential equations disturbed by a Brownian motion and randomly occurring nonlinearities (RONs) subject to time delays. The RONs are investigated here to reflect network-induced randomly occurring regulation of the delayed states on the current ones. Through available measurement output transmitted from the sensors, a distributed state estimator is designed to estimate the states of the target system, where each sensor can communicate with the neighboring sensors according to the given topology by means of a directed graph. The state estimation is carried out in a distributed way and is therefore applicable to online application. By resorting to the Lyapunov functional combined with stochastic analysis techniques, several delay-dependent criteria are established that not only ensure the estimation error to be globally asymptotically stable in the mean square, but also guarantee the existence of the desired estimator gains that can then be explicitly expressed when certain matrix inequalities are solved. A numerical example is given to verify the designed distributed state estimators."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21400","fieldValue":"Distributed state estimation in sensor networks with randomly occurring nonlinearities subject to time delays"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21401","fieldValue":" Data aggregation is necessary for extending the network lifetime of wireless sensor nodes with limited processing and power capabilities, since energy expended in transmitting a single data bit would be at least several orders of magnitude higher when compared to that needed for a 32-bit computation. Therefore, in this article, a novel nonlinear adaptive pulse coded modulation-based compression (NADPCMC) scheme is proposed for data aggregation in a wireless sensor network (WSN). The NADPCMC comprises of two estimatorsâ\u20AC\u201Done at the source or transmitter and the second one at the destination node. The estimator at the source node approximates the data value for each sample. The difference between the data sample and its estimate is quantized and transmitted to the next hop node instead of the actual data sample, thus reducing the amount of data transmission and rending energy savings. A similar estimator at the next hop node or base station reconstructs the original data. It is demonstrated that repeated application of the NADPCMC scheme along the route in a WSN results in data aggregation. Satisfactory performance of the proposed scheme in terms of distortion, compression ratio, and energy efficiency and in the presence of estimation and quantization errors for data aggregation is demonstrated using the Lyapunov approach. Then the performance of the proposed scheme is contrasted with the available compression schemes in an NS-2 environment through several benchmarking datasets. Simulation and hardware results demonstrate that almost 50&percnt; energy savings with low distortion levels below 5&percnt; and low overhead are observed when compared to no compression. Iteratively applying the proposed compression scheme at the cluster head nodes along the routes over the network yields an additional improvement of 20&percnt; in energy savings per aggregation with an overall distortion below 8&percnt;."}
