The two-level logic optimizer performs the logic minimization for low power targeting static PLA, general logic gates, and dynamic PLA implementations. We modify the espresso algorithm by adding our heuristics, which bias logic minimization toward lowering power dissipation. In our heuristics, signal probabilities and transition densities are two important parameters. The experimental results are promising."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12746","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12746","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12747","fieldValue":" Functional partitioning assigns the functions of a system's program-like specification among system components, such as standard-software and custom-hardware processors. We introduce a new transformation, called procedure cloning, that significantly improves functional partitioning results. The transformation creates a clone of a procedure for sole use by a particular procedure caller, so the clone can be assigned to the caller's processor, which in turn improves performance through reduced communication. Heuristics are used to prevent the exponential size increase that could occur if cloning were done indiscriminately. We introduce a variety of cloning heuristics, highlight experiments demonstrating the improvements obtained using cloning, and compare the various cloning heuristics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12748","fieldValue":"Vrudhula, Sarma B K"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12748","fieldValue":" We present an efficient technique to reduce the switching activity in a technology-mapped CMOS combinational circuit based on local logic transformations. The transformations consist of adding redundant connections or gates so as to reduce switching activity. We describe simple and efficient procedures, based on logic implication, for identifying the sources and targets of the redundant connections. Additionally, we give procedures that permit the designer to trade-off power and delay after the transformations. Results of experiments on both the MCNC benchmark circuits and the circuits of a PowerPC microprocessor chip are given. The results indicate that significant power reduction of a CMOS combinational circuit can be achieved with very low area overhead, delay penalty, and computational cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12748","fieldValue":"ACM"}
