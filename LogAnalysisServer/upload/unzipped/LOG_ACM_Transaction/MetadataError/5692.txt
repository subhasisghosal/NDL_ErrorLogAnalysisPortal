{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5100","fieldValue":" The comparison of ordinary partitions of a set of objects is well established in the clustering literature, which comprehends several studies on the analysis of the properties of similarity measures for comparing partitions. However, similarity measures for clusterings are not readily applicable to biclusterings, since each bicluster is a tuple of two sets (of rows and columns), whereas a cluster is only a single set (of rows). Some biclustering similarity measures have been defined as minor contributions in papers which primarily report on proposals and evaluation of biclustering algorithms or comparative analyses of biclustering algorithms. The consequence is that some desirable properties of such measures have been overlooked in the literature. We review 14 biclustering similarity measures. We define eight desirable properties of a biclustering measure, discuss their importance, and prove which properties each of the reviewed measures has. We show examples drawn and inspired from important studies in which several biclustering measures convey misleading evaluations due to the absence of one or more of the discussed properties. We also advocate the use of a more general comparison approach that is based on the idea of transforming the original problem of comparing biclusterings into an equivalent problem of comparing clustering partitions with overlapping clusters."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5100","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5100","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5100","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5101","fieldValue":" It is known that nucleotide sequences are not totally homogeneous and this heterogeneity could not be due to random fluctuations only. Such heterogeneity poses a problem of making sequence segmentation into a set of homogeneous parts divided by the points called \"change points\". In this work we investigated a special case of change points--paired change points (PCP). We used a well-known property of coding sequences--triplet periodicity (TP). The sequences that we are especially interested in consist of three successive parts: the first and the last parts have similar TP while the middle part has different TP type. We aimed to find the genes with PCP and provide explanation for this phenomenon. We developed a mathematical method for the PCP detection based on the new measure of similarity between TP matrices. We investigated 66,936 bacterial genes from 17 bacterial genomes and revealed 2,700 genes with PCP and 6,459 genes with single change point (SCP). We developed a mathematical approach to visualize the PCP cases. We suppose that PCP could be associated with double fusion or insertion events. The results of investigating the sequences with artificial insertions\/fusions and distribution of TP inside the genome support the idea that the real number of genes formed by insertion\/ fusion events could be 5-7 times greater than the number of genes revealed in the present work."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5101","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5101","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5101","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5102","fieldValue":" In this paper, the synchronizations of Boolean networks with different update schemes (synchronized Boolean networks and asynchronous Boolean networks) are investigated. All nodes in Boolean network are represented in terms of semi-tensor product. First, we give the concept of inner synchronization and observe that all nodes in a Boolean network are synchronized with each other. Second, we investigate the outer synchronization between a driving Boolean network and a corresponding response Boolean network. We provide not only the concept of traditional complete synchronization, but also the anti-synchronization and get the anti-synchronization in simulation. Third, we extend the outer synchronization to asynchronous Boolean network and get the complete synchronization between an asynchronous Boolean network and a response Boolean network. Consequently, theorems for synchronization of Boolean networks and asynchronous Boolean networks are derived. Examples are provided to show the correctness of our theorems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5102","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
