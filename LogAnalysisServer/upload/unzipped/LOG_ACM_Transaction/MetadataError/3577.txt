We recognize that for these protocols to work effectively, nodes must have consistent information about their shared neighborhoods. Different types of faults, however, can affect this information, severely impacting a protocolâ\u20AC™s performance. We factor this problem out of existing WSN protocols and argue that a notion of neighborhood view consistency (NVC) can be embedded within existing designs to improve their performance. To this end, we study the problem from both a theoretical and a system perspective. We prove that the problem cannot be solved in an asynchronous system using any of Chandra and Touegâ\u20AC™s failure detectors. Because of this, we introduce a new software device called pseudocrash failure detector (PCD), study its properties, and identify necessary and sufficient conditions for solving NVC with PCDs. We prove that, in the presence of transient faults, NVC is impossible to solve with any PCDs, thus define two weaker specifications of the problem. We develop a global algorithm that satisfies both specifications in the presence of unidirectional links, and a localized algorithm that solves the weakest specification in networks of bidirectional links. We implement the latter atop two different WSN operating systems, integrate our implementations with four different WSN protocols, and run extensive micro-benchmarks and full-stack experiments on a real 90-node WSN testbed. Our results show that the performance significantly improves for NVC-equipped protocols; for example, the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) halves energy consumption with higher data delivery."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21615","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21615","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21616","fieldValue":" Over recent years, the continuous interest in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has led to the appearance of new modeling methods and simulation environments for WSN applications. A broad variety of different simulation tools have been designed to explore and validate WSN systems before actual implementation and real-world deployment. These tools address different design aspects and offer various simulation abstractions to represent and model real-world behavior. In this article, we present a comprehensive comparative study of mainstream open-source simulation tools for WSNs. Two benchmark applications are designed to evaluate the frameworks with respect to the simulation runtime performance, network throughput, communication medium modeling, packet reception rate, network latency, and power consumption estimation accuracy. Such metrics are also evaluated against measurements on physical prototypes. Our experiments show that the tools produce equivalent results from a functional point of view and capacity to model communication phenomena, while the ability to model details of the execution platform significantly impacts the runtime simulation performance and the power estimation accuracy. The benchmark applications are also made available in the public domain for further studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21616","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21616","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21617","fieldValue":" Security plays a vital role in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for providing reliability to the network. In WSN, where nodes, in addition to having their inbuilt capability of sensing, processing, and communicating data, also possess certain risks. These risks expose them to attacks and bring in many security challenges. Many researchers are engaged in developing innovative design paradigms to address security issues by developing trust management systems. In WSN, trust is important for the establishment of cooperation among the sensor nodes. The article presents a sociopsychological model for detecting fraudulent nodes in WSN. The three factors, viz. ability, benevolence, and integrity, are used for the computation of trust. Furthermore, the article provides a novel consensus-aware sociopsychological approach to deal even in the presence of higher number of fraudulent nodes than benevolent nodes. The proposed work has been implemented in the LabVIEW platform and extensive simulations were carried out to study its performance. Additionally, it is experimentally evaluated on a testbed of size 16 nodes to obtain results that demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21617","fieldValue":"ACM"}
