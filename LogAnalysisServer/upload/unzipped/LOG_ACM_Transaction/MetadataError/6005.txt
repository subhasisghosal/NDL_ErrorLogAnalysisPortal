The interface design is innovative because users panned with an overview:detail view scale difference that was up to 57 times larger than established guidelines, and 1 million pixel â\u20ACœthumbnailâ\u20AC? overviews that leveraged the real estate of high-resolution workstation displays. The research involved experts performing real work (pathologists diagnosing cancer), using datasets that were up to 3,150 times larger than those used in previous studies that involved navigating images. The evaluation provides evidence about the effectiveness of the interfaces and characterizes how experts navigate gigapixel images when performing real work. Similar interfaces could be adopted in applications that use other types of high-resolution images (e.g., remote sensing or high-throughput microscopy)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5927","fieldValue":" This article aims to deepen understanding of these mass interactions in online sports viewing through studying Naver Sports, the largest online sports viewing service in Korea. We examined the diverse aspects of mass interactions, including interactive experiences, usage motives, and relationships between usage patterns and motives, through analysis of almost 6 million chats from Naver Sports and from self-reporting survey data from 1,123 users. First, we found that online sports viewing provides unique interactive experiences when compared to other settings such as offline sports viewing and social TV viewing with friends. Second, we found the key motives inspiring online sports viewing include the following: sharing feelings\/thoughts, wanting to be entertained, sharing information, and wanting to feel membership in a group. Third, these motives were significantly related to specific usage patterns. Finally, we explored how the studyâ\u20AC™s key findings can offer practical design implications to enhance online sports viewing services, and to show system designers how to support particular usage patterns to better accommodate specific user motives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5928","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5928","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5929","fieldValue":" Guilt and envy play an important role in social interaction. Guilt occurs when individuals cause harm to others or break social norms. Envy occurs when individuals compare themselves unfavorably to others and desire to benefit from the othersâ\u20AC™ advantage. In both cases, these emotions motivate people to act and change the status quo: following guilt, people try to make amends for the perceived transgression, and following envy, people try to harm envied others. In this article, we present two experiments that study participantsâ\u20AC™ experience of guilt and envy when engaging in social decision making with machines and humans. The results showed that, though experiencing the same level of envy, people felt considerably less guilt with machines than with humans. These effects occurred both with subjective and behavioral measures of guilt and envy, and in three different economic games: public goods, ultimatum, and dictator game. This poses an important challenge for human-computer interaction because, as shown here, it leads people to systematically exploit machines, when compared to humans. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for the design of human-machine interaction systems that hope to achieve the kind of efficiency -- cooperation, fairness, reciprocity, etc. -- we see in human-human interaction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5929","fieldValue":"ACM"}
