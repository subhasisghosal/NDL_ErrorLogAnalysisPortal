{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4956","fieldValue":" Study of the molecular control of organ growth requires establishment of the causal relationship between gene expression and cell behaviors. We seek to understand this relationship at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This requires the spatial mapping and temporal alignment of different functional domains into a single template. Live-cell imaging techniques allow us to observe real-time organ primordia growth and gene expression dynamics at cellular resolution. In this paper, we propose a framework for the measurement of growth features at the 3D reconstructed surface of organ primordia, as well as algorithms for robust time alignment of primordia. We computed areas and deformation values from reconstructed 3D surfaces of individual primordia from live-cell imaging data. Based on these growth measurements, we applied a multiple feature landscape matching (LAM-M) algorithm to ensure a reliable temporal alignment of multiple primordia. Although the original landscape matching (LAM) algorithm motivated our alignment approach, it sometimes fails to properly align growth curves in the presence of high noise\/distortion. To overcome this shortcoming, we modified the cost function to consider the landscape of the corresponding growth features. We also present an alternate parameter-free growth alignment algorithm which performs as well as LAM-M for high-quality data, but is more robust to the presence of outliers or noise. Results on primordia and guppy evolutionary growth data show that the proposed alignment framework performs at least as well as the LAM algorithm in the general case, and significantly better in the case of increased noise."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4956","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4956","fieldValue":"Quantitative Analysis of Live-Cell Growth at the Shoot Apex of Arabidopsis thaliana: Algorithms for Feature Measurement and Temporal Alignment"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4956","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4956","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1423","fieldValue":"McGrenere, Joanna"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1423","fieldValue":" Tablet PCs are gaining popularity, but many individuals still struggle with pen-based interaction. In a previous baseline study, we examined the types of difficulties younger and older adults encounter when using pen-based input. The research reported in this article seeks to address one of these errors, namely, missing just below. This error occurs in a menu selection task when a userâ\u20AC™s selection pattern is downwardly shifted, such that the top edge of the menu item below the target is selected relatively often, while the corresponding top edge of the target itself is seldom selected. We developed two approaches for addressing missing just below errors: reassigning selections along the top edge and deactivating them. In a laboratory evaluation, only the deactivated edge approach showed promise overall. Further analysis of our data revealed that individual differences played a large role in our results and identified a new source of selection difficulty. Specifically, we observed two error-prone groups of users: the low hitters, who, like participants in the baseline study, made missing just below errors, and the high hitters, who, in contrast, had difficulty with errors on the item above. All but one of the older participants fell into one of these error-prone groups, reinforcing that older users do need better support for selecting menu items with a pen. Preliminary analysis of the performance data suggests both of our approaches were beneficial for the low hitters, but that additional techniques are needed to meet the needs of the high hitters and to address the challenge of supporting both groups in a single interface."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1423","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1423","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4957","fieldValue":" Adequate sampling of the conformational space is a central challenge in ab initio protein structure prediction. In the absence of a template structure, a conformational search procedure guided by an energy function explores the conformational space, gathering an ensemble of low-energy decoy conformations. If the sampling is inadequate, the native structure may be missed altogether. Even if reproduced, a subsequent stage that selects a subset of decoys for further structural detail and energetic refinement may discard near-native decoys if they are high energy or insufficiently represented in the ensemble. Sampling should produce a decoy ensemble that facilitates the subsequent selection of near-native decoys. In this paper, we investigate a robotics-inspired framework that allows directly measuring the role of energy in guiding sampling. Testing demonstrates that a soft energy bias steers sampling toward a diverse decoy ensemble less prone to exploiting energetic artifacts and thus more likely to facilitate retainment of near-native conformations by selection techniques. We employ two different energy functions, the associative memory Hamiltonian with water and Rosetta. Results show that enhanced sampling provides a rigorous testing of energy functions and exposes different deficiencies in them, thus promising to guide development of more accurate representations and energy functions."}
