{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1157","fieldValue":" We investigate the complexity of algorithms in message-driven models. In such models, events in the computation can only be caused by message receptions, but not by the passage of time. Hutle and Widder [2005a] have shown that there is no deterministic message-driven self-stabilizing implementation of the eventually strong failure detector and thus Ω in systems with uncertainty in message delays and channels of unknown capacity using only bounded space. Under stronger assumptions it was shown that even the eventually perfect failure detector can be implemented in message-driven systems consisting of at least f + 2 processes (f being the upper bound on the number of processes that crash during an execution). In this article we show that f + 2 is in fact a lower bound in message-driven systems, even if nonstabilizing algorithms are considered. This contrasts time-driven models where f + 1 is sufficient for failure detector implementations. Moreover, we investigate algorithms where not all processes send message, that is, are active, but some (in a predetermined set) remain passive. Here, we show that the f + 2 processes required for message-driven systems must be active, while in time-driven systems it suffices that f processes are active. We also provide message-driven implementations of Ω. Our algorithms are efficient in the sense that not all processes have to send messages forever, which is an improvement to previous message-driven failure detector implementations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1157","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1157","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2297","fieldValue":" The intersection of sorted arrays problem has applications in search engines such as Google. Previous work has proposed and compared deterministic algorithms for this problem, in an adaptive analysis based on the encoding size of a certificate of the result (cost analysis). We define the alternation analysis, based on the nondeterministic complexity of an instance. In this analysis we prove that there is a deterministic algorithm asymptotically performing as well as any randomized algorithm in the comparison model. We define the redundancy analysis, based on a measure of the internal redundancy of the instance. In this analysis we prove that any algorithm optimal in the redundancy analysis is optimal in the alternation analysis, but that there is a randomized algorithm which performs strictly better than any deterministic algorithm in the comparison model. Finally, we describe how these results can be extended beyond the comparison model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2297","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2297","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/13599","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"December 2012\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13752\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, December 2012\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"August 2012\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13751\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, August 2012\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"May 2012\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13750\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, May 2012\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"February 2012\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13749\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, February 2012\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/13600","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"November 2013\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13756\",\"title\":\"Issue 4(Invited papers issue), November 2013\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"August 2013\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13755\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, August 2013\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"June 2013\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13754\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, June 2013\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"April 2013\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13753\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, April 2013\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/13601","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"December 2014\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13760\",\"title\":\"Issue 4(Invited Articles Issue, SIGMOD 2013, PODS 2013 and ICDT 2013), December 2014\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"September 2014\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13759\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, September 2014\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"May 2014\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13758\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, May 2014\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"January 2014\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13757\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, January 2014\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/13602","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"February 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13765\",\"title\":\"Issue 4(Special Issue: Invited 2014 PODS and EDBT Revised Articles), February 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"December 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13764\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, December 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"October 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13763\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, October 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"June 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13762\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, June 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"March 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13761\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, March 2015\"}]"}
