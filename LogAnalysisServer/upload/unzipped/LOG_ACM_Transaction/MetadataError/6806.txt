More importantly, the new challenge is to develop the capability to understand and interpret the burgeoning volume of data to take advantage of the opportunities it provides in many human endeavors, ranging from science to business. Data Science, and in business schools, Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A) are emerging disciplines that seek to address the demands of this new era. Big Data and BI&A present unique challenges and opportunities not only for the research community, but also for Information Systems (IS) programs at business schools. In this essay, we provide a brief overview of BI&A, speculate on the role of BI&A education in business schools, present the challenges facing IS departments, and discuss the role of IS curricula and program development, in delivering BI&A education. We contend that a new vision for the IS discipline should address these challenges."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8173","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8173","fieldValue":"Business Intelligence and Analytics Education, and Program Development: A Unique Opportunity for the Information Systems Discipline"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8174","fieldValue":"Lim, Ee-Peng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8174","fieldValue":"Hoang, Tuan-Anh"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8174","fieldValue":" Real-time microblogging systems such as Twitter offer users an easy and lightweight means to exchange information. Instead of writing formal and lengthy messages, microbloggers prefer to frequently broadcast several short messages to be read by other users. Only when messages are interesting, are they propagated further by the readers. In this article, we examine user behavior relevant to information propagation through microblogging. We specifically use retweeting activities among Twitter users to define and model originating and promoting behavior. We propose a basic model for measuring the two behaviors, a mutual dependency model, which considers the mutual relationships between the two behaviors, and a range-based model, which considers the depth and reach of usersâ\u20AC™ original tweets. Next, we compare the three behavior models and contrast them with the existing work on modeling influential Twitter users. Last, to demonstrate their applicability, we further employ the behavior models to detect interesting events from sudden changes in aggregated information propagation behavior of Twitter users. The results will show that the proposed behavior models can be effectively applied to detect interesting events in the Twitter stream, compared to the baseline tweet-based approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8174","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8174","fieldValue":"Who is Retweeting the Tweeters?
