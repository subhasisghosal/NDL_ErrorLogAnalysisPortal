{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1269","fieldValue":" Self-adaptive software has become increasingly important to address the new challenges of complex computing systems. To achieve adaptation, software must be designed and implemented by following suitable criteria, methods, and strategies. Past research has been mostly addressing adaptation by developing solutions at the software architecture level. This work, instead, focuses on finer-grain programming language-level solutions. We analyze three main linguistic approaches: metaprogramming, aspect-oriented programming, and context-oriented programming. The first two are general-purpose linguistic mechanisms, whereas the third is a specific and focused approach developed to support context-aware applications. This paradigm provides specialized language-level abstractions to implement dynamic adaptation and modularize behavioral variations in adaptive systems. The article shows how the three approaches can support the implementation of adaptive systems and compares the pros and cons offered by each solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1269","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1269","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/3549","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"September 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3582\",\"title\":\"Issue 9, September 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"August 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3581\",\"title\":\"Issue 8, August 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"July 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3580\",\"title\":\"Issue 7, July 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"June 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3579\",\"title\":\"Issue 6, June 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"May 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3578\",\"title\":\"Issue 5, May 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"April 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3577\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, April 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"March 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3575\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, March 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"February 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3576\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, February 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"January 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3574\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, January 2016\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3583","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3583","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3584","fieldValue":" We propose a novel method for objective speech intelligibility prediction which can be useful in many application domains such as hearing instruments and forensics. Most objective intelligibility measures available in the literature employ some kind of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or a correlation-based comparison between the spectro-temporal representations of clean and processed speech. In this paper, we investigate the speech intelligibility prediction from the viewpoint of information theory and introduce novel objective intelligibility measures based on the estimated mutual information between the temporal envelopes of clean speech and processed speech in the subband domain. Mutual information allows to account for higher order statistics and hence to consider dependencies beyond the conventional second order statistics. Using data from three different listening tests it is shown that the proposed objective intelligibility measures provide promising results for speech intelligibility prediction in different scenarios of speech enhancement where speech is processed by non-linear modification strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3584","fieldValue":"Objective Intelligibility Measures Based on Mutual Information for Speech Subjected to Speech Enhancement Processing"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3584","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3584","fieldValue":"ACM"}
