For a rational Bézier surface patch, there are many possible polyhedral control structures, and none is canonical. We propose a not necessarily polyhedral control structure for rational surface patches, regular control surfaces, which are certain $C^0$ spline surfaces. While not unique, regular control surfaces are exactly the possible limiting positions of a rational Bézier patch when the weights vary."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/16508","fieldValue":"B&eacute;zier patch"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16509","fieldValue":"Yoon, Sung-Eui"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16509","fieldValue":"Heo, Jae-Pil"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16509","fieldValue":"Tong, Ruo-Feng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16509","fieldValue":" We present a novel culling algorithm to perform fast and robust continuous collision detection between deforming volume meshes. This includes a continuous separating axis test that can conservatively check whether two volume meshes overlap during a given time interval. In addition, we present efficient methods to eliminate redundant elementary tests between the features (e.g., vertices, edges, and faces) of volume elements (e.g., tetrahedra, hexahedra, triangular prisms, etc.). Our approach is applicable to various deforming meshes, including those with changing topologies, and efficiently computes the first time of contact. We are able to perform inter-object and intra-object collision queries in models represented with tens of thousands of volume elements at interactive rates on a single CPU core. Moreover, we observe more than an order of magnitude performance improvement over prior methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16509","fieldValue":"ACM"}
