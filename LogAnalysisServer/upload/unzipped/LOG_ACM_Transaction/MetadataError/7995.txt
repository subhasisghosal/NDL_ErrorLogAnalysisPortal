As recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of cores per chip, it is crucial to guarantee the scalability of NoCs in order to avoid communication to become the next performance bottleneck in multicore processors. Among other alternatives, the concept of wireless network-on-chip (WNoC) has been proposed, wherein on-chip antennas would provide native broadcast capabilities leading to enhanced network performance. Since energy consumption and chip area are the two primary constraints, this work is aimed to explore the area and energy implications of scaling a WNoC in terms of: 1) the number of cores within the chip, and 2) the capacity of each link in the network. To this end, an integral design space exploration is performed, covering implementation aspects (area and energy), communication aspects (link capacity), and network-level considerations (number of cores and network architecture). The study is entirely based upon analytical models, which will allow to benchmark the WNoC scalability against a baseline NoC. Eventually, this investigation will provide qualitative and quantitative guidelines for the design of future transceivers for wireless on-chip communication."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10808","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10808","fieldValue":"On the area and energy scalability of wireless network-on-chip: a model-based benchmarked design space exploration"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10809","fieldValue":" Underlying link-layer protocols of well-established wireless networks that use the conventional \"store-and-forward\" design paradigm cannot provide highly sustainable reliability and stability in wireless communication, which introduce significant barriers and setbacks in scalability and deployments of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a Code Embedded Distributed Adaptive and Reliable (CEDAR) link-layer framework that targets low latency and balancing en\/decoding load among nodes. CEDAR is the first comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing and designing distributed and adaptive error recovery for wireless networks. It employs a theoretically sound framework for embedding channel codes in each packet and performs the error correcting process in selected intermediate nodes in a packet's route. To identify the intermediate nodes for the decoding, we mathematically calculate the average packet delay and formalize the problem as a nonlinear integer programming problem. By minimizing the delays, we derive three propositions that: 1) can identify the intermediate nodes that minimize the propagation and transmission delay of a packet; and 2) and 3) can identify the intermediate nodes that simultaneously minimize the queuing delay and maximize the fairness of en\/decoding load of all the nodes. Guided by the propositions, we then propose a scalable and distributed scheme in CEDAR to choose the intermediate en\/decoding nodes in a route to achieve its objective. The results from real-world testbed \"NESTbed\" and simulation with MATLAB prove that CEDAR is superior to schemes using hop-by-hop decoding and destination decoding not only in packet delay and throughput but also in energy-consumption and load distribution balance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10809","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
