During data collection, messages from sensor nodes are periodically collected and sent back to a set of base stations for processing. In this article, we present and analyze a near-lifetime-optimal and scalable solution for data collection in stationary wireless sensor networks and an energy-efficient packet exchange mechanism. In our solution, instead of using a fixed network topology, we construct a set of communication topologies and apply each topology to different data collection cycles. We not only use the flexibility in distributing the traffic load across different routes in the network (spatial load balancing), but also balance the energy consumption in the time domain (temporal load balancing). We show that this method achieves an average energy consumption rate very close to the optimal value found by network flow optimization techniques. To increase the scalability, we further extend our solution such that it can be applied to networks with multiple base stations where each base station only stores part of the network configuration, cooperating with each other to find a global solution in a distributed manner. The proposed methods are analyzed and evaluated by simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21314","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21314","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21315","fieldValue":" This article reports on the development of a utility-based mechanism for managing sensing and communication in cooperative multisensor networks. The specific application on which we illustrate our mechanism is that of GlacsWeb. This is a deployed system that uses battery-powered sensors to collect environmental data related to glaciers which it transmits back to a base station so that it can be made available world-wide to researchers. In this context, we first develop a sensing protocol in which each sensor locally adjusts its sensing rate based on the value of the data it believes it will observe. The sensors employ a Bayesian linear model to decide their sampling rate and exploit the properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence to place an appropriate value on the data. Then, we detail a communication protocol that finds optimal routes for relaying this data back to the base station based on the cost of communicating it (derived from the opportunity cost of using the battery power for relaying data). Finally, we empirically evaluate our protocol by examining the impact on efficiency of a static network topology, a dynamic network topology, the size of the network, the degree of dynamism of the environment, and the mobility of the nodes. In so doing, we demonstrate that the efficiency gains of our new protocol, over the currently implemented method over a 6 month period, are 78&percnt;, 133&percnt;, 100&percnt;, and 93&percnt;, respectively. Furthermore, we show that our system performs at 65&percnt;, 70&percnt;, 63&percnt;, and 70&percnt; of the theoretical optimal, respectively, despite being a distributed protocol that operates with incomplete knowledge of the environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21315","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21315","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21316","fieldValue":" In data collection applications of low-end sensor networks, a major challenge is ensuring reliability without a significant goodput degradation. Short hops over high-quality links minimize per-hop transmissions, but long routes may cause congestion and load imbalance. Longer links can be exploited to build shorter routes, but poor links may have a high energy cost. There exists a complex interplay among routing performance (reliability, goodput, energy efficiency), link estimation, congestion control, and load balancing; we design a routing architecture, Arbutus, that exploits this interplay, and perform an extensive experimental evaluation on testbeds of 100-150 Berkeley motes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21316","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21316","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21317","fieldValue":"Nita-Rotaru, Cristina"}
