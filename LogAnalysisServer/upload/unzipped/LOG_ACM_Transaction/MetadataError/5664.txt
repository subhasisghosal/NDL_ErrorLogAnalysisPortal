{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5045","fieldValue":" In this paper efficient exact algorithms are proposed for the planted (l, d)-motif search problem. This problem is to find all motifs of length l that are planted in each input string with at most d mismatches. The \"quorum\" version of this problem is also treated in this paper to find motifs planted not in all input strings but in at least q input strings. The proposed algorithms are based on the previous algorithms called qPMSPruneI and qPMS7 that traverse a search tree starting from a l-length substring of an input string. To improve these previous algorithms, several techniques are introduced, which contribute to reducing the computation time for the traversal. In computational experiments, it will be shown that the proposed algorithms outperform the previous algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5045","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5046","fieldValue":" We propose a generic approach to replace the canonical sequence representation of genomes with graph representations, and study several applications of such extensions. We extend the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) of strings to acyclic directed labeled graphs, to support path queries as an extension to substring searching. We develop, apply, and tailor this technique to a) read alignment on an extended BWT index of a graph representing pan-genome, i.e., reference genome and known variants of it; and b) split-read alignment on an extended BWT index of a splicing graph. Other possible applications include probe\/primer design, alignments to assembly graphs, and alignments to phylogenetic tree of partial-order graphs. We report several experiments on the feasibility and applicability of the approach. Especially on highly-polymorphic genome regions our pan-genome index is making a significant improvement in alignment accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5046","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5046","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5046","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5047","fieldValue":" Intraspecific studies often make use of haplotype networks instead of gene genealogies to represent the evolution of a set of genes. Cassens et al. [3] proposed one such network reconstruction method, based on the global maximum parsimony principle, which was later recast by the first author of the present work as the problem of finding a minimum common supergraph of a set of t partially labelled trees. Although algorithms have been proposed for solving that problem on two graphs, the complexity of the general problem on trees remains unknown. In this paper, we show that the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete for t = 3. We then propose a declarative programming approach to solving the problem to optimality in practice, as well as a heuristic approach, both based on the IDP system, and assess the performance of both methods on randomly generated data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5047","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
