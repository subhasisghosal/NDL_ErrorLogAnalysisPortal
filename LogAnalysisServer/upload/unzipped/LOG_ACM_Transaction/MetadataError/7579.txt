We begin by proving a lower bound on the delay performance of any scheduling scheme for this system. We then analyze a large class of throughput optimal policies which have been studied extensively in the literature. The delay analysis of these systems has been limited to asymptotic behavior in the heavy traffic regime and order results. We obtain a tighter upper bound on the delay performance for these systems. We use the insights gained by the upper and lower bound analysis to develop an estimate for the expected delay of wireless networks with mutually independent arrival streams operating under the well-known maximum weighted matching (MWM) scheduling policy. We show via simulations that the delay performance of the MWM policy is often close to the lower bound, which means that it is not only throughput optimal, but also provides excellent delay performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9966","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9966","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9966","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9967","fieldValue":" This paper considers the problem of pricing and transmission scheduling for an access point (AP) in a wireless network, where the AP provides service to a set of mobile users. The goal of the AP is to maximize its own time-average profit. We first obtain the optimum time-average profit of the AP and prove the \"Optimality of Two Prices\" theorem. We then develop an online scheme that jointly solves the pricing and transmission scheduling problem in a dynamic environment. The scheme uses an admission price and a business decision as tools to regulate the incoming traffic and to maximize revenue. We show the scheme can achieve any average profit that is arbitrarily close to the optimum, with a tradeoff in average delay. This holds for general Markovian dynamics for channel and user state variation, and does not require a priori knowledge of the Markov model. The model and methodology developed in this paper are general and apply to other stochastic settings where a single party tries to maximize its time-average profit."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9967","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9967","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9967","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1905","fieldValue":" The need to minimize power while maximizing performance has led to recent developments of powerful superscalar designs targeted at embedded and portable use. Instruction fetch is responsible for a significant fraction of microprocessor power and energy, and is therefore an attractive target for architectural power optimization. We present novel techniques that take advantage of guarantees so that the instruction translation lookaside buffer, branch target buffer, and branch prediction buffer can frequently be disabled, reducing their energy usage, while simultaneously reducing branch predictor contention. These techniques require no changes to the instruction set and can easily be integrated into most single- and multiple-issue processors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1905","fieldValue":"ACM"}
