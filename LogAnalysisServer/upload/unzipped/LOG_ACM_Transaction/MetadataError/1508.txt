{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15592","fieldValue":" As there is no hardware support neither for rendering trimmed NURBS -- the standard surface representation in CAD -- nor for T-Spline surfaces the usability of existing rendering APIs like OpenGL, where a run-time tessellation is performed on the CPU, is limited to simple scenes. Due to the irregular mesh data structures required for trimming no algorithms exists that exploit the GPU for tessellation. Therefore, recent approaches perform a pretessellation and use level-of-detail techniques. In contrast to a simple API these methods require tedious preparation of the models before rendering and hinder interactive editing. Furthermore, due to the tremendous amount of triangle data smooth zoom-ins from long shot to close-up are not possible, In this paper we show how the trimming region can be defined by a trim-texture that is dynamically adapted to the required resolution and allows for an efficient trimming of surfaces on the GPU. Combining this new method with GPU-based tessellation of cubic rational surfaces allows a new rendering algorithm for arbitrary trimmed NURBS and T-Spline surfaces with prescribed error in screen space on the GPU. The performance exceeds current CPU-based techniques by a factor of up to 1000 and makes real-time visualization of real-world trimmed NURBS and T-Spline models possible on consumer-level graphics cards."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15592","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15592","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15593","fieldValue":" By combining depth peeling with a linear formulation of a Boolean expression called Blist, the Blister algorithm renders an arbitrary CSG model of n primitives in at most k steps, where k is the number of depth-layers in the arrangement of the primitives. Each step starts by rendering each primitive to produce candidate surfels on the next depth-layer. Then, it renders the primitives again, one at a time, to classify the candidate surfels against the primitive and to evaluate the Boolean expression directly on the GPU. Since Blist does not expand the CSG expression into a disjunctive (sum-of-products) form, Blister has O(kn) time complexity. We explain the Blist formulation while providing algorithms for CSG-to-Blist conversion and Blist-based parallel surfel classification. We report real-time performance for nontrivial CSG models. On hardware with an 8-bit stencil buffer, we can render all possible CSG expressions with 3909 primitives."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15593","fieldValue":"CSG"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15593","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15593","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15593","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15594","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a shading model for light diffusion in multi-layered translucent materials. Previous work on diffusion in translucent materials has assumed smooth semi-infinite homogeneous materials and solved for the scattering of light using a dipole diffusion approximation. This approximation breaks down in the case of thin translucent slabs and multi-layered materials. We present a new efficient technique based on multiple dipoles to account for diffusion in thin slabs. We enhance this multipole theory to account for mismatching indices of refraction at the top and bottom of of translucent slabs, and to model the effects of rough surfaces. To model multiple layers, we extend this single slab theory by convolving the diffusion profiles of the individual slabs. We account for multiple scattering between slabs by using a variant of Kubelka-Munk theory in frequency space. Our results demonstrate diffusion of light in thin slabs and multi-layered materials such as paint, paper, and human skin."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15594","fieldValue":"BSSRDF"}
