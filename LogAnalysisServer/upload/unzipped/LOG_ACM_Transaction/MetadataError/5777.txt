Recently, remarkable compression performance of individual DNA sequence from the same population is achieved by encoding its difference with a nearly identical reference sequence. Nevertheless, there is lack of general algorithms that also allow less similar reference sequences. In this work, we extend the intra-sequence to the inter-sequence similarity in that approximate matches of subsequences are found between the DNA sequence and a set of reference sequences. Hence, a set of nearly identical DNA sequences from the same population or a set of partially similar DNA sequences like chromosome sequences and DNA sequences of related species can be compressed together. For practical compressors, the compressed size is usually influenced by the compression order of sequences. Fast search algorithms for the optimal compression order are thus developed for multiple sequences compression. Experimental results on artificial and real datasets demonstrate that our proposed multiple sequences compression methods with fast compression order search are able to achieve good compression performance under different levels of similarity in the multiple DNA sequences."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5264","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5264","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5264","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5265","fieldValue":"Ou-Yang, Le"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5265","fieldValue":"Dai, Dao-Qing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5265","fieldValue":"Zhang, Xiao-Fei"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5265","fieldValue":" Identification of protein complexes is fundamental for understanding the cellular functional organization. With the accumulation of physical protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, computational detection of protein complexes from available PPI networks has drawn a lot of attentions. While most of the existing protein complex detection algorithms focus on analyzing the physical protein-protein interaction network, none of them take into account the 筐u20AC랍igns筐u20AC? (i.e., activation-inhibition relationships) of physical interactions. As the 筐u20AC랍igns筐u20AC? of interactions reflect the way proteins communicate, considering the 筐u20AC랍igns筐u20AC? of interactions can not only increase the accuracy of protein complex identification, but also deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of cell functions. In this study, we proposed a novel Signed Graph regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SGNMF) model to identify protein complexes from signed PPI networks. In our experiments, we compared the results collected by our model on signed PPI networks with those predicted by the state-of-the-art complex detection techniques on the original unsigned PPI networks. We observed that considering the 筐u20AC랍igns筐u20AC? of interactions significantly benefits the detection of protein complexes. Furthermore, based on the predicted complexes, we predicted a set of signed complex-complex interactions for each dataset, which provides a novel insight of the higher level organization of the cell.
