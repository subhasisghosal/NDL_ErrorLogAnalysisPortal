Since a single link or node failure in the physical layer can bring several logical links down, it is important to find a mapping of logical links on the physical layer that ensures the logical topology remains connected in case of physical failures. A mapping that preserves the logical-layer connectivity in case of any given failure of the physical layer is called survivable. The problem of finding a survivable mapping for single-link failure for a given logical network over a given physical network is known to be NP-complete. We show that it is also true for both single- and double-node failure. Thus, for practical applications, only scalable heuristic methods can be used. In the literature, efficient and scalable combinatorial mapping algorithms were proposed for single-or multiple-link failures and single-node failures of the physical network, which are based on specific properties of the network graphs. As a new result, in this paper we present a graph-theoretic heuristic method to find a survivable mapping for double-node failures. We also present an integer linear programming (ILP) model and evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm by comparing it to the ILP method."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10838","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10839","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose and study optimal proactive resource allocation and demand shaping for data networks. Motivated by the recent findings on the predictability of human behavior patterns in data networks, and the emergence of highly capable handheld devices, our design aims to smooth out the network traffic over time and minimize the data delivery costs. Our framework utilizes proactive data services as well as smart content recommendation schemes for shaping the demand. Proactive data services take place during the off-peak hours based on a statistical prediction of a demand profile for each user, whereas smart content recommendation assigns modified valuations to data items so as to render the users' demand less uncertain. Hence, our recommendation scheme aims to boost the performance of proactive services within the allowed flexibility of user requirements. We conduct theoretical performance analysis that quantifies the leveraged cost reduction through the proposed framework. We show that the cost reduction scales at the same rate as the cost function scales with the number of users. Furthermore, we prove that demand shaping through smart recommendation strictly reduces the incurred cost even below that of proactive downloads without recommendation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10839","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10839","fieldValue":"ACM"}
