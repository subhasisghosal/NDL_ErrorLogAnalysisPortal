Indirectly indexed arrays are those arrays which are, typically, accessed inside multilevel loop nests and whose index expression includes not only loop iterators and constants but arrays as well. Existing techniques for improving locality are quite sophisticated in the case of directly indexed arrays. But, unfortunately, they are inadequate for handling indirectly indexed arrays. In this article we therefore extend the existing framework and techniques of directly indexed to indirectly indexed arrays. The concepts of reuse subspace, dependence vector, self, and group reuse are extended and applied in this new context. Also, lately scratch-pad memory has become an attractive alternative to data-cache, specially in the embedded multimedia community. This is because embedded systems are very sensitive to area and energy and the scratch-pad is smaller in area and consumes less energy on a per access basis compared to the cache of the same capacity. Several techniques have been proposed in the past for the efficient exploitation of the scratch-pad for directly indexed arrays. We extend these techniques by presenting a method for scratch-pad mapping of indirectly indexed arrays. This enables the scratch-pad to be used in a larger context than was possible before."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12955","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12955","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12956","fieldValue":" In digital circuit design, it is typically assumed that cell delay increases with decreasing voltage and increasing temperature. This assumption is the basis of the cornering approach with cell libraries in static timing analysis (STA). However, this assumption breaks down at low supply voltages because cell delay can decrease with increasing temperature. This phenomenon is caused by a competition between mobility and threshold voltage to dominate cell delay. We refer to this phenomenon as the inverted temperature dependence (ITD). Due to ITD, it becomes very difficult to analytically determine the temperatures that maximize or minimize the delay of a cell or a path. As such, ITD has profound consequences for STA: (1) ITD essentially invalidates the approach of defining corners by independently varying voltage and temperature; (2) ITD makes it more difficult to find short paths, leading to difficulties in detecting hold time violations; and (3) the effect of ITD will worsen as supply voltages decrease and threshold voltage variations increase. This article analyzes the consequences of ITD in STA and proposes a proper handling of ITD in an industrial sign-off STA tool. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first such work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12956","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12956","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12957","fieldValue":" New three-dimensional (3D) floorplanning and thermal via planning algorithms are proposed for thermal optimization in two-stacked die integration.

Experiments results show that our approach is nine times faster with better solution quality compared to a recent published result. In addition, the thermal via planning approach is proven to be very efficient to eliminate localized hot spots directly."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12957","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12957","fieldValue":"ACM"}
