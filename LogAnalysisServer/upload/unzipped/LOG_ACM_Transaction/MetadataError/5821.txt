Especially, areas of a bleb sequence in a video are often used to distinguish two cell blebbing behaviors in hESC: dynamic and apoptotic blebbings. This paper analyzes various segmentation methods for bleb extraction in hESC videos and introduces a bio-inspired score function to improve the performance in bleb extraction. Full bleb formation consists of bleb expansion and retraction. Blebs change their size and image properties dynamically in both processes and between frames. Therefore, adaptive parameters are needed for each segmentation method. A score function derived from the change of bleb area and orientation between consecutive frames is proposed which provides adaptive parameters for bleb extraction in videos. In comparison to manual analysis, the proposed method provides an automated fast and accurate approach for bleb sequence extraction."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5344","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5345","fieldValue":" In this paper, we survey algorithms that perform global alignment of networks or graphs. Global network alignment aligns two or more given networks to find the best mapping from nodes in one network to nodes in other networks. Since graphs are a common method of data representation, graph alignment has become important with many significant applications. Protein-protein interactions can be modeled as networks and aligning these networks of protein interactions has many applications in biological research. In this survey, we review algorithms for global pairwise alignment highlighting various proposed approaches, and classify them based on their methodology. Evaluation metrics that are used to measure the quality of the resulting alignments are also surveyed. We discuss and present a comparison between selected aligners on the same datasets and evaluate using the same evaluation metrics. Finally, a quick overview of the most popular databases of protein interaction networks is presented focusing on datasets that have been used recently."}
