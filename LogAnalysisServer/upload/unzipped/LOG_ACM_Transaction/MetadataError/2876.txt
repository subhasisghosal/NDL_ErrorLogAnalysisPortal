The resulting tools are modular and include enhanced structures to deal with convection-diffusion problems, plus several projection operators and the postprocessing implementation that is necessary to realize the superconvergence property of the method. Loops over the elements are exclusively local and, as such, have been parallelized."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19412","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Universidad Cat&#243;lica de la Sant&#237;sima Concepci&#243;n, Concepci&#243;n, Chile (Gatica, Luis F); University of delaware, USA (Sayas, Francisco-javier); University of Delaware, USA (Fu, Zhixing)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19412","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19412","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19413","fieldValue":" A hierarchy of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations approximates the global optimum of polynomial optimization problems of noncommuting variables. Generating the relaxation, however, is a computationally demanding task, and only problems of commuting variables have efficient generators. We develop an implementation for problems of noncommuting variables that creates the relaxation to be solved by SDPA--a high-performance solver that runs in a distributed environment. We further exploit the inherent sparsity of optimization problems in quantum physics to reduce the complexity of the resulting relaxations. Constrained problems with a relaxation of order two may contain up to a hundred variables. The implementation is available in Python. The tool helps solve such as finding the ground state energy or testing quantum correlations."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19413","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: University of Bor&#229;s, Bor&#229;s, Sweden (Wittek, Peter)"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19413","fieldValue":"Algorithm 950: Ncpol2sdpaâ\u20AC\u201DSparse Semidefinite Programming Relaxations for Polynomial Optimization Problems of Noncommuting Variables"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19413","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19413","fieldValue":"ACM"}
