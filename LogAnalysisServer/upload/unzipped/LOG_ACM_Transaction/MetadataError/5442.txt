Surprisingly, when it comes to defining it precisely for multichromosomal genomes with both linear and circular chromosomes, there is more than one way to go about it. Pevzner and Tesler gave a definition in a 2003 paper, Tannier et al. defined it differently in 2008, and in this paper we provide yet another alternative, calling it SCJ for single-cut-or-join, in analogy to the popular double cut and join (DCJ) measure. We show that several genome rearrangement problems, such as median and halving, become easy for SCJ, and provide linear and higher polynomial time algorithms for them. For the multichromosomal linear genome median problem, this is the first polynomial time algorithm described, since for other distances this problem is NP-hard. In addition, we show that small parsimony under SCJ is also easy, and can be solved by a variant of Fitch's algorithm. In contrast, big parsimony is NP-hard under SCJ. This new distance measure may be of value as a speedily computable, first approximation to distances based on more realistic rearrangement models."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4652","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4652","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4652","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4653","fieldValue":" Comparative analysis is a topic of utmost importance in structural bioinformatics. Recently, a structural counterpart to sequence alignment, called multiple graph alignment, was introduced as a tool for the comparison of protein structures in general and protein binding sites in particular. Using approximate graph matching techniques, this method enables the identification of approximately conserved patterns in functionally related structures. In this paper, we introduce a new method for computing graph alignments motivated by two problems of the original approach, a conceptual and a computational one. First, the existing approach is of limited usefulness for structures that only share common substructures. Second, the goal to find a globally optimal alignment leads to an optimization problem that is computationally intractable. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a semiglobal approach to graph alignment in analogy to semiglobal sequence alignment that combines the advantages of local and global graph matching."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4653","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4653","fieldValue":"Approximate graph matching, protein binding sites, structure comparison, graph alignment, structural bioinformatics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4653","fieldValue":"ACM"}
