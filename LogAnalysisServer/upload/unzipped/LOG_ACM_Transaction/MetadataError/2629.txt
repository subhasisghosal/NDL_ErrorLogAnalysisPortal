They are similar to the recent methods, but together with quadratic interpolation they make essential use of inverse cubic interpolation as well. Since asymptotically the inverse cubic interpolation is always chosen by the algorithms, they achieve higher-efficiency indices: 1.6529â\u20AC¦ for the first algorithm, and 1.6686â\u20AC¦ for the second one. It is proved that the second algorithm is optimal in a certain family. Numerical experiments show that the two new methods compare well with recent methods, as well as with the efficient solvers of Dekker, Brent, Bus and Dekker, and Le. The second method from the present article has the best behavior of all 12 methods especially when the termination tolerance is small."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18829","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18829","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18830","fieldValue":" In recent years many results have been obtained in the field of the numerical inversion of Laplace transforms. Among them, a very accurate and general method is due to Talbot: this method approximates the value of the inverse Laplace transform f(t), for t fixed, using the complex values of the Laplace transform F(s) sampled on a suitable contour of the complex plane. On the basis of the interest raised by Talbot's method implementation, the author has been induced to investigate more deeply the possibilities of this method and has been able to generalize Talbot's method, to approximate simultaneously several values of f(t) using the same sampling values of the Laplace transform. In this way, the only unfavorable aspect of the classical Talbot method, that is, that of recomputing all of the samples of F(s) for each t, has been eliminated."}
