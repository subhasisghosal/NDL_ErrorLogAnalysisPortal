As such, visually impaired users, who access content through audio interaction, are hindered as the Web is not designed with their needs in mind. To compensate for this, visually impaired users develop behavioral strategies to cope when access to the content becomes challenging. While tools exist to aid visually impaired users in accessing the Web, they tend to focus on adapting content to meet the needs of the device rather than the user. Therefore, to further improve Web access an understanding of the behavioral strategies users employ is required. To achieve this, studies of eleven visually impaired Web users were conducted. The data from these sessions were analyzed to develop a framework for identifying strategies that users may employ when they face difficulties accessing the content. Using data for twenty visually impaired users obtained from an independent study, the framework was validated and shown to be flexible and accurate enough to be applicable to multiple data sources. An analysis of the coping strategies identified from the framework revealed six abstract patterns of coping. These patterns were used as the basis for developing behavior-driven transcoding that transformed static Web documents into interactive content by allowing users to navigate between key elements of the page through a consistent set of key presses. Results obtained from a user evaluation of the transcoding support the use of behavior-driven transcoding as a mechanism for improving access to Web content when compared to existing transcoding techniques. This result allows the coping strategies framework to be used as a foundation for further understanding of the strategies visually impaired users employ on Web sites and the transformations required to allow the Web to be accessible to those users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1449","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1449","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5273","fieldValue":"Wong, Ka-Chun"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5273","fieldValue":" With the prevalence of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with sequencing (ChIP-Seq) technology, massive ChIP-Seq data has been accumulated. The ChIP-Seq technology measures the genome-wide occupancy of DNA-binding proteins in vivo. It is well-known that different DNA-binding protein occupancies may result in a gene being regulated in different conditions (e.g. different cell types). To fully understand a geneâ\u20AC™s function, it is essential to develop probabilistic models on multiple ChIP-Seq profiles for deciphering the gene transcription causalities. In this work, we propose and describe two probabilistic models. Assuming the conditional independence of different DNA-binding proteinsâ\u20AC™ occupancies, the first method (SignalRanker) is developed as an intuitive method for ChIP-Seq genome-wide signal profile inference. Unfortunately, such an assumption may not always hold in some gene regulation cases. Thus, we propose and describe another method (FullSignalRanker) which does not make the conditional independence assumption. The proposed methods are compared with other existing methods on ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets, demonstrating its regression and classification ability. The results suggest that FullSignalRanker is the best-performing method for recovering the signal ranks on the promoter and enhancer regions. In addition, FullSignalRanker is also the best-performing method for peak sequence classification. We envision that SignalRanker and FullSignalRanker will become important in the era of next generation sequencing.
