However, various stations communicating with the AP often have different signal qualities, resulting in different transmission rates. This induces a phenomenon known as the rate anomaly problem, in which stations with lower signal quality transmit at lower rates and consume a significant majority of airtime, thereby dramatically reducing the throughput of stations transmitting at higher rates. We propose SoftRepeater, a practical, deployable system in which stations cooperatively address the rate anomaly problem. Specifically, higher rateWi-Fi stations opportunistically transform themselves into repeaters for lower rate stations when transmitting data to\/from the AP. The key challenge is to determine when it is beneficial to enable the repeater functionality. In view of this, we propose an initiation protocol that ensures that repeater functionality is enabled only when appropriate. Also, our system can run directly on top of today's 802.11 infrastructure networks. In addition, we describe a novel, zero-overhead network coding scheme that further alleviates undesirable symptoms of the rate anomaly problem. Using simulation and testbed implementation, we find that SoftRepeater can improve cumulative throughput by up to 200%."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9898","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9898","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9898","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9899","fieldValue":"Kim, Kyu-Han"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9899","fieldValue":" This paper presents a highly efficient and accurate link-quality measurement framework, called Efficient and Accurate link-quality monitoR (EAR), for multihop wireless mesh networks (WMNs) that has several salient features. First, it exploits three complementary measurement schemes: passive, cooperative, and active monitoring. By adopting one of these schemes dynamically and adaptively, EAR maximizes the measurement accuracy, and its opportunistic use of the unicast application traffic present in the network minimizes the measurement overhead. Second, EAR effectively identifies the existence of wireless link asymmetry by measuring the quality of each link in both directions of the link, thus improving the utilization of network capacity by up to 114%. Finally, its cross-layer architecture across both the network layer and the IEEE 802.11-based device driver makes EAR easily deployable in existing multihop wireless mesh networks without system recompilation or MAC firmware modification. EAR has been evaluated extensively via both ns-2-based simulation and experimentation on our Linux-based implementation in a real-life testbed. Both simulation and experimentation results have shown EAR to provide highly accurate link-quality measurements with minimum overhead."}
