However, the social and entertainment value and efficacy of mixed reality platforms for adult powered chair users has not been widely explored. In this article, we introduce the Mobility Games project, which aims to produce a series of inclusive entertainment technologies and services for people who use powered chairs. We describe our first offering: an accessible, social mixed reality game for co-located mobile play in everyday spaces. Findings from two exploratory field studies and a post hoc observer survey show that adult powered chair users found the game to be entertaining and used a variety of path strategies as they learned to play the game. An initial set of theoretically and empirically informed guidelines for making mobile mixed reality games accessible to adult powered chair users with diverse abilities is proposed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5933","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5933","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5935","fieldValue":" This article provides a detailed analysis of rural Kenyan women and their interactions with the products and services of Safaricom Ltd., Kenya's dominant mobile network provider. The amplification theory of technology offers a framework for analyzing our data, and we find that differential motivation and capacity are mechanisms that appear to benefit the network provider, while disadvantaging rural mobile phone owners. In particular, the design of Safaricom's airtime scratch cards and mobile services does not support rural usersâ\u20AC™ capabilities. Our analysis suggests that technologists consider their ongoing responsibilities for technologies they built yesterdayâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, they should address problems inherent in the current design of mobile-phone interfaces. We offer practical recommendations on how to do this, and ask HCI\/ICTD researchers and practitioners to more carefully consider how overlooking corporate power structures and their impact on mobile phone use amplifies social inequality."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5935","fieldValue":"ICTD"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5935","fieldValue":"ACM"}
