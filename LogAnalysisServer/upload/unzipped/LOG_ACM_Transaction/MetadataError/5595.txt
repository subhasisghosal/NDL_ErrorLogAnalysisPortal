{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4921","fieldValue":" Tree comparison functions are widely used in phylogenetics for comparing evolutionary trees. Unrooted trees can be compared with rooted trees by identifying all rootings of the unrooted tree that minimize some provided comparison function between two rooted trees. The plateau property is satisfied by the provided function, if all optimal rootings form a subtree, or plateau, in the unrooted tree, from which the rootings along every path toward a leaf have monotonically increasing costs. This property is sufficient for the linear-time identification of all optimal rootings and rooting costs. However, the plateau property has only been proven for a few rooted comparison functions, requiring individual proofs for each function without benefitting from inherent structural features of such functions. Here, we introduce the consistency condition that is sufficient for a general function to satisfy the plateau property. For consistent functions, we introduce general linear-time solutions that identify optimal rootings and all rooting costs. Further, we identify novel relationships between consistent functions in terms of plateaus, especially the plateau of the well-studied duplication-loss function is part of a plateau of every other consistent function. We introduce a novel approach for identifying consistent cost functions by defining a formal language of Boolean costs. Formulas in this language can be interpreted as cost functions. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our general linear-time solutions in practice using empirical and simulation studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4921","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4921","fieldValue":"Vegetation,Radio frequency,Cost function,Search problems,Bioinformatics,Phylogeny,IEEE transactions,formal language,Vegetation,Radio frequency,Cost function,Search problems,Bioinformatics,Phylogeny,IEEE transactions,Boolean cost,Reconciliation,unrooted gene tree,species tree,evolutionary cost,gene duplication,gene loss,speciation,deep coalescence,Robinson-Foulds distance"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4922","fieldValue":" Recent advances in high-throughput technologies for biological data acquisition have spurred a broad interest in the construction of mathematical models for biological phenomena. The development of such mathematical models relies on the estimation of unknown parameters of the system using the time-course profiles of different metabolites in the system. One of the main challenges in the parameter estimation of biological phenomena is the fact that the number of unknown parameters is much more than the number of metabolites in the system. Moreover, the available metabolite measurements are corrupted by noise. In this paper, a new parameter estimation algorithm is developed based on the stochastic estimation framework for nonlinear systems, namely the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). A new iterative UKF algorithm with covariance resetting is developed in which the UKF algorithm is applied iteratively to the available noisy time profiles of the metabolites. The proposed estimation algorithm is applied to noisy time-course data synthetically produced from a generic branched pathway as well as real time-course profile for the Cad system of E. coli. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4922","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4922","fieldValue":"Noise measurement,Parameter estimation,Mathematical model,Convergence,Estimation,Noise,Biology,unscented Kalman filter,Noise measurement,Parameter estimation,Mathematical model,Convergence,Estimation,Noise,Biology,S-systems,Biological phenomena,parameter estimation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4922","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4922","fieldValue":"ACM"}
