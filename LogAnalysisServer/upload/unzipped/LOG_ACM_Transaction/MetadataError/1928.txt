Ben-Dor et al. formulated the problem in Ben-Dor et al. [2003]. They further showed that the problem is NP-complete and provided a greedy heuristic for the problem. The complement of the OPSM problem, called MinOPSM, is to delete the least number of entries in the matrix so that the remaining submatrix is order preserving. We devise a 5-approximation algorithm for the MinOPSM based on a formulation of the problem as a quadratic, nonseparable set cover problem. An alternative formulation combined with a primal-dual algorithm improves the approximation factor to 3. The complexity of both algorithms for a matrix of size m Ã\u2014 n is $O(m^2$n). We further comment on the related biclustering problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2580","fieldValue":"Approximation Algorithms for a Minimization Variant of the Order-Preserving Submatrices and for Biclustering Problems"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2580","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2580","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16666","fieldValue":" Skinning transformations are a popular way to articulate shapes and characters. However, traditional animation interfaces require all of the skinning transformations to be specified explicitly, typically using a control structure (a rig). We propose a system where the user specifies only a subset of the degrees of freedom and the rest are automatically inferred using nonlinear, rigidity energies. By utilizing a low-order model and reformulating our energy functions accordingly, our algorithm runs orders of magnitude faster than previous methods without compromising quality. In addition to the immediate boosts in performance for existing modeling and real time animation tools, our approach also opens the door to new modes of control: disconnected skeletons combined with shape-aware inverse kinematics. With automatically generated skinning weights, our method can also be used for fast variational shape modeling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16666","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16666","fieldValue":"ACM"}
