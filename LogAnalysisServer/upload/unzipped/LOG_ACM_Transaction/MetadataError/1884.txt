{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16550","fieldValue":" We present a framework based on Genetic Programming (GP) for automatically simplifying procedural shaders. Our approach computes a series of increasingly simplified shaders that expose the inherent trade-off between speed and accuracy. Compared to existing automatic methods for pixel shader simplification [Olano et al. 2003; Pellacini 2005], our approach considers a wider space of code transformations and produces faster and more faithful results. We further demonstrate how our cost function can be rapidly evaluated using graphics hardware, which allows tens of thousands of shader variants to be considered during the optimization process. Our approach is also applicable to multi-pass shaders and perceptual-based error metrics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16551","fieldValue":" This paper presents a novel method for generating pixel-accurate shadows from point light-sources in real-time. The new method is able to quickly cull pixels that are not in shadow and to trivially accept large chunks of pixels thanks mainly to using the whole triangle shadow volume as a primitive, instead of rendering the shadow quads independently as in the classic Shadow-Volume algorithm. Our CUDA implementation outperforms z-fail consistently and surpasses z-pass at high resolutions, although these latter two are hardware accelerated, while inheriting none of the robustness issues associated with these methods. Another, perhaps even more important property of our algorithm, is that it requires no pre-processing or identification of silhouette edges and so robustly and efficiently handles arbitrary triangle soups. In terms of view sample test and set operations performed, we show that our algorithm can be an order of magnitude more efficient than z-pass when rendering a game-scene at multi-sampled HD resolutions. We go on to show that the algorithm can be trivially modified to support textured, semitransparent and colored semi-transparent shadow-casters and that it can be combined with either depth-peeling or stochastic transparency to also support transparent shadow receivers. Compared to recent alias-free shadow-map algorithms, our method has a very small memory footprint, does not suffer from load-balancing issues, and handles omni-directional lights without modification. It is easily incorporated into any deferred rendering pipeline and combines many of the strengths of shadow maps and shadow volumes."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16551","fieldValue":"An efficient alias-free shadow algorithm for opaque and transparent objects using per-triangle shadow volumes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16551","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16551","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16552","fieldValue":" The goal of this work is to find visually similar images even if they appear quite different at the raw pixel level. This task is particularly important for matching images across visual domains, such as photos taken over different seasons or lighting conditions, paintings, hand-drawn sketches, etc. We propose a surprisingly simple method that estimates the relative importance of different features in a query image based on the notion of \"data-driven uniqueness\". We employ standard tools from discriminative object detection in a novel way, yielding a generic approach that does not depend on a particular image representation or a specific visual domain. Our approach shows good performance on a number of difficult cross-domain visual tasks e.g., matching paintings or sketches to real photographs. The method also allows us to demonstrate novel applications such as Internet re-photography, and painting2gps. While at present the technique is too computationally intensive to be practical for interactive image retrieval, we hope that some of the ideas will eventually become applicable to that domain as well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16552","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16552","fieldValue":"ACM"}
