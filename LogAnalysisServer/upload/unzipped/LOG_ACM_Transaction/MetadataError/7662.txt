Jamming is difficult to mitigate in broadcast networks because transmitting and receiving are inherently symmetric operations: A user that possesses the key to decode a transmission can also use that key to jam the transmission. We describe a code tree system that provides input to the physical layer and helps the physical layer circumvent jammers. In our system, the transmitter has more information than any proper subset of receivers. Each receiver cooperates with the transmitter to detect any jamming that affects that receiver. In the resulting system, each benign user is guaranteed to eliminate the impact of the attacker after some finite number of losses with arbitrarily high probability. We show that any system that relies on only using spreading code, and no other physical factors, to mitigate jamming must use at least j + 1 codes, where j is the number of jammers. We then propose an optimized scheme that is power-efficient: Each transmission is sent on at most 2j+1 codes simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that our scheme approaches the best possible performance by performing an extensive analysis of the system using both event-driven ns-2 and chip-accurate MATLAB simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10134","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10134","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10134","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10135","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10135","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10135","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8398","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10136","fieldValue":" Interference and collisions greatly limit the throughput of mesh networks that use contention-based MAC protocols such as IEEE 802.11. Significantly higher throughput is achievable if transmissions are scheduled. However, traditional methods to compute optimal schedules are computationally intractable (unless co-channel interference is neglected). This paper presents a practical technique to compute optimal schedules. The resulting algorithm searches for a low-dimensional optimization problem that has the same solution as the full problem. Such a low-dimensional problem is shown to always exist. The resulting algorithm converges arithmetically fast or geometrically fast, depending on whether the objective is to maximize the proportional fair throughput or to maximize the minimum throughput, where the minimum is over all flows in the network. At each iteration of the algorithm, a graph-theoretic optimization known as the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem must be solved. While the general MWIS problem is NP-hard in the worst case, we find that the MWIS can be solved efficiently. Specifically, computational experiments on over 17 000 topologies indicate that the ratio of the time to solve the MWIS and the mean degree of the conflict graph grows polynomially with the number of nodes."}
