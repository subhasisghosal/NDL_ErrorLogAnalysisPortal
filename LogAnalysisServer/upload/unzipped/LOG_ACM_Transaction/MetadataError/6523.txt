A range of visualization types and control mechanisms to support knowledge discovery are presented. These include corpus- and document-specific views, iterative topic modeling, search, and visual filtering. Drill-down functionality is provided to allow analysts to visualize individual document sections and their relations within the global topic space. Analysts can search across a dataset through a set of expansion techniques on selected document and topic nodes. Furthermore, analysts can select relevant subsets of documents and perform real-time topic modeling on these subsets to interactively visualize topics at various levels of granularity, allowing for a better understanding of the documents. A discussion of the design and implementation choices for each visual analysis technique is presented. This is followed by a discussion of three diverse use cases in which TopicNets enables fast discovery of information that is otherwise hard to find. These include a corpus of 50,000 successful NSF grant proposals, 10,000 publications from a large research center, and single documents including a grant proposal and a PhD thesis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7388","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7388","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7389","fieldValue":" Over the last decade, document clustering, as one of the key tasks in information organization and navigation, has been widely studied. Many algorithms have been developed for addressing various challenges in document clustering and for improving clustering performance. However, relatively few research efforts have been reported on evaluating and understanding document clustering results. In this article, we present DClusterE, a comprehensive and effective framework for document clustering evaluation and understanding using information visualization. DClusterE integrates cluster validation with user interactions and offers rich visualization tools for users to examine document clustering results from multiple perspectives. In particular, through informative views including force-directed layout view, matrix view, and cluster view, DClusterE provides not only different aspects of document inter\/intra-clustering structures, but also the corresponding relationship between clustering results and the ground truth. Additionally, DClusterE supports general user interactions such as zoom in\/out, browsing, and interactive access of the documents at different levels. Two new techniques are proposed to implement DClusterE: (1) A novel multiplicative update algorithm (MUA) for matrix reordering to generate narrow-banded (or clustered) nonzero patterns from documents. Combined with coarse seriation, MUA is able to provide better visualization of the cluster structures. (2) A Mallows-distance-based algorithm for establishing the relationship between the clustering results and the ground truth, which serves as the basis for coloring schemes. Experiments and user studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DClusterE."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7390","fieldValue":"Zhou, Michelle X"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7390","fieldValue":" We are building an interactive visual text analysis tool that aids users in analyzing large collections of text. Unlike existing work in visual text analytics, which focuses either on developing sophisticated text analytic techniques or inventing novel text visualization metaphors, ours tightly integrates state-of-the-art text analytics with interactive visualization to maximize the value of both. In this article, we present our work from two aspects. We first introduce an enhanced, LDA-based topic analysis technique that automatically derives a set of topics to summarize a collection of documents and their content evolution over time. To help users understand the complex summarization results produced by our topic analysis technique, we then present the design and development of a time-based visualization of the results. Furthermore, we provide users with a set of rich interaction tools that help them further interpret the visualized results in context and examine the text collection from multiple perspectives. As a result, our work offers three unique contributions. First, we present an enhanced topic modeling technique to provide users with a time-sensitive and more meaningful text summary. Second, we develop an effective visual metaphor to transform abstract and often complex text summarization results into a comprehensible visual representation. Third, we offer users flexible visual interaction tools as alternatives to compensate for the deficiencies of current text summarization techniques. We have applied our work to a number of text corpora and our evaluation shows promise, especially in support of complex text analyses."}
