First a hierarchical file organization based on a linear ordering of records is presented for retrieving records highly similar to any input query. Then the spelling problem is attacked by constructing a hierarchical file for a set of strings in a dictionary of English words. The spelling correction steps proceed as follows: (1) find one of the best-match strings which are most similar to a query, (2) expand the search area for obtaining the good-match strings, and (3) interrupt the file search as soon as the required string is displayed. Computational experiments verify the performance of the proposed methods for similar-string matching under the UNIX#8482; time-sharing system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13957","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13957","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13958","fieldValue":" Researchers in artificial intelligence have recently become interested in natural language fact retrieval; currently, their research is at a point where it can begin contributing to the field of Information Retrieval. In this paper, strategies for a natural language fact retrieval system are mapped out, and approaches to many of the organization and retrieval problems are presented. The CYRUS system, which keeps track of important people and is queried in English, is presented and used to illustrate those solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13959","fieldValue":" Concurrency control is the activity of synchronizing operations issued by concurrently executing programs on a shared database. The goal is to produce an execution that has the same effect as a serial (noninterleaved) one. In a multiversion database system, each write on a data item produces a new copy (or version) of that data item. This paper presents a theory for analyzing the correctness of concurrency control algorithms for multiversion database systems. We use the theory to analyze some new algorithms and some previously published ones."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13959","fieldValue":"ACM"}
