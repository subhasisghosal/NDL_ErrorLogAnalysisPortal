Gabbay and Shehtman proved in 1998 that this problem is decidable in a tower of exponentials. So far, the best-known lower bound is NEXP-hardness shown by Marx and Mikul√°s in 2001. Our first main result closes this complexity gap. We show that satisfiability in K2 is nonelementary. More precisely, we prove that it is k-NEXP-complete, where k is the switching depth (the minimal modal rank among the two dimensions) of the input formula, hereby solving a conjecture of Marx and Mikul√°s. Using our lower-bound technique also allows us to derive nonelementary lower bounds for the two-dimensional modal logics K4 √\u2014 K and $S5_2$ √\u2014 K, for which only elementary lower bounds were previously known. Moreover, we apply our technique to prove nonelementary lower bounds for the sizes of Feferman-Vaught decompositions with respect to product for any decomposable logic that is at least as expressive as unimodal K, generalizing a recent result by the first author and Lin. For the three-variable fragment FO3 of first-order logic, we obtain the following two immediate corollaries: the size of Feferman-Vaught decompositions with respect to disjoint sum are inherently nonelementary, and equivalent formulas in Gaifman normal form are inherently nonelementary. Our second main result consists in providing effective elementary (more precisely, doubly exponential) upper bounds for the two-variable fragment FO2$ of first-order logic both for Feferman-Vaught decompositions and for equivalent formulas in Gaifman normal form."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11738","fieldValue":" A full and finitely generated Church-Rosser term rewriting system is presented that has no computable one-step, normalizing strategy; the system is both left- and right-linear.

In a typical event recognition application, however, these systems often have to deal with a significant amount of uncertainty. In this article, we address the issue of uncertainty in logic-based event recognition by extending the Event Calculus with probabilistic reasoning. Markov logic networks are a natural candidate for our logic-based formalism. However, the temporal semantics of the Event Calculus introduce a number of challenges for the proposed model. We show how and under what assumptions we can overcome these problems. Additionally, we study how probabilistic modelling changes the behaviour of the formalism, affecting its key property‚\u20AC\u201Dthe inertia of fluents. Furthermore, we demonstrate the advantages of the probabilistic Event Calculus through examples and experiments in the domain of activity recognition, using a publicly available dataset for video surveillance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11739","fieldValue":"ACM"}
