We propose a summarized representation of XML data, based on the concept of instance pattern, which can both provide succinct information and be directly queried. The physical representation of instance patterns exploits itemsets or association rules to summarize the content of XML datasets. Instance patterns may be used for (possibly partially) answering queries, either when fast and approximate answers are required, or when the actual dataset is not available, for example, it is currently unreachable. Experiments on large XML documents show that instance patterns allow a significant reduction in storage space, while preserving almost entirely the completeness of the query result. Furthermore, they provide fast query answers and show good scalability on the size of the dataset, thus overcoming the document size limitation of most current XQuery engines."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23938","fieldValue":" Eleven variants of six widely used open-source spam filters are tested on a chronological sequence of 49086 e-mail messages received by an individual from August 2003 through March 2004. Our approach differs from those previously reported in that the test set is large, comprises uncensored raw messages, and is presented to each filter sequentially with incremental feedback. Misclassification rates and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve measurements are reported, with statistical confidence intervals. Quantitative results indicate that content-based filters can eliminate 98&percnt; of spam while incurring 0.1&percnt; legitimate email loss. Qualitative results indicate that the risk of loss depends on the nature of the message, and that messages likely to be lost may be those that are less critical. More generally, our methodology has been encapsulated in a free software toolkit, which may used to conduct similar experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23938","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23938","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1247","fieldValue":" Todays' networks are becoming increasingly complex. They must provide a growing variety of services to a wide range of devices. In order to do so, they must make efficient use of modern technologies including MIMO, macrodiversity, power control, channel allocation, beamforming, and so on. In this context, the centralized management of radio resources on a large scale is rapidly becoming intractable. Distributed intelligence constitutes an increasingly attractive solution to provide network-wide self-configuration and adaptation capabilities. This article presents the design of a swarming system for autonomous power control which adapts naturally to the changing conditions of mobile networks where interference patterns are in constant flux. Empirical methods proposed by Parunak [1997] to develop MultiAgent Systems with Swarming (MASS) are applied to the current context while emphasizing the key concepts that lead to swarming (emergent behavior). A simulation-based study reveals how the system can be fine-tuned to obtain various solutions, balancing resources differently to achieve different trade-off points. Finally, it is shown that the distributed approach based on swarming is not only feasible but leads to higher global QoS levels than comparable centralized approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1247","fieldValue":"Designing and optimizing swarming in a distributed base station network: Application to power control"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1247","fieldValue":"ACM"}
