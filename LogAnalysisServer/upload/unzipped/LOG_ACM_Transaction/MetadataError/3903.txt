To support this, we used classical logic to represent partial specifications and to identify inconsistencies between them. We now present an adaptation of classical logic, which we term quasi-classical (QC) logic, that allows continued reasoning in the presence of inconsistency. The adaptation is a weakening of classical logic that prohibits all trivial derivations, but still allows all resolvants of the assumptions to be derived. Furthermore, the connectives behave in a classical manner. We then present a development called labeled QC logic that records and tracks assumptions used in reasoning. This facilitates a logical analysis of inconsistent information. We discuss that application of labeled QC logic in the analysis of multiperspective specifications. Such specifications are developed by multiple particpants who hold overlapping, often inconsistent, views of the systems they are developing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22630","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22630","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3207","fieldValue":"Hancock, Peter J B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3207","fieldValue":" EvoFIT, a computerized facial composite system is being developed as an alternative to current systems. EvoFIT faces are initially presented to a witness with random characteristics, but through a process of selection and breeding, a composite is \"evolved.\" Comparing composites constructed with E-FIT, a current system, a naming rate of 10&percnt; was found for EvoFIT and 17&percnt; for E-FIT. Analysis revealed that target age was limiting factor for EvoFIT and a second study with age-appropriate targets visible during composite construction produced a naming rate similar to E-FIT. Two more-realistic studies were conducted that involved young target faces and two current systems (E-FIT and PROfit). Composites from both of these experiments were poorly named but a significant benefit emerged for EvoFIT."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3207","fieldValue":"ACM"}
