In MOGs, rich social relationships emerge and can be used to improve gaming services such as match recommendation and game population retention, which are important for the user experience and the commercial value of the companies who run these MOGs. In this work, we focus on understanding social relationships in MOGs. We propose a graph model that is able to capture social relationships of a variety of types and strengths. We apply our model to real-world data collected from three MOGs that contain in total over ten years of behavioral history for millions of players and matches. We compare social relationships in MOGs across different game genres and with regular online social networks like Facebook. Taking match recommendation as an example application of our model, we propose SAMRA, a Socially Aware Match Recommendation Algorithm that takes social relationships into account. We show that our model not only improves the precision of traditional link prediction approaches, but also potentially helps players enjoy games to a higher extent."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8030","fieldValue":" Small changes on the structure of a graph can have a dramatic effect on its connectivity. While in the traditional graph theory, the focus is on well-defined properties of graph connectivity, such as biconnectivity, in the context of a social graph, connectivity is typically manifested by its ability to carry on social processes. In this paper, we consider the problem of adding a small set of nonexisting edges (shortcuts) in a social graph with the main objective of minimizing its characteristic path length. This property determines the average distance between pairs of vertices and essentially controls how broadly information can propagate through a network. We formally define the problem of interest, characterize its hardness and propose a novel method, path screening, which quickly identifies important shortcuts to guide the augmentation of the graph. We devise a sampling-based variant of our method that can scale up the computation in larger graphs. The claims of our methods are formally validated. Through experiments on real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that our methods are a multitude of times faster than standard approaches, their accuracy outperforms sensible baselines and they can ease the spread of information in a network, for a varying range of conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8031","fieldValue":" Recommender systems have been studied comprehensively in both academic and industrial fields over the past decade. As user interests can be affected by context at any time and any place in mobile scenarios, rich context information becomes more and more important for personalized context-aware recommendations. Although existing context-aware recommender systems can make context-aware recommendations to some extent, they suffer several inherent weaknesses: (1) Usersâ\u20AC™ context-aware interests are not modeled realistically, which reduces the recommendation quality; (2) Current context-aware recommender systems ignore trust relations among users. Trust relations are actually context-aware and associated with certain aspects (i.e., categories of items) in mobile scenarios. In this article, we define a term role to model common context-aware interests among a group of users. We propose an efficient role mining algorithm to mine roles from a â\u20ACœuser-context-behaviorâ\u20AC? matrix, and a role-based trust model to calculate context-aware trust value between two users. During online recommendation, given a user u in a context c, an efficient weighted set similarity query (WSSQ) algorithm is designed to build uâ\u20AC™s role-based trust network in context c. Finally, we make recommendations to u based on uâ\u20AC™s role-based trust network by considering both context-aware roles and trust relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our recommendation approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8031","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8031","fieldValue":"ACM"}
