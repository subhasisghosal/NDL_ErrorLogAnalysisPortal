{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4791","fieldValue":" Identification of essential proteins is key to understanding the minimal requirements for cellular life and important for drug design. The rapid increase of available protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has made it possible to detect protein essentiality on network level. A series of centrality measures have been proposed to discover essential proteins based on network topology. However, most of them tended to focus only on the location of singleprotein, but ignored the relevance between interactions and protein essentiality. In this paper, a new centrality measure for identifying essential proteins based on edge clustering coefficient, named as NC, is proposed. Different from previous centrality measures, NC considers both the centrality of a node and the relationship between it and its neighbors. For each interaction in the network, we calculate its edge clustering coefficient. A node's essentiality is determined by the sum of the edge clustering coefficients of interactions connecting it and its neighbors. The new centrality measure NC takes into account the modular nature of protein essentiality. NC is applied to three different types of yeast protein-protein interaction networks, which are obtained from the DIP database, the MIPS database and the BioGRID database, respectively. The experimental results on the three different networks show that the number of essential proteins discovered by NC universally exceeds that discovered by the six other centrality measures: DC, BC, CC, SC, EC, and IC. Moreover, the essential proteins discovered by NC show significant cluster effect."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4791","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4791","fieldValue":"Essential proteins, protein interaction network, topology, centrality measures, edge clustering coefficient."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4792","fieldValue":"Jang, Woo-Hyuk"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4792","fieldValue":"Jung, Suk-Hoon"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4792","fieldValue":"Han, Dong-Soo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4792","fieldValue":" Recently, several domain-based computational models for predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been proposed. The conventional methods usually infer domain or domain combination (DC) interactions from already known interacting sets of proteins, and then predict PPIs using the information. However, the majority of these models often have limitations in providing detailed information on which domain pair (single domain interaction) or DC pair (multidomain interaction) will actually interact for the predicted protein interaction. Therefore, a more comprehensive and concrete computational model for the prediction of PPIs is needed. We developed a computational model to predict PPIs using the information of intraprotein domain cohesion and interprotein DC coupling interaction. A method of identifying the primary interacting DC pair was also incorporated into the model in order to infer actual participants in a predicted interaction. Our method made an apparent improvement in the PPI prediction accuracy, and the primary interacting DC pair identification was valid specifically in predicting multidomain protein interactions. In this paper, we demonstrate that 1) the intraprotein domain cohesion is meaningful in improving the accuracy of domain-based PPI prediction, 2) a prediction model incorporating the intradomain cohesion enables us to identify the primary interacting DC pair, and 3) a hybrid approach using the intra\/interdomain interaction information can lead to a more accurate prediction."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4792","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
