OCB encrypts-and-authenticates a nonempty string M &in; &lcub;0, 1&rcub;* using ‚åà&vertbar;M&vertbar;\/n‚å\u2030 + 2 block-cipher invocations, where n is the block length of the underlying block cipher. Additional overhead is small. OCB refines a scheme, IAPM, suggested by Charanjit Jutla. Desirable properties of OCB include the ability to encrypt a bit string of arbitrary length into a ciphertext of minimal length, cheap offset calculations, cheap key setup, a single underlying cryptographic key, no extended-precision addition, a nearly optimal number of block-cipher calls, and no requirement for a random IV. We prove OCB secure, quantifying the adversary's ability to violate the mode's privacy or authenticity in terms of the quality of its block cipher as a pseudorandom permutation (PRP) or as a strong PRP, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22155","fieldValue":"AES"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22155","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22155","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22156","fieldValue":"Ahn, Gail-Joon"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22156","fieldValue":"Chu, Bei-Tseng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22156","fieldValue":" Delegation is the process whereby an active entity in a distributed environment authorizes another entity to access resources. In today's distributed systems, a user often needs to act on another user's behalf with some subset of his\/her rights. Most systems have attempted to resolve such delegation requirements with ad-hoc mechanisms by compromising existing disorganized policies or simply attaching additional components to their applications. Still, there is a strong need in the large, distributed systems for a mechanism that provides effective privilege delegation and revocation management. This paper describes a rule-based framework for role-based delegation and revocation. The basic idea behind a role-based delegation is that users themselves may delegate role authorities to others to carry out some functions authorized to the former. We present a role-based delegation model called RDM2000 (role-based delegation model 2000) supporting hierarchical roles and multistep delegation. Different approaches for delegation and revocation are explored. A rule-based language for specifying and enforcing policies on RDM2000 is proposed. We describe a proof-of-concept prototype implementation of RDM2000 to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework and provide secure protocols for managing delegations. The prototype is a web-based application for law enforcement agencies allowing reliable delegation and revocation. The future directions are also discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3113","fieldValue":" A rule-based pre-ordering approach is proposed for statistical Japanese-to-English machine translation using the dependency structure of source-side sentences. A Japanese sentence is pre-ordered to an English-like order at the morpheme level for a statistical machine translation system during the training and decoding phase to resolve the reordering problem. In this article, extra-chunk pre-ordering of morphemes is proposed, which allows Japanese functional morphemes to move across chunk boundaries. This contrasts with the intra-chunk reordering used in previous approaches, which restricts the reordering of morphemes within a chunk. Linguistically oriented discussions show that correct pre-ordering cannot be realized without extra-chunk movement of morphemes. The proposed approach is compared with five rule-based pre-ordering approaches designed for Japanese-to-English translation and with a language independent statistical pre-ordering approach on a standard patent dataset and on a news dataset obtained by crawling Internet news sites. Two state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems, one phrase-based and the other hierarchical phrase-based, are used in experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the compared approaches on automatic reordering measures (Kendall‚\u20ACôs œ\u201E, Spearman‚\u20ACôs œ?, fuzzy reordering score, and test set RIBES) and on the automatic translation precision measure of test set BLEU score."}
