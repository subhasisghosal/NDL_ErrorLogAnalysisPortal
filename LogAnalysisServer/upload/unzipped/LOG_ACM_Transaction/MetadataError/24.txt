The latter is optimal under the independent reference model of programs, which does not hold for last-level caches (LLC). PRP requires 7&percnt; and 2&percnt; metadata overheads in the cache and DRAM respectively. Using a sampling scheme makes DRAM overhead negligible, with minimal performance impact. Including detailed overhead modeling and equal cache areas, PRP outperforms SHiP, a state-of-the-art LLC replacement algorithm, by 4&percnt; for memory-intensive SPEC-CPâ\u20AC\u2020 benchmarks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11029","fieldValue":" This paper introduces Î¼-NET, a microfluidic LAN that supports the exchange of both digital information and biochemical information carried by droplets moving across molecular processors in a microfluidic chip. The Î¼-NET can be used to support molecular biology applications like DNA, RNA, and protein biosynthesis. The Î¼-NET is the first realization of a microfluidic networking paradigm that controls movements of droplets in microfluidic chips by exploiting hydrodynamic phenomena only and builds on recent solutions to achieve communications in the microfluidic domain. The Î¼-NET integrates techniques to represent addressing information, as well as switching and medium access control solutions. In fact, in Î¼-NET, the address of the molecular processor where a droplet should be sent to is encoded into the distance between droplets; switching is executed to steer the droplets inside the microfluidic device; medium access control is applied to avoid collisions between droplets that may result in their fusion and, thus, loss of the biochemical information. In this paper, the design of Î¼-NET is presented in detail, and simulation results validating Î¼-NET operations are shown."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11029","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11030","fieldValue":"Chuah, Chen-Nee"}
