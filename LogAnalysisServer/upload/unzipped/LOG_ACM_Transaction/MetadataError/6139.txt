If analysis of electromagnetic (EM) waves emanating from the wireless device during a cryptographic computation do leak sufficient information, it may be possible for an attacker to reconstruct the secret key. Possession of the secret cryptographic key would render all future wireless communications insecure and cause further potential problems, such as identity theft. Despite the complexities of a PDA wireless device, such as operating system events, interrupts, cache misses, and other interfering events, this article demonstrates that, for the first time, repeatable EM differential attacks are possible. The proposed differential analysis methodology involves precharacterization of the PDA device (thresholding and pattern recognition), and a new frequency-based differential analysis. Unlike previous research, the new methodology does not require perfect alignment of EM frames and is repeatable in the presence of a complex embedded system (including cache misses, operating system events, etc), thus supporting attacks on real embedded systems. This research is important for future wireless embedded systems, which will increasingly demand higher levels of security."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6382","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6382","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/1533","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"January 2012\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1570\",\"title\":\"Issue 4(HIPEAC Papers), January 2012\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"October 2011\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1569\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, October 2011\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"July 2011\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1568\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, July 2011\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"April 2011\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1567\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, April 2011\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6383","fieldValue":" We present a formal approach to implement fault-tolerance in real-time embedded systems. The initial fault-intolerant system consists of a set of independent periodic tasks scheduled onto a set of fail-silent processors connected by a reliable communication network. We transform the tasks such that, assuming the availability of an additional spare processor, the system tolerates one failure at a time (transient or permanent). Failure detection is implemented using heartbeating, and failure masking using checkpointing and rollback. These techniques are described and implemented by automatic program transformations on the tasks' programs. The proposed formal approach to fault-tolerance by program transformations highlights the benefits of separation of concerns. It allows us to establish correctness properties and to compute optimal values of parameters to minimize fault-tolerance overhead. We also present an implementation of our method, to demonstrate its feasibility and its efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6383","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6383","fieldValue":"ACM"}
