The generic optimum universal switch block design problem is to design a (k, W)-USB with the minimum number of switches for every pair of (k, W). This problem was first proposed and solved for k&equals;4 in Chang et al. [1996], and then solved for even W or for kâ\u2030¤6 in Shuy et al. [2000] and Fan et al. [2002b]. No optimum (k, W)-USB is known for kâ\u2030¥7 and odd Wâ\u2030¥3. But it is already known that when W is a large odd number, a near-optimum (k, W)-USB can be obtained by a disjoint union of $(Wâˆ\u2019f_2(k))\/2 copies of the optimum (k, 2)-USB and a noncompound (k, f2(k))-USB, where the value of f2(k) is unknown for kâ\u2030¥8. In this article, we show that f2(k) &equals; k&plus;3âˆ\u2019i\/3, where 1â\u2030¤iâ\u2030¤6 and iâ\u2030¡ k (mod 6), and present an explicit design for the noncompound (k, f2$(k))-USB. Combining these two results we obtain the exact designs of (k, W)-USBs for all kâ\u2030¥7 and odd Wâ\u2030¥3. The new (k, W)-USB designs also yield an efficient detailed routing algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13004","fieldValue":"Hsu, Chia-Jui"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13004","fieldValue":"Ko, Ming-Yung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13004","fieldValue":" System-level modeling, simulation, and synthesis using electronic design automation (EDA) tools are key steps in the design process for communication and signal processing systems, and the synchronous dataflow (SDF) model of computation is widely used in EDA tools for these purposes. Behavioral representations of modern wireless communication systems typically result in critical SDF graphs: These consist of hundreds of components (or more) and involve complex intercomponent connections with highly multirate relationships (i.e., with large variations in average rates of data transfer or component execution across different subsystems). Simulating such systems using conventional SDF scheduling techniques generally leads to unacceptable simulation time and memory requirements on modern workstations and high-end PCs. In this article, we present a novel simulation-oriented scheduler (SOS) that strategically integrates several techniques for graph decomposition and SDF scheduling to provide effective, joint minimization of time and memory requirements for simulating critical SDF graphs. We have implemented SOS in the advanced design system (ADS) from Agilent Technologies. Our results from this implementation demonstrate large improvements in simulating real-world, large-scale, and highly multirate wireless communication systems (e.g., 3GPP, Bluetooth, 802.16e, CDMA 2000, XM radio, EDGE, and Digital TV)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13004","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13004","fieldValue":"ACM"}
