{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10718","fieldValue":" Privacy and information security in general are major concerns that impede enterprise adaptation of shared or public cloud computing. Specifically, the concern of virtual machine (VM) physical co-residency stems from the threat that hostile tenants can leverage various forms of side channels (such as cache covert channels) to exfiltrate sensitive information of victims on the same physical system. However, on virtualized x86 systems, covert channel attacks have not yet proven to be practical, and thus the threat is widely considered a \"potential risk.\" In this paper, we present a novel covert channel attack that is capable of high-bandwidth and reliable data transmission in the cloud. We first study the application of existing cache channel techniques in a virtualized environment and uncover their major insufficiency and difficulties. We then overcome these obstacles by: 1) redesigning a pure timing-based data transmission scheme, and 2) exploiting the memory bus as a high-bandwidth covert channel medium. We further design and implement a robust communication protocol and demonstrate realistic covert channel attacks on various virtualized x86 systems. Our experimental results show that covert channels do pose serious threats to information security in the cloud. Finally, we discuss our insights on covert channel mitigation in virtualized environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10718","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10718","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10718","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10719","fieldValue":"Li, Chih-Ping"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10719","fieldValue":" We consider utility maximization in networks where the sources do not employ flow control and may consequently overload the network. In the absence of flow control at the sources, some packets will inevitably have to be dropped when the network is in overload. To that end, we first develop a distributed, thresholdbased packet-dropping policy that maximizes the weighted sum throughput. Next, we consider utility maximization and develop a receiver-based flow control scheme that, when combined with threshold-based packet dropping, achieves the optimal utility. The flow control scheme creates virtual queues at the receivers as a push-back mechanism to optimize the amount of data delivered to the destinations via back-pressure routing. A new feature of our scheme is that a utility function can be assigned to a collection of flows, generalizing the traditional approach of optimizing per-flow utilities. Our control policies use finite-buffer queues and are independent of arrival statistics. Their near-optimal performance is proved and further supported by simulation results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10719","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10719","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10719","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10720","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study the design of joint flowrate control and scheduling policies in multihop wireless networks for achieving maximum network utility with provably optimal convergence speed. Fast convergence is especially important in wireless networks that are dominated by the dynamics of incoming and outgoing flows as well as the time-sensitive applications. Yet, the design of fast converging policies in wireless networks is complicated by: 1) the interference-constrained communication capabilities, and 2) the finite set of transmission rates to select from due to operational and physical-layer constraints. We tackle these challenges by explicitly incorporating such discrete constraints to understand their impact on the convergence speed at which the running average of the received service rates and the network utility over a finite time horizon converges to their limits. In particular, we establish a fundamental fact that the convergence speed of any feasible policy cannot be faster than under both the rate and utility metrics. Then, we develop an algorithm that achieves this optimal convergence speed in both metrics. We also show that the well-known dual algorithm can achieve the optimal convergence speed in terms of its utility value. These results reveal the interesting fact that the convergence speed of rates and utilities in wireless networks is dominated by the discrete choices of scheduling and transmission rates, which also implies that the use of higher-order flow-rate controllers with fast convergence guarantees cannot overcome the aforementioned fundamental limitation."}
