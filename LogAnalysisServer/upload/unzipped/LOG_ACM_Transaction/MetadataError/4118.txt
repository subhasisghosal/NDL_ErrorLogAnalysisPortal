{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23271","fieldValue":" The popularity of Social Networking Sites (SNS) is growing rapidly, with the largest sites serving hundreds of millions of users and their private information. The privacy settings of these SNSs do not allow the user to avoid sharing some information (e.g., name and profile picture) with all the other users. Also, no matter the privacy settings, this information is always shared with the SNS (that could sell this information or be hacked). To mitigate these threats, we recently introduced the concept of Virtual Private Social Networks (VPSNs). In this work we propose the first complete architecture and implementation of VPSNs for Facebook. In particular, we address an important problem left unexplored in our previous researchâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is the automatic propagation of updated profiles to all the members of the same VPSN. Furthermore, we made an in-depth study on performance and implemented several optimization to reduce the impact of VPSN on user experience. The proposed solution is lightweight, completely distributed, does not depend on the collaboration from Facebook, does not have a central point of failure, it offers (with some limitations) the same functionality as Facebook, and apart from some simple settings, the solution is almost transparent to the user. Thorough experiments, with an extended set of parameters, we have confirmed the feasibility of the proposal and have shown a very limited time-overhead experienced by the user while browsing Facebook pages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23272","fieldValue":"Cambazoglu, B Barla"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23272","fieldValue":" In a shared-nothing, distributed text retrieval system, queries are processed over an inverted index that is partitioned among a number of index servers. In practice, the index is either document-based or term-based partitioned. This choice is made depending on the properties of the underlying hardware infrastructure, query traffic distribution, and some performance and availability constraints. In query processing on retrieval systems that adopt a term-based index partitioning strategy, the high communication overhead due to the transfer of large amounts of data from the index servers forms a major performance bottleneck, deteriorating the scalability of the entire distributed retrieval system. In this work, to alleviate this problem, we propose a novel inverted index partitioning model that relies on hypergraph partitioning. In the proposed model, concurrently accessed index entries are assigned to the same index servers, based on the inverted index access patterns extracted from the past query logs. The model aims to minimize the communication overhead that will be incurred by future queries while maintaining the computational load balance among the index servers. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model through extensive experiments using a real-life text collection and a search query sample. Our results show that considerable performance gains can be achieved relative to the term-based index partitioning strategies previously proposed in literature. In most cases, however, the performance remains inferior to that attained by document-based partitioning."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23272","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23272","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3270","fieldValue":" The ability to judge heading (direction of travel) has been the focus of much research, but a role for perceived heading in steering has not been firmly established. Subjects steered down a road consisting of straight and curved segments and made heading judgments along the way. Heading judgments while traversing curved road segments were biased in the direction of the curve by up to 5Â° and position errors on the same curved roads were highly correlated with heading biases. This correlation was revealed by the simultaneous measurement of steering performance and perceived heading."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3270","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3270","fieldValue":"ACM"}
