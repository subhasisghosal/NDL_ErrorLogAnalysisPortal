Time reconstruction methods aim to reconstruct the global time with respect to a reference clock. To achieve microsecond accuracy, MAC-layer timestamping is required for recording packet transmission and reception times. The timestamps, however, can be invalid due to multiple reasons, such as imperfect system designs, wireless corruptions, or timing attacks, etc. In this paper, we propose ART, an accurate and robust time reconstruction approach to detecting invalid timestamps and recovering the needed information. ART is much more accurate and robust than threshold-based approach, especially in dynamic networks with inherently varying propagation delays. We evaluate our approach in both testbed and a real-world deployment. Results show that: 1 ART achieves a high detection accuracy with low false-positive rate and low false-negative rate; 2 ART achieves a high recovery accuracy of less than 2 ms on average, much more accurate than previously reported results."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11018","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab. of Service Robot, Zhejiang Univ., Hangzhou, China (Wei Dong; Jie Yu; Xuefeng Zhang; Yi Gao; Chun Chen; Jiajun Bu); Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Service Robot, College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, China (Dong, Wei; Yu, Jie; Zhang, Xuefeng; Gao, Yi; Chen, Chun; Bu, Jiajun); Sch. of Software &amp; Tsinghua Nat.

Video adaptation algorithms in the existing HAS systems are either too sluggish to respond to congestion level shifts or too sensitive to short-term network bandwidth variations. Both degrade user video experience. In this paper, we formally study the tradeoff between responsiveness and smoothness in HAS through analysis and experiments. We show that client-side buffered video time is a good feedback signal to guide video adaptation. We then propose novel video rate control algorithms that balance the needs for video rate smoothness and high bandwidth utilization. We show that a small video rate margin can lead to much improved smoothness in video rate and buffer size. We also propose HAS designs that can work with multiple servers and wireless connections. We develop a fully functional HAS system and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments on a network testbed and the Internet. We demonstrate that our HAS designs are highly efficient and robust in realistic network environment."}
