It is based on a modified Shepard method similar to that of Algorithm 660 but uses 10-parameter cosine series nodal functions in place of quadratic polynomials. Also, the interpolant has continuous second partial derivatives. An accompanying survey article presents test results that show the method to be more accurate than polynomial-based methods in terms of reproducing test functions with large variations and steep gradients."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18938","fieldValue":" We present results of accuracy tests on scattered-data fitting methods that have been published as ACM algorithms. The algorithms include seven triangulation-based methods and three modified Shepard methods, two of which are new algorithms. Our purpose is twofold: to guide potential users in the selection of an appropriate algorithm and to provide a test suite for assessing the accuracy of new methods (or existing methods that are not included in this survey). Our test suite consists of five sets of nodes, with nodes counts ranging from 25 to 100, and 10 test functions. These are made available in the form of three Fortran subroutines: TESTDT returns one of the node sets; TSTFN1 returns a value and, optionally, a gradient value, of one of the test funciton; and TSTFN2 returns a value, first partials, and second partial derivatives of one of the test functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18938","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18938","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18939","fieldValue":" The curve-fitting package TSPACK has been converted to double precision.
