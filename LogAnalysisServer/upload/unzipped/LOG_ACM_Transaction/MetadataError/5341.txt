This paper explores a data fusion approach to clustering microarray data. Our method, which combined expression data and Gene Ontology (GO)-derived information, is applied on a real data set to perform genome-wide clustering. A set of novel tools is proposed to validate the clustering results and pick a fair value of infusion coefficient. These tools measure stability, biological relevance, and distance from the expression-only clustering solution. Our results indicate that a data-fusion clustering leads to more stable, biologically relevant clusters that are still representative of the experimental data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4466","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4466","fieldValue":"Clustering expression data, Gene Ontology, genomic data fusion, semantic similarity, cluster stability, knowledge-based validation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4467","fieldValue":"Huang, Min-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4467","fieldValue":"Luengo Hendriks, Cris L."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_MULTIPLE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4467","fieldValue":"Keranen, Soile V  E"}
