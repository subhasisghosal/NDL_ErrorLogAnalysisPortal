{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23775","fieldValue":" Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems only allow users access to documents that match their current query, and therefore, users can only give relevance feedback on matching documents (or those with a matching strength greater than a set threshold. This article shows that, in systems that allow access to nonmatching documents (e.g., hybrid hypertext and information retrieval systems), the strength of the effect of giving relevance feedback varies between matching and nonmatching documents. For positive feedback the results shown here are encouraging, as they can be justified by an intuitive view of the process. However, for negative feedback the results show behavior that cannot easily be justified and that varies greatly depending on the model of feedback used."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23776","fieldValue":" Efforts to place vast information resources at the fingertips of each individual in large user populations must be balanced by commensurate attention to information protection. For distributed systems with less-structured tasks, more-diversified information, and a heterogeneous user set, the computing system must administer enterprise-chosen access control policies. One kind of resource is a digital library that emulates massive collections of paper and other physical media for clerical, engineering, and cultural applications. This article considers the security requirements for such libraries and proposes an access control method that mimics organizational practice by combining a subject tree with ad hoc role granting that controls privileges for many operations independently, that treats (all but one) privileged roles (e.g., auditor, security officer) like every other individual authorization, and that binds access control information to objects indirectly for scaling, flexibility, and reflexive protection. We sketch a realization and show that it will perform well, generalizes many deployed proposed access control policies, and permits individual data centers to implement other models economically and without disruption."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23777","fieldValue":" Search engines are among the most useful and high-profile resources on the Internet. The problem of finding information on the Internet has been replaced with the problem of knowing where search engines are, what they are designed to retrieve, and how to use them. This article describes and evaluates SavvySearch, a metasearch engine designed to intelligently select and interface with multiple remote search engines. The primary metasearch issue examined is the importance of carefully selecting and ranking remote search engines for user queries. We studied the efficacy of SavvySearch's incrementally acquired metaindex approach to selecting search engines by analyzing the effect of time and experience on performance. We also compared the metaindex approach to the simpler categorical approach and showed how much experience is required to surpass the simple scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23777","fieldValue":"WWW"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23777","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23777","fieldValue":"ACM"}
