In this paper, we focus on the problem of question retrieval. Question retrieval in CQA can automatically find the most relevant and recent questions that have been solved by other users. However, the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems bring about new challenges for question retrieval in CQA. State-of-the-art approaches address these issues by implicitly expanding the queried questions with additional words or phrases using monolingual translation models. While useful, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependent on the availability of quality parallel monolingual corpora (e.g., question--answer pairs) in the absence of which they are troubled by noise issues. In this work, we propose an alternative way to address the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems by taking advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages. Our proposed method employs statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval and enriches the question representation with the translated words from other languages via non-negative matrix factorization. Experiments conducted on real CQA data sets show that our proposed approach is promising."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4062","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4062","fieldValue":"Learning the multilingual translation representations for question retrieval in community question answering via non-negative matrix factorization"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4063","fieldValue":" This paper presents a new feature extraction algorithm called power normalized Cepstral coefficients (PNCC) that is motivated by auditory processing. Major new features of PNCC processing include the use of a power-law nonlinearity that replaces the traditional log nonlinearity used in MFCC coefficients, a noise-suppression algorithm based on asymmetric filtering that suppresses background excitation, and a module that accomplishes temporal masking. We also propose the use of medium-time power analysis in which environmental parameters are estimated over a longer duration than is commonly used for speech, as well as frequency smoothing. Experimental results demonstrate that PNCC processing provides substantial improvements in recognition accuracy compared to MFCC and PLP processing for speech in the presence of various types of additive noise and in reverberant environments, with only slightly greater computational cost than conventional MFCC processing, and without degrading the recognition accuracy that is observed while training and testing using clean speech. PNCC processing also provides better recognition accuracy in noisy environments than techniques such as vector Taylor series (VTS) and the ETSI advanced front end (AFE) while requiring much less computation. We describe an implementation of PNCC using \"online processing\" that does not require future knowledge of the input."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4063","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}
