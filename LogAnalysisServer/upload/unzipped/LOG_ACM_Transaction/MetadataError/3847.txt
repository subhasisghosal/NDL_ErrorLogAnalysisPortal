Existing stylometry research assumes that authors have not attempted to disguise their linguistic writing style. We challenge this basic assumption of existing stylometry methodologies and present a new area of research: adversarial stylometry. Adversaries have a devastating effect on the robustness of existing classification methods. Our work presents a framework for creating adversarial passages including obfuscation, where a subject attempts to hide her identity, and imitation, where a subject attempts to frame another subject by imitating his writing style, and translation where original passages are obfuscated with machine translation services. This research demonstrates that manual circumvention methods work very well while automated translation methods are not effective. The obfuscation method reduces the techniques' effectiveness to the level of random guessing and the imitation attempts sì³®d up to 67&percnt; of the time depending on the stylometry technique used. These results are more significant given the fact that experimental subjects were unfamiliar with stylometry, were not professional writers, and spent little time on the attacks. This article also contributes to the field by using human subjects to empirically validate the claim of high accuracy for four current techniques (without adversaries). We have also compiled and released two corpora of adversarial stylometry texts to promote research in this field with a total of 57 unique authors. We argue that this field is important to a multidisciplinary approach to privacy, security, and anonymity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3134","fieldValue":"Nguyen, Long H B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3134","fieldValue":" In isolated languages, such as Chinese and Vietnamese, words are not separated by spaces, and a word may be formed by one or more syllables. Therefore, word segmentation (WS) is usually the first process that is implemented in the machine translation process. WS in the source and target languages is based on different training corpora, and WS approaches may not be the same. Therefore, the WS that results in these two languages are not often homologous, and thus word alignment results in many 1-n and n-1 alignment pairs in statistical machine translation, which degrades the performance of machine translation. In this article, we will adjust the WS for both Chinese and Vietnamese in particular and for isolated language pairs in general and make the word boundary of the two languages more symmetric in order to strengthen 1-1 alignments and enhance machine translation performance. We have tested this method on the Computational Linguistics Centerâ\u20AC™s corpus, which consists of 35,623 sentence pairs. The experimental results show that our method has significantly improved the performance of machine translation compared to the baseline translation system, WS translation system, and anchor language-based WS translation systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3134","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3134","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22362","fieldValue":" Separation of Duties (SoD) aims at preventing fraud and errors by distributing tasks and associated authorizations among multiple users. Li and Wang [2008] proposed an algebra (SoDA) for specifying SoD requirements, which is both expressive in the requirements it formalizes and abstract in that it is not bound to a workflow model. In this article, we bridge the gap between the specification of SoD constraints modeled in SoDA and their enforcement in a dynamic, service-oriented enterprise environment. We proceed by generalizing SoDA's semantics to traces, modeling workflow executions that satisfy the respective SoDA terms. We then refine the set of traces induced by a SoDA term to also account for a workflow's control-flow and role-based authorizations. Our formalization, which is based on the process algebra CSP, supports the enforcement of SoD on general workflows and handles changing role assignments during workflow execution, addressing a well-known source of fraud. The resulting CSP model serves as blueprint for a distributed and loosely coupled architecture where SoD enforcement is provisioned as a service. This concept, which we call SoD as a Service, facilitates a separation of concerns between business experts and security professionals. As a result, integration and configuration efforts are minimized and enterprises can quickly adapt to organizational, regulatory, and technological changes. We describe an implementation of SoD as a Service, which combines commercial components such as a workflow engine with newly developed components such as an SoD enforcement monitor. To evaluate our design decisions and to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we present a case study of a drug dispensation workflow deployed in a hospital."}
