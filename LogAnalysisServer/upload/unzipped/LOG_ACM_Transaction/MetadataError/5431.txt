This task can become challenging for proteins isolated in their own network or those with poor or uncharacterized neighborhoods. Here, we present a novel probabilistic chain-graph-based approach for predicting protein functions that builds on connecting networks of two (or more) different species by links of high interspecies sequence homology. In this way, proteins are able to â\u20ACœexchangeâ\u20AC? functional information with their neighbors-homologs from a different species. The knowledge of interspecies relationships, such as the sequence homology, can become crucial in cases of limited information from other sources of data, including the protein-protein interactions or cellular locations of proteins. We further enhance our model to account for the Gene Ontology dependencies by linking multiple but related functional ontology categories within and across multiple species. The resulting networks are of significantly higher complexity than most traditional protein network models. We comprehensively benchmark our method by applying it to two largest protein networks, the Yeast and the Fly. The joint Fly-Yeast network provides substantial improvements in precision, accuracy, and false positive rate over networks that consider either of the sources in isolation. At the same time, the new model retains the computational efficiency similar to that of the simpler networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4630","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4630","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4630","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4631","fieldValue":" A rooted acyclic digraph N with labeled leaves displays a tree T when there exists a way to select a unique parent of each hybrid vertex resulting in the tree T. Let Tr(N) denote the set of all trees displayed by the network N. In general, there may be many other networks M, such that Tr(M) = Tr(N). A network is regular if it is isomorphic with its cover digraph. If N is regular and {\\cal D} is a collection of trees displayed by N, this paper studies some procedures to try to reconstruct N given {\\cal D}. If the input is {\\cal D}=Tr(N), one procedure is described, which will reconstruct N. Hence, if N and M are regular networks and Tr(N) = Tr(M), it follows that N = M, proving that a regular network is uniquely determined by its displayed trees. If {\\cal D} is a (usually very much smaller) collection of displayed trees that satisfies certain hypotheses, modifications of the procedure will still reconstruct N given {\\cal D}."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4631","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4631","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4631","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4632","fieldValue":" Knowledge of the shape of crystals can benefit data collection in X-ray crystallography. A preliminary step is the determination of the loop object, i.e., the shape of the loop holding the crystal. Based on the standard set-up of experimental X-ray stations for protein crystallography, the paper reviews a reconstruction method merely requiring 2D object contours and presents a dedicated novel algorithm. Properties of the object surface (e.g., texture) and depth information do not have to be considered. The complexity of the reconstruction task is significantly reduced by slicing the 3D object into parallel 2D cross-sections. The shape of each cross-section is determined using support lines forming polygons. The slicing technique allows the reconstruction of concave surfaces perpendicular to the direction of projection. In spite of the low computational complexity, the reconstruction method is resilient to noisy object projections caused by imperfections in the image-processing system extracting the contours. The algorithm developed here has been successfully applied to the reconstruction of shapes of loop objects in X-ray crystallography."}
