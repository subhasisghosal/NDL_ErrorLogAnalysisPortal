{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17653","fieldValue":" Light-field cameras offer new imaging possibilities compared to conventional digital cameras. However, the additional angular domain of light fields prohibits direct application of frequently used image processing algorithms, such as warping, retargeting, or stitching. We present a general and efficient framework for nonuniform light-field warping, which forms the basis for extending many of these image processing techniques to light fields. It propagates arbitrary spatial deformations defined in one light-field perspective consistently to all other perspectives by means of 4D patch matching instead of relying on explicit depth reconstruction. This allows processing light-field recordings of complex scenes with non-Lambertian properties such as transparency and refraction. We show application examples of our framework in panorama light-field imaging, light-field retargeting, and artistic manipulation of light fields."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17653","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17653","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17654","fieldValue":" This article introduces a method that generates a hexahedral-dominant mesh from an input tetrahedral mesh. It follows a three-step pipeline similar to the one proposed by Carrier Baudoin et al.: (1) generate a frame field, (2) generate a pointset P that is mostly organized on a regular grid locally aligned with the frame field, and (3) generate the hexahedral-dominant mesh by recombining the tetrahedra obtained from the constrained Delaunay triangulation of P. For step (1), we use a state-of-the-art algorithm to generate a smooth frame field. For step (2), we introduce an extension of Periodic Global Parameterization to the volumetric case. As compared with other global parameterization methods (such as CubeCover), our method relaxes some global constraints to avoid creating degenerate elements, at the expense of introducing some singularities that are meshed using non-hexahedral elements. For step (3), we build on the formalism introduced by Meshkat and Talmor, fill in a gap in their proof, and provide a complete enumeration of all the possible recombinations, as well as an algorithm that efficiently detects all the matches in a tetrahedral mesh. The method is evaluated and compared with the state of the art on a database of examples with various mesh complexities, varying from academic examples to real industrial cases. Compared with the method of Carrier-Baudoin et al., the method results in better scores for classical quality criteria of hexahedral-dominant meshes (hexahedral proportion, scaled Jacobian, etc.). The method also shows better robustness than CubeCover and its derivatives when applied to complicated industrial models."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17654","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: INRIA Nancy Grand-Est (Ray, Nicolas; Untereiner, Lionel; Lvy, Bruno); Universit&#233; de Lorraine (Sokolov, Dmitry)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17654","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17654","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17655","fieldValue":"Lai, Yu-Kun"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17655","fieldValue":"Chen, Shu-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17655","fieldValue":" Effectively characterizing the behavior of deformable objects has wide applicability but remains challenging. We present a new rotation-invariant deformation representation and a novel reconstruction algorithm to accurately reconstruct the positions and local rotations simultaneously. Meshes can be very efficiently reconstructed from our representation by matrix pre-decomposition, while, at the same time, hard or soft constraints can be flexibly specified with only positions of handles needed. Our approach is thus particularly suitable for constrained deformations guided by examples, providing significant benefits over state-of-the-art methods. Based on this, we further propose novel data-driven approaches to mesh deformation and non-rigid registration of deformable objects. Both problems are formulated consistently as finding an optimized model in the shape space that satisfies boundary constraints, either specified by the user, or according to the scan. By effectively exploiting the knowledge in the shape space, our method produces realistic deformation results in real-time and produces high quality registrations from a template model to a single noisy scan captured using a low-quality depth camera, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."}
