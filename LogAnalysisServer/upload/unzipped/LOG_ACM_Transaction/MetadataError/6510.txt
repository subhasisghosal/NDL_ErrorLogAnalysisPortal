The dangers of these sites have created a demand for safeguards that protect end-users from visiting them. This article explores how to detect malicious Web sites from the lexical and host-based features of their URLs. We show that this problem lends itself naturally to modern algorithms for online learning. Online algorithms not only process large numbers of URLs more efficiently than batch algorithms, they also adapt more quickly to new features in the continuously evolving distribution of malicious URLs. We develop a real-time system for gathering URL features and pair it with a real-time feed of labeled URLs from a large Web mail provider. From these features and labels, we are able to train an online classifier that detects malicious Web sites with 99&percnt; accuracy over a balanced dataset."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7353","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7353","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1669","fieldValue":" Misprediction is a major obstacle for increasing speculative out-of-order processors performance. Performance degradation depends on both the number of misprediction events and the recovery time associated with each one of them. In recent years a few checkpoint based microarchitectures have been proposed. In comparison with ROB-based processors, checkpoint processors are scalable and highly resource efficient. Unfortunately, in these proposals the misprediction recovery time is proportional to the instruction queue size. In this paper we analyze methods to reduce the misprediction recovery time. We propose a new register file management scheme and techniques to selectively flush the instruction queue and the load store queue, and to isolate deeply pipelined execution units. The result is a novel checkpoint processor with Constant misprediction RollBack time (CRB). We further present a streamlined, cost-efficient solution, which saves complexity at the price of slightly lower performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1669","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1669","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7354","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7354","fieldValue":"ACM"}
