Theoretical formulas describing the reliability function as well as Mean Time to Failure are derived. On the basis of our analysis, we show that p-cycles should not be used in wide-area networks since their reliability performance is outside the desired bounds."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9693","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9694","fieldValue":" SONET add\/drop multiplexers (ADMs) are dominant cost factors in WDM SONET rings. Whereas most previous papers on the topic concentrated on the number of wavelengths assigned to a given set of lightpaths, more recent papers argue that the number of ADMs is a more realistic cost measure. Some of these works discuss various heuristic algorithms for this problem, and the best known result is a 3\/2 approximation in Calinescu and Wan, 2002. Through the study of the relation between this problem and the problem of finding maximum disjoint rings in a given set of lightpaths we manage to shed more light onto this problem and to develop a 10\/7 + Îµ approximation for it."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9694","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9694","fieldValue":"ACM"}
