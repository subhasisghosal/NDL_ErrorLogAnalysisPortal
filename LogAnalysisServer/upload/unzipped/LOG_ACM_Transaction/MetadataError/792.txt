Compared to buffered routing, deflection routing provides area- and power-efficient communication and little loss of performance under low to medium traffic load. Under 3D environments, the deflection routing can yield even better performance than buffered routing when key aspects are properly taken into account. However, the existing deflection routing technique cannot be directly applied because the serialized TSV links will take longer time to send data than ordinary planar links and cause many problems. A naive deflection through a TSV link can cause significantly longer latency and more energy consumption even for communications through planar links. This article proposes a method to mitigate the effect and also solve arising deadlock and livelock problems. Evaluation of the proposed scheme shows its effectiveness in throughput, latency, and energy consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13345","fieldValue":" Many combinatorial optimization problems in the embedded systems and design automation domains involve decision making in multidimensional spaces. The multidimensional multiple-choice knapsack problem (MMKP) is among the most challenging of the encountered optimization problems. MMKP problem instances appear for example in chip multiprocessor runtime resource management and in global routing of wiring in circuits. Chip multiprocessor resource management requires solving MMKP under real-time constraints, whereas global routing requires scalability of the solution approach to extremely large MMKP instances. This article presents a novel MMKP heuristic, CPH (for Compositional Pareto-algebraic Heuristic), which is a parameterized compositional heuristic based on the principles of Pareto algebra. Compositionality allows incremental computation of solutions. The parameterization allows tuning of the heuristic to the problem at hand. These aspects make CPH a very versatile heuristic. When tuning CPH for computation time, MMKP instances can be solved in real time with better results than the fastest MMKP heuristic so far. When tuning CPH for solution quality, it finds several new solutions for standard benchmarks that are not found by any existing heuristic. CPH furthermore scales to extremely large problem instances. We illustrate and evaluate the use of CPH in both chip multiprocessor resource management and in global routing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13345","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13345","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13346","fieldValue":" Integrating coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs) into a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) presents many benefits as well as important challenges. One of the challenges is how to customize the architecture for the target applications efficiently and effectively without performing explicit design space exploration. In this article we present a novel methodology for incremental interconnect customization of CGRAs that can suggest a new interconnection architecture which is able to maximize the performance for a given set of application kernels while minimizing the hardware cost. In our methodology, we translate the problem of interconnect customization into that of inexact graph matching, and we devised a heuristic for A&ast; search algorithm to efficiently solve the inexact graph matching problem. Our experimental results demonstrate that our customization method can quickly find application-optimized interconnections that exhibit 80&percnt; higher performance on average compared to the base architecture which has mesh interconnections, with little energy and hardware increase in interconnections and muxes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13346","fieldValue":"ACM"}
