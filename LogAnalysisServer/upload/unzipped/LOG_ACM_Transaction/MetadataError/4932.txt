This article presents an audiovisual approach for automatic assessment of this relevant musical study practice. The proposed system combines the gesture of meter-mimicking (video information) with the melodic transcription (audio information), where hand movement works as a metronome, controlling the time flow (tempo) of the musical piece. Thus, meter-mimicking is used to align the music score (ground truth) with the sung melody, allowing assessment even in time-dynamic scenarios. Audio analysis is applied to achieve the melodic transcription of the sung notes and the solfège performances are evaluated by a set of Bayesian classifiers that were generated from real evaluations done by experts listeners."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/25792","fieldValue":"Solf&egrave;ge"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/1263","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2451248.2451249\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1263","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1263","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1263","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3489","fieldValue":"Hibbard, Paul B"}
