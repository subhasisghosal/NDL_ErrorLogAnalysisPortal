Thirty adults with moderate Alzheimerâ\u20AC™s disease participated in two personally relevant conversations with an AAC device. For twelve of the participants the AAC device included voice output. The AAC device was the $Flexiboard^TM$ containing sixteen messages needed to discuss a favorite autobiographical topic chosen by the participant and his\/her family caregivers. Ten-minute conversations were videotaped in participantsâ\u20AC™ residences and analyzed for four conversational measures related to the participantsâ\u20AC™ communicative behavior. Results show that AAC devices with digitized voice output depress conversational performance and distract participants with moderate Alzheimerâ\u20AC™s disease as compared to similar devices without voice output. There were significantly more 1-word utterances and fewer total utterances when AAC devices included voice output, and the rate of topic elaborations\/initiations was significantly lower when voice output was present. Discussion about the novelty of voice output for this population of elders and the need to train elders to use this technology is provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/1418","fieldValue":"Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1418","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1418","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4899","fieldValue":" Gene expression data clustering is one of the important tasks of functional genomics as it provides a powerful tool for studying functional relationships of genes in a biological process. Identifying coexpressed groups of genes represents the basic challenge in gene clustering problem. In this regard, a gene clustering algorithm, termed as robust rough-fuzzy $(c)$-means, is proposed judiciously integrating the merits of rough sets and fuzzy sets. While the concept of lower and upper approximations of rough sets deals with uncertainty, vagueness, and incompleteness in cluster definition, the integration of probabilistic and possibilistic memberships of fuzzy sets enables efficient handling of overlapping partitions in noisy environment. The concept of possibilistic lower bound and probabilistic boundary of a cluster, introduced in robust rough-fuzzy $(c)$-means, enables efficient selection of gene clusters. An efficient method is proposed to select initial prototypes of different gene clusters, which enables the proposed $(c)$-means algorithm to converge to an optimum or near optimum solutions and helps to discover coexpressed gene clusters. The effectiveness of the algorithm, along with a comparison with other algorithms, is demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively on 14 yeast microarray data sets."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4899","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4899","fieldValue":"Clustering algorithms,Approximation methods,Gene expression,Probabilistic logic,Prototypes,Robustness,Indexes,rough sets,Clustering algorithms,Approximation methods,Gene expression,Probabilistic logic,Prototypes,Robustness,Indexes,fuzzy sets,Microarray,gene clustering,overlapping clustering"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4899","fieldValue":"ACM"}
