{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23996","fieldValue":" The World Wide Web provides an abundant source of medical information. This information can assist people who are not healthcare professionals to better understand health and illness, and to provide them with feasible explanations for symptoms. However, the Web has the potential to increase the anxieties of people who have little or no medical training, especially when Web search is employed as a diagnostic procedure. We use the term cyberchondria to refer to the unfounded escalation of concerns about common symptomatology, based on the review of search results and literature on the Web. We performed a large-scale, longitudinal, log-based study of how people search for medical information online, supported by a survey of 515 individuals' health-related search experiences. We focused on the extent to which common, likely innocuous symptoms can escalate into the review of content on serious, rare conditions that are linked to the common symptoms. Our results show that Web search engines have the potential to escalate medical concerns. We show that escalation is associated with the amount and distribution of medical content viewed by users, the presence of escalatory terminology in pages visited, and a user's predisposition to escalate versus to seek more reasonable explanations for ailments. We also demonstrate the persistence of postsession anxiety following escalations and the effect that such anxieties can have on interrupting user's activities across multiple sessions. Our findings underscore the potential costs and challenges of cyberchondria and suggest actionable design implications that hold opportunity for improving the search and navigation experience for people turning to the Web to interpret common symptoms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23996","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23996","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23997","fieldValue":"Sarn, Giuseppe M L"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23997","fieldValue":" Web recommender systems are Web applications capable of generating useful suggestions for visitors of Internet sites. However, in the case of large user communities and in presence of a high number of Web sites, these tasks are computationally onerous, even more if the client software runs on devices with limited resources. Moreover, the quality of the recommendations strictly depends on how the recommendation algorithm takes into account the currently used device. Some approaches proposed in the literature provide multidimensional recommendations considering, besides items and users, also the exploited device. However, these systems do not efficiently perform, since they assign to either the client or the server the arduous cost of computing recommendations. In this article, we argue that a fully distributed organization is a suitable solution to improve the efficiency of multidimensional recommender systems. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel distributed architecture, called MUADDIB, where each user's device is provided with a device assistant that autonomously retrieves information about the user's behavior. Moreover, a single profiler, associated with the user, periodically collects information coming from the different user's device assistants to construct a global user's profile. In order to generate recommendations, a recommender precomputes data provided by the profilers. This way, the site manager has only the task of suitably presenting the content of the site, while the computation of the recommendations is assigned to the other distributed components. Some experiments conducted on real data and using some well-known metrics show that the system works more effectively and efficiently than other device-based distributed recommenders."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23997","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23997","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23998","fieldValue":" Information retrieval (IR) systems typically compress their indexes in order to increase their efficiency. Static pruning is a form of lossy data compression: it removes from the index, data that is estimated to be the least important to retrieval performance, according to some criterion. Generally, pruning criteria are derived from term weighting functions, which assign weights to terms according to their contribution to a document's contents. Usually, document-term occurrences that are assigned a low weight are ruled out from the index. The main assumption is that those entries contribute little to the document content. We present a novel pruning technique that is based on a probabilistic model of IR. We employ the Probability Ranking Principle as a decision criterion over which posting list entries are to be pruned. The proposed approach requires the estimation of three probabilities, combining them in such a way that we gather all the necessary information to apply the aforementioned criterion. We evaluate our proposed pruning technique on five TREC collections and various retrieval tasks, and show that in almost every situation it outperforms the state of the art in index pruning. The main contribution of this work is proposing a pruning technique that stems directly from the same source as probabilistic retrieval models, and hence is independent of the final model used for retrieval."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23998","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23998","fieldValue":"ACM"}
