A virtual topology is a collection of optical lightpaths embedded in a physical topology. A packet sent from the source node travels over one or more lightpaths en route to its destination. Within a lightpath, transmission is entirely optical. At the terminus of a lightpath the data is converted into the electronic domain where it may be retransmitted on another lightpath toward its destination. Since the conversion of the packet from the optical to the electronic domain introduces delays and uses limited physical resources, one important objective is to find virtual topologies which minimize either the maximum or average number of lightpaths used from the source to all destination nodes. Although this problem is NP-complete in general, we show that minimizing the maximum or average number of lightpaths in path and ring topologies can be solved optimally by efficient algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9306","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9307","fieldValue":" We present an analytical technique of very low complexity, using the inclusion-exclusion principle of combinatorics, for the performance evaluation of all-optical, wavelength-division multiplexed networks with no wavelength conversion. The technique is a generalized reduced-load approximation scheme which is applicable to arbitrary topologies and traffic patterns. One of the main issues in computing blocking probabilities in all-optical networks is the significant link load correlation introduced by the wavelength continuity constraint. One of the models we propose takes this into account and gives good results even under conditions with high link load correlation. Through numerous experiments we show that our models can be used to obtain fast and accurate estimates of blocking probabilities in all-optical networks and scale well with the path length and capacity of the network. We also extend one of our models to take into account alternate routing, ina the form of Fixed Alternate Routing and Least Loaded Routing."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9307","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8360","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
