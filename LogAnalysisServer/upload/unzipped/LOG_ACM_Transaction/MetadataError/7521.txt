Concepts such as coordinate space embedding help reduce the number and dynamism complexity of bindings and state needed for this indirection. Routing protocols which do not use such concepts often tend to flood packets during route discovery or dissemination, and hence have limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce Orthogonal Rendezvous Routing Protocol (ORRP) for meshed wireless networks. ORRP is a lightweight-but-scalable routing protocol utilizing directional communications (such as directional antennas or free-space-optical transceivers) to relax information requirements such as coordinate space embedding and node localization. The ORRP source and ORRP destination send route discovery and route dissemination packets respectively in locally-chosen orthogonal directions. Connectivity happens when these paths intersect (i.e., rendezvous). We show that ORRP achieves connectivity with high probability even in sparse networks with voids. ORRP scales well without imposing DHT-like graph structures (eg: trees, rings, torus etc). The total state information required is $O(N^3\/2$ for N-node networks, and the state is uniformly distributed. ORRP does not resort to flooding either in route discovery or dissemination. The price paid by ORRP is suboptimality in terms of path stretch compared to the shortest path; however we characterize the average penalty and find that it is not severe."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9851","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9852","fieldValue":" A Pareto-efficient, goal-driven, and distributed power control scheme for wireless networks is presented. We use a non-cooperative game-theoretic approach to propose a novel pricing scheme that is linearly proportional to the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and analytically show that with a proper choice of prices (proportionality constants), the outcome of the noncooperative power control game is a unique and Pareto-efficient Nash equilibrium (NE). This can be utilized for constrained-power control to satisfy specific goals (such as fairness, aggregate throughput optimization, or trading off between these two goals). For each one of the above goals, the dynamic price for each user is also analytically obtained. In a centralized (base station) price setting, users should inform the base station of their path gains and their maximum transmit-powers. In a distributed price setting, for each goal, an algorithm for users to update their transmit-powers is also presented that converges to a unique fixed-point in which the corresponding goal is satisfied. Simulation results confirm our analytical developments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9852","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9852","fieldValue":"Pareto-efficient and goal-driven power control in wireless networks: a game-theoretic approach with a novel pricing scheme"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9852","fieldValue":"ACM"}
