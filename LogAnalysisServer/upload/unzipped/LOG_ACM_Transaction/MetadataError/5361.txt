{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1347","fieldValue":" Self-organized systems typically consist of distributed autonomous entities. An increasing part of such systems is characterized by openness and heterogeneity of participants. For instance, open desktop computing grids provide a framework for unrestrictedly joining in. However, openness and heterogeneity present severe challenges to the overall systemâ\u20AC™s stability and efficiency since uncooperative and even malicious participants are free to join. A promising solution for this problem is to introduce technical trust as a basis; however, in turn, the utilization of trust opens space for negative emergent behavior. This article introduces a system-wide observation and control loop that influences the self-organized behavior to provide a performant and robust platform for benevolent participants. Thereby, the observation part is responsible for gathering information and deriving a system description. We introduce a graph-based approach to identify groups of suspicious or malicious agents and demonstrate that this clustering process is highly successful for the considered stereotype agent behaviors. In addition, the controller part guides the system behavior by issuing norms that make use of incentives and sanctions. We further present a concept for closing the control loop and show experimental results that highlight the potential benefit of establishing such a control loop."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4504","fieldValue":" Currently, relation extraction (RE) and event extraction (EE) are the two main streams of biological information extraction. In 2009, the majority of these RE and EE research efforts were centered around the BioCreative II.5 Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) challenge and the â\u20ACœBioNLP event extraction shared task.â\u20AC? Although these challenges took somewhat different approaches, they share the same ultimate goal of extracting bio-knowledge from the literature. This paper compares the two challenge task definitions, and presents a unified system that was successfully applied in both these and several other PPI extraction task settings. The AkaneRE system has three parts: A core engine for RE, a pool of modules for specific solutions, and a configuration language to adapt the system to different tasks. The core engine is based on machine learning, using either Support Vector Machines or Statistical Classifiers and features extracted from given training data. The specific modules solve tasks like sentence boundary detection, tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, named entity recognition, generation of potential relations, generation of machine learning features for each relation, and finally, assignment of confidence scores and ranking of candidate relations. With these components, the AkaneRE system produces state-of-the-art results, and the system is freely available for academic purposes at http:\/\/www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp\/satre\/akane\/."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4504","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4504","fieldValue":"Text mining, machine learning, language parsing and understanding, bioinformatics (genome or protein) databases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4504","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4504","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4505","fieldValue":"Cao, Yong-gang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4505","fieldValue":" The team at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee developed an information retrieval and machine learning framework. Our framework requires only the standardized training data and depends upon minimal external knowledge resources and minimal parsing. Within the framework, we built our text mining systems and participated for the first time in all three BioCreative II.5 Challenge tasks. The results show that our systems performed among the top five teams for raw F1 scores in all three tasks and came in third place for the homonym ortholog F1 scores for the INT task. The results demonstrated that our IR-based framework is efficient, robust, and potentially scalable."}
