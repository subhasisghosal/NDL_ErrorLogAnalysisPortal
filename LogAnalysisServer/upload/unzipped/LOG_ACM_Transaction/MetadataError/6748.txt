We propose two main approaches, namely the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework and the recursive regularization scheme. The key idea in both approaches is to reinforce the similarity among parameter across the nodes in a hierarchy or network based on the proximity and connectivity of the nodes. For scalability, we develop hierarchical variational inference algorithms and fast dual coordinate descent training procedures with parallelization. In our experiments for classification problems with hundreds of thousands of classes and millions of training instances with terabytes of parameters, the proposed methods show consistent and statistically significant improvements over other competing approaches, and the best results on multiple benchmark datasets for large-scale classification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8003","fieldValue":" This article proposes LA-LDA, a location-aware probabilistic generative model that exploits location-based ratings to model user profiles and produce recommendations. Most of the existing recommendation models do not consider the spatial information of users or items; however, LA-LDA supports three classes of location-based ratings, namely spatial user ratings for nonspatial items, nonspatial user ratings for spatial items, and spatial user ratings for spatial items. LA-LDA consists of two components, ULA-LDA and ILA-LDA, which are designed to take into account user and item location information, respectively. The component ULA-LDA explicitly incorporates and quantifies the influence from local public preferences to produce recommendations by considering user home locations, whereas the component ILA-LDA recommends items that are closer in both taste and travel distance to the querying users by capturing item co-occurrence patterns, as well as item location co-occurrence patterns. The two components of LA-LDA can be applied either separately or collectively, depending on the available types of location-based ratings. To demonstrate the applicability and flexibility of the LA-LDA model, we deploy it to both top-k recommendation and cold start recommendation scenarios. Experimental evidence on large-scale real-world data, including the data from Gowalla (a location-based social network), DoubanEvent (an event-based social network), and MovieLens (a movie recommendation system), reveal that LA-LDA models user profiles more accurately by outperforming existing recommendation models for top-k recommendation and the cold start problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8004","fieldValue":"Zhan, De-Chuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8004","fieldValue":"Zhou, Zhi-Hua"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8004","fieldValue":" In real tasks, usually a good classification performance can only be obtained when a good distance metric is obtained; therefore, distance metric learning has attracted significant attention in the past few years. Typical studies of distance metric learning evaluate how to construct an appropriate distance metric that is able to separate training data points from different classes or satisfy a set of constraints (e.g., must-links and\/or cannot-links). It is noteworthy that this task becomes challenging when there are only limited labeled training data points and no constraints are given explicitly. Moreover, most existing approaches aim to construct a global distance metric that is applicable to all data points. However, different data points may have different properties and may require different distance metrics. We notice that data points in real tasks are often connected by physical links (e.g., people are linked with each other in social networks; personal webpages are often connected to other webpages, including nonpersonal webpages), but the linkage information has not been exploited in distance metric learning. In this article, we develop a pairwised specific distance (PSD) approach that exploits the structures of physical linkages and in particular captures the key observations that nonmetric and clique linkages imply the appearance of different or unique semantics, respectively. It is noteworthy that, rather than generating a global distance, PSD generates different distances for different pairs of data points; this property is desired in applications involving complicated data semantics. We mainly present PSD for multi-class learning and further extend it to multi-label learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of PSD, especially in the scenarios in which there are very limited labeled training data points and no explicit constraints are given."}
