We base our proposal on a formal study of a CDN system, carried out through the exploitation of a fluid flow model characterization of the network of servers. Starting from such characterization, we derive and prove a lemma about the network queues equilibrium. This result is then leveraged in order to devise a novel distributed and time-continuous algorithm for load balancing, which is also reformulated in a time-discrete version. The discrete formulation of the proposed balancing law is eventually discussed in terms of its actual implementation in a real-world scenario. Finally, the overall approach is validated by means of simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10407","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10408","fieldValue":" Neighbor discovery is an important first step in the initialization of a wireless ad hoc network. In this paper, we design and analyze several algorithms for neighbor discovery in wireless networks. Starting with a single-hop wireless network of n nodes, we propose a Î˜(n ln n) ALOHA-like neighbor discovery algorithm when nodes cannot detect collisions, and an order-optimal Î˜(n) receiver feedback-based algorithm when nodes can detect collisions. Our algorithms neither require nodes to have a priori estimates of the number of neighbors nor synchronization between nodes. Our algorithms allow nodes to begin execution at different time instants and to terminate neighbor discovery upon discovering all their neighbors. We finally show that receiver feedback can be used to achieve a Î˜(n) running time, even when nodes cannot detect collisions. We then analyze neighbor discovery in a general multihop setting. We establish an upper bound of O(Î\u201D ln n) on the running time of the ALOHA-like algorithm, where Î\u201D denotes the maximum node degree in the network and n the total number of nodes. We also establish a lower bound of Î©(Î\u201D + ln n) on the running time of any randomized neighbor discovery algorithm. Our result thus implies that the ALOHA-like algorithm is at most a factor min (Î\u201D, ln n) worse than optimal."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10408","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10409","fieldValue":" We propose a new framework for wireless network virtualization. In this framework, service providers (SPs) and the network operator (NO) are decoupled from each other: The NO is solely responsible for spectrum management, and SPs are responsible for quality-of-service (QoS) management for their own users. SPs compete for the shared wireless resources to satisfy their distinct service objectives and constraints. We model the dynamic interactions among SPs and the NO as a stochastic game. SPs bid for the resources via dynamically announcing their value functions. The game is regulated by the NO through: 1) sum-utility optimization under rate region constraints; 2) enforcement of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism for pricing the instantaneous rate consumption; and 3) declaration of conjectured prices for future resource consumption. We prove that there exists one Nash equilibrium in the conjectural prices that is efficient, i.e., the sum-utility is maximized. Thus, the NO has the incentive to compute the equilibrium point and feedback to SPs. Given the conjectural prices and the VCG mechanism, we also show that SPs must reveal their truthful value functions at each step to maximize their long-term utilities. As another major contribution, we develop an online learning algorithm that allows the SPs to update the value functions and the NO to update the conjectural prices iteratively. Thus, the proposed framework can deal with unknown dynamics in traffic characteristics and channel conditions. We present simulation results to show the convergence to the Nash equilibrium prices under various dynamic traffic and channel conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10409","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
