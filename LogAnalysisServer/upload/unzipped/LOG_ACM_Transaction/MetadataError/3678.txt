The implementation technique highlights the combination of hard configuration constraints using weights (control part)â\u20AC\u201Densured statically and fulfilled by the system at runtimeâ\u20AC\u201Dand soft constraints (decision part) that, given a set of correct and accessible configurations, choose one of them. An application model of an image processing application is presented, then transformed and synthesized to be executed on a Xilinx platform to show how the controller, executed on a Microblaze, manages the hardware reconfigurations."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21870","fieldValue":"BZR"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21870","fieldValue":"UML\/MARTE"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21870","fieldValue":"Extending UML\/MARTE to Support Discrete Controller Synthesis, Application to Reconfigurable Systems-on-Chip Modeling"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21870","fieldValue":"ACM"}
