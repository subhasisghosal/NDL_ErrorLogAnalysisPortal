Soft errors (or transient faults) are becoming a serious design concern in embedded systems including CGRAs since the soft error rate is increasing exponentially as technology is scaling. A recently proposed software-based technique with TMR (Triple Modular Redundancy) implemented on CGRAs incurs extreme overheads in terms of runtime and energy consumption mainly due to expensive voting mechanisms for the outputs from the triplication of every operation. In this article, we propose selective validation mechanisms for efficient modular redundancy techniques in the datapaths on CGRAs. Our techniques selectively validate the results at synchronous operations rather than every operation in order to reduce the expensive performance overhead from the validation mechanism. We also present an optimization technique to further improve the runtime and the energy consumption by minimizing synchronous operations where a validating mechanism needs to be applied. Our experimental results demonstrate that our selective validation-based TMR technique with our optimization on CGRAs can improve the runtime by 41.0&percnt; and the energy consumption by 26.2&percnt; on average over benchmarks as compared to the recently proposed software-based TMR technique with the full validation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6987","fieldValue":"CGRA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6987","fieldValue":"DMR"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6987","fieldValue":"TMR"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6987","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6987","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6988","fieldValue":" This article focuses on the design of safe and attack-resilient Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) equipped with multiple sensors measuring the same physical variable. A malicious attacker may be able to disrupt system performance through compromising a subset of these sensors. Consequently, we develop a precise and resilient sensor fusion algorithm that combines the data received from all sensors by taking into account their specified precisions. In particular, we note that in the presence of a shared bus, in which messages are broadcast to all nodes in the network, the attackerâ\u20AC™s impact depends on what sensors he has seen before sending the corrupted measurements. Therefore, we explore the effects of communication schedules on the performance of sensor fusion and provide theoretical and experimental results advocating for the use of the Ascending schedule, which orders sensor transmissions according to their precision starting from the most precise. In addition, to improve the accuracy of the sensor fusion algorithm, we consider the dynamics of the system in order to incorporate past measurements at the current time. Possible ways of mapping sensor measurement history are investigated in the article and are compared in terms of the confidence in the final output of the sensor fusion. We show that the precision of the algorithm using history is never worse than the no-history one, while the benefits may be significant. Furthermore, we utilize the complementary properties of the two methods and show that their combination results in a more precise and resilient algorithm. Finally, we validate our approach in simulation and experiments on a real unmanned ground robot."}
