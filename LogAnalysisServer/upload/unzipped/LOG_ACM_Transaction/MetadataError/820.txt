This article addresses compiler optimization for reducing the power consumption of multithread programs. A traditional compiler employs energy management techniques that analyze component usage in control-flow graphs with a focus on single-thread programs. In this environment the leakage power can be controlled by inserting on and off instructions based on component usage information generated by flow equations. However, these methods cannot be directly extended to a multithread environment due to concurrent execution issues. This article presents a multithread power-gating framework composed of multithread power-gating analysis (MTPGA) and predicated power-gating (PPG) energy management mechanisms for reducing the leakage power when executing multithread programs on simultaneous multithreading (SMT) machines. Our multithread programming model is based on hierarchical bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) models. Based on a multithread component analysis with dataflow equations, our MTPGA framework estimates the energy usage of multithread programs and inserts PPG operations as power controls for energy management. We performed experiments by incorporating our power optimization framework into SUIF compiler tools and by simulating the energy consumption with a post-estimated SMT simulator based on Wattch toolkits. The experimental results show that the total energy consumption of a system with PPG support and our power optimization method is reduced by an average of 10.09&percnt; for BSP programs relative to a system without a power-gating mechanism on leakage contribution set to 30&percnt;; and the total energy consumption is reduced by an average of 4.27&percnt; on leakage contribution set to 10&percnt;. The results demonstrate our mechanisms are effective in reducing the leakage energy of BSP multithread programs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13407","fieldValue":" Geometry scaling of semiconductor devices enables the design of ultra-low-cost (e.g., below 1 USD) battery-powered resource-constrained ubiquitous devices for environment, urban life, and body monitoring. These sensor-based devices require high performance to react in front of infrequent particular events as well as extreme energy efficiency in order to extend battery lifetime during most of the time when low performance is required. In addition, they require real-time guarantees. The most suitable technological solution for these devices consists of using hybrid processors able to operate at: (i) high voltage to provide high performance and (ii) near-\/subthreshold voltage to provide ultra-low energy consumption. However, the most efficient SRAM memories for each voltage level differ and trading off different SRAM designs is mandatory. This is particularly true for cache memories, which occupy most of the processor's area. In this article, we propose new, simple, single-Vcc-domain hybrid L1 cache architectures suitable for reliable hybrid high and ultra-low voltage operation. In particular, the cache is designed by combining heterogeneous SRAM cell types: some of the cache ways are optimized to satisfy high-performance requirements during high voltage operation, whereas the rest of the ways provide ultra-low energy consumption and reliability during near-\/subthreshold voltage operation. We analyze the performance, energy, and power impact of the proposed cache designs when using them to implement L1 caches in a processor. Experimental results show that our hybrid caches can efficiently and reliably operate across a wide range of voltages, consuming little energy at near-\/subthreshold voltage as well as providing high performance at high voltage without decreasing reliability levels to provide strong performance guarantees, as required for our target market."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13407","fieldValue":"ACM"}
