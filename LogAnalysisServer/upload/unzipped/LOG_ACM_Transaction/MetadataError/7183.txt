Almost all proposed VBR traffic models are DRMs. DRMs generate only data arrival rate, and are good for estimating average packet-loss and ATM buffer overflowing probabilities, but fail to identify such details as percentage of frames affected. FSMs generate sizes of individual MPEG frames, and are good for studying frame loss rate in addition to data loss rate. Among three previously proposed FSMs: 1) one generates frame sizes for full-length movies without preserving group-of-pictures (GOP) periodicity; 2) one generates VBR video traffic for news videos from scene content description provided to it; and 3) one generates frame sizes for full-length movies without preserving size-based video-segment transitions. In this paper, we propose two FSMs that generate frame sizes for full-length VBR videos preserving both GOP periodicity and size-based video-segment transitions.First, two-pass algorithms for analysis of full-length VBR videos are presented. After two-pass analysis, these algorithms identify size-based classes of video shots into which the GOPs are partitioned. Frames in each class produce three data sets, one each for I-, B-, and P-type frames. Each of these data sets is modeled with an axis-shifted Gamma distribution. Markov renewal processes model (size-based) video segment transitions. We have used QQ plots to show visual similarity of model-generated VBR video data sets with original data set. Leaky-bucket simulation study has been used to show similarity of data and frame loss rates between model-generated VBR videos and original video. Our study of frame-based VBR video revealed that even a low data-loss rate could affect a large fraction of I frames, causing a significant degradation of the quality of transmitted video."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9187","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9187","fieldValue":"MPEG"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1827","fieldValue":" Data mining is a new field of computer science with a wide range of applications. Its goal is to extract knowledge from massive datasets in a human-understandable structure, for example, the decision trees. In this article we present an innovative, high-performance, system-level architecture for the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) algorithm, one of the most important and widely used algorithms in the data mining area. Our proposed architecture exploits parallelism at the decision variable level, and was fully implemented and evaluated on a modern high-performance reconfigurable platform, the Convey HC-1 server, that features four FPGAs and a multicore processor. Our FPGA-based implementation was integrated with the widely used â\u20ACœrpartâ\u20AC? software library of the R project in order to provide the first fully functional reconfigurable system that can handle real-world large databases. The proposed system, named HC-CART system, achieves a performance speedup of up to two orders of magnitude compared to well-known single-threaded data mining software platforms, such as WEKA and the R platform. It also outperforms similar hardware systems which implement parts of the complete application by an order of magnitude. Finally, we show that the HC-CART system offers higher performance speedup than some other proposed parallel software implementations of decision tree construction algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1827","fieldValue":"HC-CART: A parallel system implementation of data mining classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm on a multi-FPGA system"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1827","fieldValue":"ACM"}
