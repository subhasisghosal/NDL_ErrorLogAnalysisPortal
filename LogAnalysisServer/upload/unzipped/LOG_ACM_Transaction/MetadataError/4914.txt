Cooperation strategies have been considered as a solution to address these network limitations. In the presence of unstable network infrastructures, mobile nodes cooperate with each other, forwarding data and performing other specific network functionalities. This article proposes a generalized incentive-based cooperation solution for mobile services and applications called MobiCoop. This reputation-based scheme includes an application framework for mobile applications that uses a Web service to handle all the nodes reputation and network permissions. The main goal of MobiCoop is to provide Internet services to mobile devices without network connectivity through cooperation with neighbor devices. The article includes a performance evaluation study of MobiCoop considering both a real scenario (using a prototype) and a simulation-based study. Results show that the proposed approach provides network connectivity independency to users with mobile apps when Internet connectivity is unavailable. Then, it is concluded that MobiCoop improved significantly the overall system performance and the service provided for a given mobile application."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25749","fieldValue":" The traditional k-out-of-n Visual Cryptography (VC) scheme is the conception of â\u20ACœall or nothingâ\u20AC? for n participants to share a secret image. The original secret image can be visually revealed only when a subset of k or more shares are superimposed together, but if the number of stacked shares are less than k, nothing will be revealed. On the other hand, a Progressive Visual Cryptography (PVC) scheme differs from the traditional VC with respect to decoding. In PVC, clarity and contrast of the decoded secret image will be increased progressively with the number of stacked shares. Much of the existing state-of-the-art research on PVC has problems with pixel expansion and random pattern of the shares. In this article, a novel scheme of progressive visual cryptography with four or more number of unexpanded as well as meaningful shares has been proposed. For this, a novel and efficient Candidate Block Replacement preprocessing approach and a basis matrix creation algorithm have also been introduced. The proposed method also eliminates many unnecessary encryption constraints like a predefined codebook for encoding and decoding the secret image, restriction on the number of participants, and so on. From the experiments, it is observed that the reconstruction probability of black pixels in the decoded image corresponding to the black pixel in the secret image is always 1, whereas that of white pixels is 0.5 irrespective of the meaningful contents visible in the shares, thus ensuring the value of contrast to alwasys be 50&percnt;. Therefore, a reconstructed image can be easily identified by a human visual system without any computation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25749","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25749","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25750","fieldValue":"Muntean, Gabriel-Miro"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25750","fieldValue":" Media-rich content plays a vital role in consumer applications today, as these applications try to find new and interesting ways to engage their users. Video, audio, and the more traditional forms of media content continue to dominate with respect to the use of media content to enhance the user experience. Tactile interactivity has also now become widely popular in modern computing applications, while our olfactory and gustatory senses continue to have a limited role. However, in recent times, there have been significant advancements regarding the use of olfactory media content (i.e., smell), and there are a variety of devices now available to enable its computer-controlled emission. This paper explores the impact of the audio stream on user perception of olfactory-enhanced video content in the presence of skews between the olfactory and video media. This research uses the results from two experimental studies of user-perceived quality of olfactory-enhanced multimedia, where audio was present and absent, respectively. Specifically, the paper shows that the user Quality of Experience (QoE) is generally higher in the absence of audio for nearly perfect synchronized olfactory-enhanced multimedia presentations (i.e., an olfactory media skew of between {âˆ\u201910,+10s}); however, for greater olfactory media skews (ranging between {âˆ\u201930s;âˆ\u201910s} and {+10s, +30s}) user QoE is higher when the audio stream is present. It can be concluded that the presence of the audio has the ability to mask larger synchronization skews between the other media components in olfaction-enhanced multimedia presentations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25750","fieldValue":"ACM"}
