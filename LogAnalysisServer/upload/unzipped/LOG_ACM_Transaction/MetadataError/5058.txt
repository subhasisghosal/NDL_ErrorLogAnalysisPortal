WASNs are characterized by low computational resources in each node and by limited connectivity between the nodes. Novel bi-directional tree-based distributed estimation--maximization (DEM) algorithms are proposed to circumvent these inherent limitations. We show that the proposed algorithms are capable of localizing static acoustic sources in reverberant enclosures without a priori information on the number of sources. Unlike serial estimation procedures (like ring-based algorithms), the new algorithms enable simultaneous computations in the nodes and exhibit greater robustness to communication failures. Specifically, the recursive distributed EM (RDEM) variant is better suited to online applications due to its recursive nature. Furthermore, the RDEM outperforms the other proposed variants in terms of convergence speed and simplicity. Performance is demonstrated by an extensive experimental study consisting of both simulated and actual environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3810","fieldValue":"Durn-Daz, Ivn"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3810","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose a method for solving the permutation problem that is inherent in the separation of convolved mixtures of speech signals in the time-frequency domain. The proposed method obtains the solution through maximization of a contrast function that exploits the similarity of the temporal envelope of the speech spectrum. For this purpose, the contrast calculation uses a global measure of similarity based on the recently developed family of generalized Alpha-Beta divergences, which depend on two tuning parameters, alpha and beta. This parameterization is exploited to best measure the similarity of the speech spectrum and to obtain solutions that are robust against noise and outliers. The ability of this contrast function to solve the permutation problem is supported by a theoretical study that shows that for a simple time-frequency speech model, the contrast value reaches its maximum when the estimated components are properly aligned. Several performance studies demonstrate that the proposed method maintains a high level of permutation correction accuracy in a wide variety of acoustic environments. Moreover, it produces better results than other state-of-the-art methods for solving permutations in highly reverberant environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3810","fieldValue":"A contrast function based on generalized divergences for solving the permutation problem in convolved speech mixtures"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3810","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3810","fieldValue":"ACM"}
