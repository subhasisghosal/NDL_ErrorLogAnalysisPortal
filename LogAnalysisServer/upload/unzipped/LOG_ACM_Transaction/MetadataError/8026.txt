Long gone are the days of entering data manually into a spreadsheet on a local workstation. The world's most powerful and ground-breaking experiments generate exabytes of information, which must be distributed to multiple labs for analysis and interpretation. Such trends reveal the unwavering importance of new communication paradigms, like multicasting and manycasting, which provide point-to-multipoint data transfers. Typically, these all-important mechanisms are provided at the optical layer, where split-capable cross-connects split input signals into multiple output signals all-optically. Unfortunately, some of the world's largest and most powerful networks do not have the hardware infrastructure to support such functionality, but allow for point-to-point communication exclusively. In such split-incapable (SI) networks, multicast and manycast must be provided as a logical overlay to the pre-existing and limited unicast infrastructure. In this paper, we present two overlay models for providing manycast support in SI networks: Manycasting with Drop at Member Node (MA-DMN) and Manycasting with Drop at Any Node (MA-DAN). Through the development of integer linear programs (ILPs) and heuristics, we evaluate these models in terms of both optimal solutions and efficient approximations for both small-scale and large-scale networks and consider both static and dynamic traffic scenarios. Our results demonstrate that despite a small tradeoff in additional complexity and delay from signal conversion to the optical domain, our models provide efficient utilization of network resources and greatly surpass the standard naive approach of establishing paths to every destination."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10872","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10872","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10872","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10873","fieldValue":" Proportional Fair (PF) scheduling algorithms are the de facto standard in cellular networks. They exploit the users' channel state diversity (induced by fast-fading) and are optimal for stationary channel state distributions and an infinite time-horizon. However, mobile users experience a nonstationary channel, due to slow-fading (on the order of seconds), and are associated with base stations for short periods. Hence, we develop the Predictive Finite-horizon PF Scheduling $((PF)^2S) Framework that exploits mobility. We present extensive channel measurement results from a 3G network and characterize mobility-induced channel state trends. We show that a user's channel state is highly reproducible and leverage that to develop a data rate prediction mechanism. We then present a few channel allocation estimation algorithms that exploit the prediction mechanism. Our trace-based simulations consider instances of the ((PF)2$S) Framework composed of combinations of prediction and channel allocation estimation algorithms. They indicate that the framework can increase the throughput by 15%-55% compared to traditional PF schedulers, while improving fairness."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10873","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
