We discuss the needs for such services, our early research efforts in this direction which lead to prototyping certain benchmark services, and the current state of work in this area. We demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture by focusing on services which involve wireline PSTN as well as the wireless aspects (2 G, 2.5 G) of the PSTN. Our methodology is attractive since it keeps each of the domains (PSTN and Internet) unaware as to where the service is executing with respect to which domain actually requested the service. Individual entities participating in the service do not have any knowledge that external entities from another domain also contributed in the execution and fulfillment of such services. Our approach, as embodied in the service architecture, is to leverage the best of the Internet protocols (SIP, XML, HTTP) and technologies (instant messaging, presence) to provide a general framework for personalized service specification and execution."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9232","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9232","fieldValue":"HTTP"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9232","fieldValue":"SIP"}
