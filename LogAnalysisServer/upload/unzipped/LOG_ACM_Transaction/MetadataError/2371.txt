Energy accounting plays an essential role in revealing the contribution of each entity to the total consumption and for energy management. Unfortunately, energy accounting inherits the apportionment problem of accounting in general, which does not have a general single best solution. In this article, we leverage cooperative game theory, which is commonly used in cost allocation problems to study the energy apportionment problem, that is, the problem of prescribing the actual energy consumption of a system to the consuming entities (e.g., applications, processes, or users of the system). We identify five relevant fairness properties for energy apportionment and present a detailed categorisation and analysis of eight previously proposed energy apportionment policies from different fields in computer and communication systems. In addition, we propose two novel energy apportionment policies based on cooperative game theory that provide strong fairness notion and a rich incentive structure. Our comparative analysis in terms of the identified five fairness properties as well as information requirement and computational complexity shows that there is a tradeoff between fairness and the other evaluation criteria. We provide guidelines to select an energy apportionment policy depending on the purpose of the apportionment and the characteristics of the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17783","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Link&#246;ping University, Link&#246;ping, Sweden (Vergara, Ekhiotz Jon; Nadjm-Tehrani, Simin; Asplund, Mikael)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17783","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17783","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17784","fieldValue":" The costs incurred by cloud providers towards operating their data centers are often determined in large part by their peak demands. The pricing schemes currently used by cloud providers to recoup these costs from their tenants, however, do not distinguish tenants based on their contributions to the cloudâ\u20AC™s overall peak demand. Using the concrete example of peak-based pricing as employed by many electric utility companies, we show that this â\u20ACœgapâ\u20AC? may lead to unfair attribution of costs to the tenants. Simple enhancements of existing cloud pricing (e.g., analogous to the coincident peak pricing (CPP) used by some electric utilities) do not adequately address these shortcomings and suffer from short-term unfairness and undesirable oscillatory price-vs.-demand relationships offered to tenants. To overcome these shortcomings, we define an alternative pricing scheme to more fairly distribute a cloudâ\u20AC™s costs among its tenants. We demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme under price-sensitive tenant demand response using a combination of (i) extensive empirical evaluation with recent workloads from commercial data centers operated by IBM and (ii) analytical [modeling] through non-cooperative game theory for a special case of tenant demand model."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17784","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: IBM Research, Zurich, R&#252;schlikon, Switzerland (Chen, Lydia Y.; Birke, Robert); Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA (Nasiriani, Neda; Wang, Cheng; Kesidis, George; Urgaonkar, Bhuvan)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17784","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17784","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17785","fieldValue":" In this article, we investigate the traversal time of a file across N communication links subject to stochastic changes in the sending rate of each link.

Two cases, one where links evolve independently of one another (N mutually independent Markov processes) and the second where their behaviors are dependent (these N Markov processes are not mutually independent), are considered. A particular instance where the above is encountered is ad hoc delay\/tolerant networks where links are subject to intermittent unavailability."}
