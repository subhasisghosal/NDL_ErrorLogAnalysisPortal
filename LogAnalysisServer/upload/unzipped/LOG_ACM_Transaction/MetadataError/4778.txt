To help maintain consistency, a number of Information Management techniques have been developed. However, unless carefully tuned to the underlying network, they can negatively impact on consistency. This work presents a novel adaptive algorithm for optimizing consistency by maximizing available bandwidth usage in DIAs. This algorithm operates by estimating bandwidth from trends in network latency, and modifying data transmission rates to match the estimated value. Results presented within demonstrate that this approach can help optimise consistency levels in a DIA."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25385","fieldValue":" This article presents results from our measurement and modeling efforts on the large-scale peer-to-peer (p2p) overlay graphs spanned by the PPLive system, the most popular and largest p2p IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) system today. Unlike other previous studies on PPLive, which focused on either network-centric or user-centric measurements of the system, our study is unique in (a) focusing on PPLive overlay-specific characteristics, and (b) being the first to derive mathematical models for its distributions of node degree, session length, and peer participation in simultaneous overlays. Our studies reveal characteristics of multimedia streaming p2p overlays that are markedly different from existing file-sharing p2p overlays. Specifically, we find that: (1) PPLive overlays are similar to random graphs in structure and thus more robust and resilient to the massive failure of nodes, (2) Average degree of a peer in the overlay is independent of the channel population size and the node degree distribution can be fitted by a piecewise function, (3) The availability correlation between PPLive peer pairs is bimodal, that is, some pairs have highly correlated availability, while others have no correlation, (4) Unlike p2p file-sharing peers, PPLive peers are impatient and session lengths (discretized, per channel) are typically geometrically distributed, (5) Channel population size is time-sensitive, self-repeated, event-dependent, and varies more than in p2p file-sharing networks, (6) Peering relationships are slightly locality-aware, and (7) Peer participation in simultaneous overlays follows a Zipf distribution. We believe that our findings can be used to understand current large-scale p2p streaming systems for future planning of resource usage, and to provide useful and practical hints for future design of large-scale p2p streaming systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25385","fieldValue":"IPTV"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25385","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25385","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25386","fieldValue":" This article investigates a scenario of reuse in which existing learning resources serve as preliminary products for the creation of new learning resources. Authors should be able to reuse learning resources and also parts of them at different levels of granularity in a modular way. The requirements of multigranularity reuse are analyzed and compared to existing solutions. A concept for modular, multigranularity reuse is presented in this article. It is also shown how this kind of reuse can be achieved in practise."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25386","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25386","fieldValue":"ACM"}
