In contrast to previous methods which rely on labeled images provided by the user, this article attempts to enhance the performance of relevance feedback by exploiting unlabeled images existing in the database. Concretely, this article integrates the merits of semisupervised learning and active learning into the relevance feedback process. In detail, in each round of relevance feedback two simple learners are trained from the labeled data, that is, images from user query and user feedback. Each learner then labels some unlabeled images in the database for the other learner. After retraining with the additional labeled data, the learners reclassify the images in the database and then their classifications are merged. Images judged to be positive with high confidence are returned as the retrieval result, while those judged with low confidence are put into the pool which is used in the next round of relevance feedback. Experiments show that using semisupervised learning and active learning simultaneously in CBIR is beneficial, and the proposed method achieves better performance than some existing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23916","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23916","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23917","fieldValue":" With continued advances in communication network technology and sensing technology, there is astounding growth in the amount of data produced and made available through cyberspace. Efficient and high-quality clustering of large datasets continues to be one of the most important problems in large-scale data analysis. A commonly used methodology for cluster analysis on large datasets is the three-phase framework of sampling\/summarization, iterative cluster analysis, and disk-labeling. There are three known problems with this framework which demand effective solutions. The first problem is how to effectively define and validate irregularly shaped clusters, especially in large datasets. Automated algorithms and statistical methods are typically not effective in handling these particular clusters. The second problem is how to effectively label the entire data on disk (disk-labeling) without introducing additional errors, including the solutions for dealing with outliers, irregular clusters, and cluster boundary extension. The third obstacle is the lack of research about issues related to effectively integrating the three phases. In this article, we describe iVIBRATE---an interactive visualization-based three-phase framework for clustering large datasets. The two main components of iVIBRATE are its VISTA visual cluster-rendering subsystem which invites human interplay into the large-scale iterative clustering process through interactive visualization, and its adaptive ClusterMap labeling subsystem which offers visualization-guided disk-labeling solutions that are effective in dealing with outliers, irregular clusters, and cluster boundary extension. Another important contribution of iVIBRATE development is the identification of the special issues presented in integrating the two components and the sampling approach into a coherent framework, as well as the solutions for improving the reliability of the framework and for minimizing the amount of errors generated within the cluster analysis process. We study the effectiveness of the iVIBRATE framework through a walkthrough example dataset of a million records and we experimentally evaluate the iVIBRATE approach using both real-life and synthetic datasets. Our results show that iVIBRATE can efficiently involve the user in the clustering process and generate high-quality clustering results for large datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23917","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23917","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23918","fieldValue":" In information retrieval, retrieving relevant passages, as opposed to whole documents, not only directly benefits the end user by filtering out the irrelevant information within a long relevant document, but also improves retrieval accuracy in general. A critical problem in passage retrieval is to extract coherent relevant passages accurately from a document, which we refer to as passage extraction. While much work has been done on passage retrieval, the passage extraction problem has not been seriously studied. Most existing work tends to rely on presegmenting documents into fixed-length passages which are unlikely optimal because the length of a relevant passage is presumably highly sensitive to both the query and document.In this article, we present a new method for accurately detecting coherent relevant passages of variable lengths using hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM-based method naturally captures the topical boundaries between passages relevant and nonrelevant to the query. Pseudo-feedback mechanisms can be naturally incorporated into such an HMM-based framework to improve parameter estimation. We show that with appropriate parameter estimation, the HMM method outperforms a number of strong baseline methods on two datasets. We further show how the HMM method can be applied on top of any basic passage extraction method to improve passage boundaries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23919","fieldValue":"Sun, Jian-Tao"}
