For real-life garments, such transfer is performed through a knowledge intensive and time consuming process, known as pattern grading. Our first contribution is to reformulate the criteria used in professional pattern-grading as a set of geometric requirements, respectively expressing shape or design preservation, proportionality, and fit. We then propose a fully automatic garment transfer algorithm which satisfies all of these criteria while ensuring the physical plausibility of the result. Specifically, we formulate garment transfer as a constrained optimization problem and solve it efficiently through iterative quadratic minimization. As demonstrated by our results, our method is able to automatically generate design-preserving versions of existing garments for target characters whose proportions and body shape significantly differ from those of the source. The method correctly handles the transfer of multiple layers of garment. Lastly, when source 2D patterns are available, we output graded patterns suitable for manufacturing the transferred garments. Our fully automatic design-preserving transfer method leads to significant time savings for both computer artists and fashion designers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16625","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16625","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2576","fieldValue":" This article considers the problem of computing a minimum weight cycle in weighted undirected graphs. Given a weighted undirected graph G = (V,E,w), let C be a minimum weight cycle of G, let w(C) be the weight of C, and let $w_max(C) be the weight of the maximum edge of C. We obtain three new approximation algorithms for the minimum weight cycle problem: (1) for integral weights from the range [1,M], an algorithm that reports a cycle of weight at most 4 3w(C) in $O(n^2 log n(log n + log M)) time; (2) For integral weights from the range [1,M], an algorithm that reports a cycle of weight at most w(C) + wmax$(C) in O(n2 log n(log n + log M)) time; (3) For nonnegative real edge weights, an algorithm that for any Îµ > 0 reports a cycle of weight at most (4 3 + Îµ)w(C) in O(1 Îµ n2 log n(log log n)) time. In a recent breakthrough, Williams and Williams [2010] showed that a subcubic algorithm, that computes the exact minimum weight cycle in undirected graphs with integral weights from the range [1,M], implies a subcubic algorithm for computing all-pairs shortest paths in directed graphs with integral weights from the range [âˆ\u2019M,M]. This implies that in order to get a subcubic algorithm for computing a minimum weight cycle, we have to relax the problem and to consider an approximated solution. Lingas and Lundell [2009] were the first to consider approximation in the context of minimum weight cycle in weighted graphs. They presented a 2-approximation algorithm for integral weights with O(n2$ log n(log n + log M)) running time. They also posed, as an open problem, the question whether it is possible to obtain a subcubic algorithm with a c-approximation, where c < 2. The current article answers this question in the affirmative, by presenting an algorithm with 4\/3-approximation and the same running time. Surprisingly, the approximation factor of 4\/3 is not accidental. We show, using the new result of Williams and Williams [2010], that a subcubic combinatorial algorithm with (4\/3 âˆ\u2019 Îµ)-approximation, where 0 < Îµ â\u2030¤ 1\/3, implies a subcubic combinatorial algorithm for multiplying two boolean matrices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2576","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2576","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16626","fieldValue":" Recent yarn-based simulation techniques permit realistic and efficient dynamic simulation of knitted clothing, but producing the required yarn-level models remains a challenge. The lack of practical modeling techniques significantly limits the diversity and complexity of knitted garments that can be simulated. We propose a new modeling technique that builds yarn-level models of complex knitted garments for virtual characters. We start with a polygonal model that represents the large-scale surface of the knitted cloth. Using this mesh as an input, our interactive modeling tool produces a finer mesh representing the layout of stitches in the garment, which we call the stitch mesh. By manipulating this mesh and assigning stitch types to its faces, the user can replicate a variety of complicated knitting patterns. The curve model representing the yarn is generated from the stitch mesh, then the final shape is computed by a yarn-level physical simulation that locally relaxes the yarn into realistic shape while preserving global shape of the garment and avoiding \"yarn pull-through,\" thereby producing valid yarn geometry suitable for dynamic simulation. Using our system, we can efficiently create yarn-level models of knitted clothing with a rich variety of patterns that would be completely impractical to model using traditional techniques. We show a variety of example knitting patterns and full-scale garments produced using our system."}
