We use jitter-free probability as the main performance metric to study Quality of Data delivery (QoD). A new model that incorporates both bandwidth and data availability of P2P network is proposed. Our model relies on a sharing factor that models data availability among all peers. We simulate on a minimalistic network to demonstrate how to apply the analytical model to design a P2P video streaming system with a very low jitter rate. Our simulation experimental results reveal that the lower bound on jitter-free probability is indeed effective to reflect the QoD of the entire system. Our model captures the impact of many design choices, including upload bandwidth limit, peer selection strategies, and video stream chunking schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25438","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25438","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25439","fieldValue":" Large-scale live peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming applications have been successfully deployed in today's Internet. While they can accommodate hundreds of thousands of users simultaneously with hundreds of channels of programming, there still commonly exist channels and times where and when the streaming quality is unsatisfactory. In this paper, based on more than two terabytes and one year worth of live traces from UUSee, a large-scale commercial P2P live streaming system, we show an in-depth network-wide diagnosis of streaming inefficiencies, commonly present in typical mesh-based P2P live streaming systems. As the first highlight of our work, we identify an evolutionary pattern of low streaming quality in the system, and the distribution of streaming inefficiencies across various streaming channels and in different geographical regions. We then carry out an extensive investigation to explore the causes to such streaming inefficiencies over different times and across different channels\/regions at specific times, by investigating the impact of factors such as the number of peers, peer upload bandwidth, inter-peer bandwidth availability, server bandwidth consumption, and many more. The original discoveries we have brought forward include the two-sided effects of peer population on the streaming quality in a streaming channel, the significant impact of inter-peer bandwidth bottlenecks at peak times, and the inefficient utilization of server capacities across concurrent channels. Based on these insights, we identify problems within the existing P2P live streaming design and discuss a number of suggestions to improve real-world streaming protocols operating at a large scale."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25439","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25439","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25440","fieldValue":"Lau, Francis C M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25440","fieldValue":" Real-world large-scale Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Video-on-Demand (VoD) streaming applications face more design challenges as compared to P2P live streaming, due to higher peer dynamics and less buffer overlap. The situation is further complicated when we consider the selfish nature of peers, who in general wish to download more and upload less, unless otherwise motivated. Taking a new perspective of distributed dynamic auctions, we design efficient P2P VoD streaming algorithms with simultaneous consideration of peer incentives and streaming optimality. In our solution, media block exchanges among peers are carried out through local auctions, in which budget-constrained peers bid for desired blocks from their neighbors, which in turn deliver blocks to the winning bidders and collect revenue. With strategic design of a discriminative second price auction with seller reservation, a supplying peer has full incentive to maximally contribute its bandwidth to increase its budget; requesting peers are also motivated to bid in such a way that optimal media block scheduling is achieved effectively in a fully decentralized fashion. Applying techniques from convex optimization and mechanism design, we prove (a) the incentive compatibility at the selling and buying peers, and (b) the optimality of the induced media block scheduling in terms of social welfare maximization. Large-scale empirical studies are conducted to investigate the behavior of the proposed auction mechanisms in dynamic P2P VoD systems based on real-world settings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25440","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25440","fieldValue":"ACM"}
