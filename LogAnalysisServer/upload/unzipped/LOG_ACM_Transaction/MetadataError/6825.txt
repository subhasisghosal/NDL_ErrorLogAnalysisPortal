One major stock analysis method is the use of candlestick charts. However, candlestick chart analysis has usually been based on the utilization of numerical formulas. There has been no work taking advantage of an image processing technique to directly analyze the visual content of the candlestick charts for stock prediction. Therefore, in this study we apply the concept of image retrieval to extract seven different wavelet-based texture features from candlestick charts. Then, similar historical candlestick charts are retrieved based on different texture features related to the query chart, and the â\u20ACœfutureâ\u20AC? stock movements of the retrieved charts are used for stock prediction. To assess the applicability of this approach to stock prediction, two datasets are used, containing 5-year and 10-year training and testing sets, collected from the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (INDU) for the period between 1990 and 2009. Moreover, two datasets (2010 and 2011) are used to further validate the proposed approach. The experimental results show that visual content extraction and similarity matching of candlestick charts is a new and useful analytical method for stock prediction. More specifically, we found that the extracted feature vectors of 30, 90, and 120, the number of textual features extracted from the candlestick charts in the BMP format, are more suitable for predicting stock movements, while the 90 feature vector offers the best performance for predicting short- and medium-term stock movements. That is, using the 90 feature vector provides the lowest MAPE (3.031&percnt;) and Theilâ\u20AC™s U (1.988&percnt;) rates in the twenty-year dataset, and the best MAPE (2.625&percnt;, 2.945&percnt;) and Theilâ\u20AC™s U (1.622&percnt;, 1.972&percnt;) rates in the two validation datasets (2010 and 2011)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8210","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8210","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1112","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a self-configuring architecture for on-demand resource allocation to applications in a shared database cluster. We use a unified approach to load and fault management based on data replication and reactive replica provisioning. While data replication provides scaling and high availability, reactive provisioning dynamically allocates additional replicas to applications in response to peak loads or failure conditions, thus providing per application performance. We design an efficient method for data migration when joining a new replica to a running application that allows for the quick addition of replicas with minimal disruption of transaction processing. Furthermore, by augmenting the adaptation feedback loop with awareness of the delay introduced by the data migration process in our replicated system, we avoid oscillations in resource allocation.We investigate our transparent database provisioning mechanisms in the context of multitier dynamic content Web servers. We dynamically expand\/contract the respective allocations within the database tier for two different applications, the TPC-W e-commerce benchmark and the RUBIS online auction benchmark. We demonstrate that our techniques provide quality of service under different load and failure scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1112","fieldValue":"ACM"}
