Better utilization of network resources can be achieved, however, if congestion management algorithms can determine when two different flows share a congested link. Such knowledge can be used to implement cooperative congestion control or improve the overlay topology of a P2P system. Previous techniques to detect shared congestion either assume a common source or destination node, drop-tail queueing, or a single point of congestion. We propose in this paper a novel technique, applicable to any pair of paths on the Internet, without such limitations. Our technique employs a signal processing method, wavelet denoising, to separate queueing delay caused by network congestion from various other delay variations. Our wavelet-based technique is evaluated through both simulations and Internet experiments. We show that, when detecting shared congestion of paths with a common endpoint, our technique provides faster convergence and higher accuracy while using fewer packets than previous techniques, and that it also accurately determines when there is no shared congestion. Furthermore, we show that our technique is robust and accurate for paths without a common endpoint or synchronized clocks; more specifically, it can tolerate a synchronization offset of up to one second between two packet flows."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9757","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9757","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9757","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9758","fieldValue":" As the Internet infrastructure grows to support a variety of services, its legacy protocols are being overloaded with new functions such as traffic engineering. Today, operators engineer such capabilities through clever, but manual parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a back-end support tool for large-scale parameter configuration that is based on efficient parameter state space search techniques and on-line simulation. The framework is useful when the network protocol performance is sensitive to its parameter settings, and its performance can be reasonably modeled in simulation. In particular, our system imports the network topology, relevant protocol models and latest monitored traffic patterns into a simulation that runs on-line in a network operations center (NOC). Each simulation evaluates the network performance for a particular setting of protocol parameters. We propose an efficient large-dimensional parameter state space search technique called \"recursive random search (RRS).\" Each sample point chosen by RRS results in a single simulation. An important feature of this framework is its flexibility: it allows arbitrary choices in terms of the simulation engines used (e.g., ns-2, SSFnet), network protocols to be simulated (e.g., OSPF, BGP), and in the specification of the optimization objectives. We demonstrate the flexibility and relevance of this framework in three scenarios: joint tuning of the RED buffer management parameters at multiple bottlenecks, traffic engineering using OSPF link weight tuning, and outbound load-balancing of traffic at peering\/transit points using BGP LOCAL_PREF parameter."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9758","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9758","fieldValue":"ACM"}
