Shadow maps work well in regions that are completely in light or in shadow but result in objectionable artifacts near shadow boundaries. In contrast, shadow volumes generate precise shadow boundaries but require high fill rates. In this paper, we propose the method of silhouette maps, in which a shadow depth map is augmented by storing the location of points on the geometric silhouette. This allows the shader to construct a piecewise linear approximation to the true shadow silhouette, improving the visual quality over the piecewise constant approximation of conventional shadow maps. We demonstrate an implementation of our approach running on programmable graphics hardware in real-time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15329","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15329","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15330","fieldValue":"OSullivan, Carol"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15330","fieldValue":" For many systems that produce physically based animations, plausibility rather than accuracy is acceptable. We consider the problem of evaluating the visual quality of animations in which physical parameters have been distorted or degraded, either unavoidably due to real-time frame-rate requirements, or intentionally for aesthetic reasons. To date, no generic means of evaluating or predicting the fidelity, either physical or visual, of the dynamic events occurring in an animation exists. As a first step towards providing such a metric, we present a set of psychophysical experiments that established some thresholds for human sensitivity to dynamic anomalies, including angular, momentum and spatio-temporal distortions applied to simple animations depicting the elastic collision of two rigid objects. In addition to finding significant acceptance thresholds for these distortions under varying conditions, we identified some interesting biases that indicate non-symmetric responses to these distortions (e.g., expansion of the angle between post-collision trajectories was preferred to contraction and increases in velocity were preferred to decreases). Based on these results, we derived a set of probability functions that can be used to evaluate the visual fidelity of a physically based simulation. To illustrate how our results could be used, two simple case studies of simulation levels of detail and constrained dynamics are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15330","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15330","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15331","fieldValue":"Reitsma, Paul S A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15331","fieldValue":" Motion capture data and techniques for blending, editing, and sequencing that data can produce rich, realistic character animation; however, the output of these motion processing techniques sometimes appears unnatural. For example, the motion may violate physical laws or reflect unreasonable forces from the character or the environment. While problems such as these can be fixed, doing so is not yet feasible in real time environments. We are interested in developing ways to estimate perceived error in animated human motion so that the output quality of motion processing techniques can be better controlled to meet user goals.This paper presents results of a study of user sensitivity to errors in animated human motion. Errors were systematically added to human jumping motion, and the ability of subjects to detect these errors was measured. We found that users were able to detect motion with errors, and noted some interesting trends: errors in horizontal velocity were easier to detect than errors in vertical velocity, and added accelerations were easier to detect than added decelerations. On the basis of our results, we propose a perceptually based metric for measuring errors in ballistic human motion."}
