An important problem in this context is how to partition QoS requirements along a selected topology (path for unicast and tree for multicast). As networks grow in size, the scalability of the solution becomes increasingly important. This calls for efficient algorithms, whose computational complexity is less dependent on the network size. In addition, recently proposed precomputation-based methods can be employed to facilitate scalability by significantly reducing the time needed for handling incoming requests.We present a novel solution technique to the QoS partition problem(s), based on a \"divide-and-conquer\" scheme. As opposed to previous solutions, our technique considerably reduces the computational complexity in terms of dependence on network size; moreover, it enables the development of precomputation schemes. Hence, our technique provides a scalable approach to the QoS partition problem, for both unicast and multicast. In addition, our algorithms readily generalize to support QoS routing in typical settings of large-scale networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9396","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9396","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9396","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9397","fieldValue":" We develop a non-classic algebraic theory for the purpose of investigating the convergence properties of dynamic routing protocols. The algebraic theory can be regarded as a generalization of shortest-path routing, where the new concept of free cycle generalizes that of a positive-length cycle. A primary result then states that routing protocols always converge, though not necessarily onto optimal paths, in networks where all cycles are free. Monotonicity and isotonicity are two algebraic properties that strengthen convergence results. Monotonicity implies protocol convergence in every network, and isotonicity assures convergence onto optimal paths.A great many applications arise as particular instances of the algebraic theory. In intra-domain routing, we show that routing protocols can be made to converge to shortest and widest paths, for example, but that the composite metric of Internet Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) does not lead to optimal paths. The more interesting applications, however, relate to inter-domain routing and its Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), where the algebraic framework provides a mathematical template for the specification, design, and verification of routing policies. We formulate existing guidelines for inter-domain routing in algebraic terms, propose new guidelines contemplating backup relationships between domains, and derive a sufficient condition for signaling correctness of internal-BGP."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9397","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9398","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of precomputing constrained widest paths and multicast trees in a communication network. Precomputing and storing of the relevant information minimizes the computational overhead required to determine an optimal path when a new connection request arrives. We evaluate algorithms that precompute paths with maximal bandwidth (widest paths), which in addition satisfy given end-to-end delay constraints. We analyze and compare both the worst case and average case performance of the algorithms. We also show how the precomputed paths can be used to provide computationally efficient solutions to the constrained widest multicast tree problem. In this problem, a multicast tree with maximal bandwidth (widest multicast tree) is sought, which in addition satisfies given end-to-end delay constraints for each path on the tree from the source to a multicast destination."}
