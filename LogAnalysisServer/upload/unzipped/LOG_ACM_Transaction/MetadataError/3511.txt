In this article, an MAC protocol has been proposed which will utilize the adaptive spreading code length technique to increase network performance for these applications. In this architecture, the system can automatically determine the time varying channel quality and set the optimum spreading code length to maximize the throughput while minimizing the energy usage. Due to this adaptive feature, the system is able to deliver reliable wireless service even in the harsh RF environment. The design of such a protocol is also backwards compatible to enable its employment in both traditional and advanced WSN scenarios. Finally, the proposed protocol has been implemented in a COTS WSN platform to obtain the experimental result, which demonstrates the ability of being implemented on typical resource constraints WSN devices. The experimental results have shown the efficiency advantages of the proposed MAC protocol delivering 139&percnt; higher throughput as well as having better energy performance than the standard IEEE 802.15.4 system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21451","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21451","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3044","fieldValue":"A, Bharath"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3044","fieldValue":" Writer-specific character writing variations such as those of stroke order and stroke number are an important source of variability in the input when handwriting is captured â\u20ACœonlineâ\u20AC? via a stylus and a challenge for robust online recognition of handwritten characters and words. It has been shown by several studies that explicit modeling of character allographs is important for achieving high recognition accuracies in a writer-independent recognition system. While previous approaches have relied on unsupervised clustering at the character or stroke level to find the allographs of a character, in this article we propose the use of constrained clustering using automatically derived domain constraints to find a minimal set of stroke clusters. The allographs identified have been applied to Devanagari character recognition using Hidden Markov Models and Nearest Neighbor classifiers, and the results indicate substantial improvement in recognition accuracy and\/or reduction in memory and computation time when compared to alternate modeling techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3044","fieldValue":"Allograph modeling for online handwritten characters in devanagari using constrained stroke clustering"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21452","fieldValue":" In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), trap coverage has recently been proposed to trade off between the availability of sensor nodes and sensing performance. It offers an efficient framework to tackle the challenge of limited resources in large-scale sensor networks. Currently, existing works only studied the theoretical foundation of how to decide the deployment density of sensors to ensure the desired degree of trap coverage. However, practical issues, such as how to efficiently schedule sensor node to guarantee trap coverage under an arbitrary deployment, are still left untouched. In this article, we formally formulate the Minimum Weight Trap Cover Problem and prove it is an NP-hard problem. To solve the problem, we introduce a bounded approximation algorithm, called Trap Cover Optimization (TCO) to schedule the activation of sensors while satisfying specified trap coverage requirement. We design Localized Trap Coverage Protocol as the localized implementation of TCO. The performance of Minimum Weight Trap Coverage we find is proved to be at most O(Ï?) times of the optimal solution, where Ï? is the density of sensor nodes in the region. To evaluate our design, we perform extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and show that our algorithm achieves at least 14&percnt; better energy efficiency than the state-of-the-art solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21452","fieldValue":"ACM"}
