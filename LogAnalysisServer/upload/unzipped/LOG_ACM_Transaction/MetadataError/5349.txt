Graphs are general modeling tools to organize information from heterogeneous sources and have been applied in many scientific, engineering, and business fields. With the fast accumulation of graph data, building highly accurate predictive models for graph data emerges as a new challenge that has not been fully explored in the data mining community. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel technique called graph pattern diffusion (GPD) kernel. Our idea is to leverage existing frequent pattern discovery methods and to explore the application of kernel classifier (e.g., support vector machine) in building highly accurate graph classification. In our method, we first identify all frequent patterns from a graph database. We then map subgraphs to graphs in the graph database and use a process we call \"pattern diffusionâ\u20AC? to label nodes in the graphs. Finally, we designed a graph alignment algorithm to compute the inner product of two graphs. We have tested our algorithm using a number of chemical structure data. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is significantly better than competing methods such as those kernel functions based on paths, cycles, and subgraphs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4482","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4482","fieldValue":"GPD: A Graph Pattern Diffusion Kernel for Accurate Graph Classification with Applications in Cheminformatics"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4482","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4482","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4483","fieldValue":" The recent advent of high-throughput methods has generated large amounts of gene interaction data. This has allowed the construction of genomewide networks. A significant number of genes in such networks remain uncharacterized and predicting the molecular function of these genes remains a major challenge. A number of existing techniques assume that genes with similar functions are topologically close in the network. Our hypothesis is that genes with similar functions observe similar annotation patterns in their neighborhood, regardless of the distance between them in the interaction network. We thus predict molecular functions of uncharacterized genes by comparing their functional neighborhoods to genes of known function. We propose a two-phase approach. First, we extract functional neighborhood features of a gene using Random Walks with Restarts. We then employ a KNN classifier to predict the function of uncharacterized genes based on the computed neighborhood features. We perform leave-one-out validation experiments on two S. cerevisiae interaction networks and show significant improvements over previous techniques. Our technique provides a natural control of the trade-off between accuracy and coverage of prediction. We further propose and evaluate prediction in sparse genomes by exploiting features from well-annotated genomes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4483","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4484","fieldValue":" Phylogenetic networks are leaf-labeled, rooted, acyclic, and directed graphs that are used to model reticulate evolutionary histories. Several measures for quantifying the topological dissimilarity between two phylogenetic networks have been devised, each of which was proven to be a metric on certain restricted classes of phylogenetic networks. A biologically motivated class of phylogenetic networks, namely, reduced phylogenetic networks, was recently introduced. None of the existing measures is a metric on the space of reduced phylogenetic networks. In this paper, we provide a metric on the space of reduced phylogenetic networks that is computable in time polynomial in the size of the networks."}
