Specifically, the problem of linear separability for pairs of genes is investigated. If a pair of genes exhibits linear separation with respect to the two classes, then the joint expression level of the two genes is strongly correlated to the phenomena of the sample being taken from one class or the other. This may indicate an underlying molecular mechanism relating the two genes and the phenomena(e.g., a specific cancer). We developed and implemented novel efficient algorithmic tools for finding all pairs of genes that induce a linear separation of the two sample classes. These tools are based on computational geometric properties and were applied to 10 publicly available cancer data sets. For each data set, we computed the number of actual separating pairs and compared it to an upper bound on the number expected by chance and to the numbers resulting from shuffling the labels of the data at random empirically. Seven out of these 10 data sets are highly separable. Statistically, this phenomenon is highly significant, very unlikely to occur at random. It is therefore reasonable to expect that it manifests a functional association between separating genes and the underlying phenotypic classes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4498","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4127","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4499","fieldValue":" We present the results of the BioCreative II.5 evaluation in association with the FEBS Letters experiment, where authors created Structured Digital Abstracts to capture information about protein-protein interactions. The BioCreative II.5 challenge evaluated automatic annotations from 15 text mining teams based on a gold standard created by reconciling annotations from curators, authors, and automated systems. The tasks were to rank articles for curation based on curatable protein-protein interactions; to identify the interacting proteins (using UniProt identifiers) in the positive articles (61); and to identify interacting protein pairs. There were 595 full-text articles in the evaluation test set, including those both with and without curatable protein interactions. The principal evaluation metrics were the interpolated area under the precision\/recall curve (AUC iP\/R), and (balanced) F-measure. For article classification, the best AUC iP\/R was 0.70; for interacting proteins, the best system achieved good macroaveraged recall (0.73) and interpolated area under the precision\/recall curve (0.58), after filtering incorrect species and mapping homonymous orthologs; for interacting protein pairs, the top (filtered, mapped) recall was 0.42 and AUC iP\/R was 0.29. Ensemble systems improved performance for the interacting protein task."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4499","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
