Each version (or representation) is characterized by a resolution and a bit rate, and it is aimed at a specific set of users, like TV or mobile phone clients. While most existing works on adaptive streaming deal with effective playout-buffer control strategies on the client side, in this article we take a providers' perspective and propose solutions to improve user satisfaction by optimizing the set of available representations. We formulate an integer linear program that maximizes users' average satisfaction, taking into account network dynamics, type of video content, and user population characteristics. The solution of the optimization is a set of encoding parameters corresponding to the representations set that maximizes user satisfaction. We evaluate this solution by simulating multiple adaptive streaming sessions characterized by realistic network statistics, showing that the proposed solution outperforms commonly used vendor recommendations, in terms of user satisfaction but also in terms of fairness and outage probability. The simulation results show that video content information as well as network constraints and users' statistics play a crucial role in selecting proper encoding parameters to provide fairness among users and to reduce network resource usage. We finally propose a few theoretical guidelines that can be used, in realistic settings, to choose the encoding parameters based on the user characteristics, the network capacity and the type of video content."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25677","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25677","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25678","fieldValue":" Online video-on-demand(VoD) services invariably maintain a view count for each video they serve, and it has become an important currency for various stakeholders, from viewers, to content owners, advertizers, and the online service providers themselves. There is often significant financial incentive to use a robot (or a botnet) to artificially create fake views. How can we detect fake views&quest; Can we detect them (and stop them) efficiently&quest; What is the extent of fake views with current VoD service providers&quest; These are the questions we study in this article.

We created the personalized avatars with a full-body 3D scanner that records the participants' body geometry and texture. We altered the weight of the personalized avatars to produce changes in BMI while keeping height, arm length, and inseam fixed and exploited the correlation between body geometry and anthropometric measurements encapsulated in a statistical body shape model created from thousands of body scans. In a 2 Ã\u2014 2 psychophysical experiment, we investigated the relative importance of visual cues, namely shape (own shape vs. an average female body shape with equivalent height and BMI to the participant) and texture (own photo-realistic texture or checkerboard pattern texture) on the ability to accurately perceive own current body weight (by asking the participant, â\u20ACœIs it the same weight as you&quest;â\u20AC?). Our results indicate that shape (where height and BMI are fixed) had little effect on the perception of body weight. Interestingly, the participants perceived their body weight veridically when they saw their own photo-realistic texture. As compared to avatars with photo-realistic texture, the avatars with checkerboard texture needed to be significantly thinner in order to represent the participants' current weight. This suggests that in general the avatars with checkerboard texture appeared bigger. The range that the participants accepted as their own current weight was approximately a 0.83&percnt; to âˆ\u2019 6.05&percnt; BMI change tolerance range around their perceived weight. Both the shape and the texture had an effect on the reported similarity of the body parts and the whole avatar to the participant's body. This work has implications for new measures for patients with body image disorders, as well as researchers interested in creating personalized avatars for games, training applications, or virtual reality."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3478","fieldValue":"BMI"}
