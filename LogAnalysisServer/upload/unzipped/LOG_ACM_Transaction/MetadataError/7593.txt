In this paper, we propose a general framework for designing topology inference algorithms based on additive metrics. The framework can flexibly fuse information from multiple measurements to achieve better estimation accuracy. We develop computationally efficient (polynomial-time) topology inference algorithms based on the framework. We prove that the probability of correct topology inference of our algorithms converges to one exponentially fast in the number of probing packets. In particular, for applications where nodes may join or leave frequently such as overlay network construction, application-layer multicast, and peer-to-peer file sharing\/streaming, we propose a novel sequential topology inference algorithm that significantly reduces the probing overhead and can efficiently handle node dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed inference algorithms via Internet experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9996","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9996","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9996","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1907","fieldValue":" We propose a reduced-port Register File (RF) architecture for reducing RF energy in a VLIW processor. With port reduction, RF ports need to be shared among Function Units (FUs), which may lead to access conflicts, and thus, reduced performance. Our solution includes (i) a carefully designed RF-FU interconnection network that permits port sharing with minimum conflicts and without any delay\/energy overheads, and (ii) a novel scheduling and binding algorithm that reduces the performance penalty. With our solution, we observed as much as 83&percnt; RF energy savings with no more than a 10&percnt; loss in performance for a set of Mediabench and Mibench benchmarks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1907","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1907","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9997","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose to tackle the problem of updating the access network in order to connect new subscribers and to satisfy the new class of service requirements for the existing subscribers to offer, for instance, new services such as high-definition television (HDTV) over the Internet protocol (IPTV). Four important access network architectures\/technologies are considered: the digital subscriber line (xDSL) technologies deployed directly from the central office (CO), the fiber-to-the-node (FTTN), the fiber-to-the-micro-node (FTTn) and the fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP). An integer mathematical programming model is proposed for this network planning problem. Next, a heuristic algorithm based on the tabu search principle is proposed to find \"good\" feasible solutions within a reasonable amount of computational time. Finally, numerical results are presented and analyzed. To assess the quality of the solutions found with the proposed algorithm, they are compared to the optimal solutions found using a commercial implementation of the branch-and-bound algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9997","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
