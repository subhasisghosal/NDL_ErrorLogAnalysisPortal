Moreover, incorrect protein targeting can lead to pathological conditions. Recently, the application of evanescent wave microscopy has allowed us to image the final steps of exocytosis. However, spatio-temporal analysis of fusion of constitutive vesicular traffic with the plasma membrane has not been systematically performed. Also, the spatial sites and times of vesicle fusion have not yet been analyzed together. In addition, more formal tests are required in testing biological hypotheses, rather than visual inspection combined with statistical descriptives. Ripley {\\cal K}{\\hbox{-}}{\\rm functions} are used to examine the joint and marginal behavior of locations and fusion times. Semiautomatic detection and mapping of constitutive fusion sites reveals spatial and temporal clustering, but no dependency between the locations and times of fusion events. Our novel approach could be translated to other studies of membrane trafficking in health and diseases such as diabetes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4225","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4225","fieldValue":"Spatio-temporal clustering, exocytosis, epithelial cells, total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy (TIRFM)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4225","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4225","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4226","fieldValue":" Local conformation is an important determinant of RNA catalysis and binding. The analysis of RNA conformation is particularly difficult due to the large number of degrees of freedom (torsion angles) per residue. Proteins, by comparison, have many fewer degrees of freedom per residue. In this work, we use and extend classical tools from statistics and signal processing to search for clusters in RNA conformational space. Results are reported both for scalar analysis, where each torsion angle is separately studied, and for vectorial analysis, where several angles are simultaneously clustered. Adapting techniques from vector quantization and clustering to the RNA structure, we find torsion angle clusters and RNA conformational motifs. We validate the technique using well-known conformational motifs, showing that the simultaneous study of the total torsion angle space leads to results consistent with known motifs reported in the literature and also to the finding of new ones."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4226","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4226","fieldValue":"RNA backbone, statistical analysis, vector quantization, local conformations, torsion angles, conformational motifs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4226","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4226","fieldValue":"ACM"}
