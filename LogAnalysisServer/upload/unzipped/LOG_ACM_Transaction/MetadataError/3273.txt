Learning from mistakes is important not just in human learning activities; it is also a crucial ingredient in techniques for the developments of student models. In this article, we report findings of our study on 4,100 erroneous Chinese words. Seventy-six percent of these errors were related to the phonological similarity between the correct and the incorrect characters, 46&percnt; were due to visual similarity, and 29&percnt; involved both factors. We propose a computing algorithm that aims at replication of incorrect Chinese words. The algorithm extends the principles of decomposing Chinese characters with the Cangjie codes to judge the visual similarity between Chinese characters. The algorithm also employs empirical rules to determine the degree of similarity between Chinese phonemes. To show its effectiveness, we ran the algorithm to select and rank a list of about 100 candidate characters, from more than 5,100 characters, for the incorrectly written character in each of the 4,100 errors. We inspected whether the incorrect character was indeed included in the candidate list and analyzed whether the incorrect character was ranked at the top of the candidate list. Experimental results show that our algorithm captured 97&percnt; of incorrect characters for the 4,100 errors, when the average length of the candidate lists was 104. Further analyses showed that the incorrect characters ranked among the top 10 candidates in 89&percnt; of the phonologically similar errors and in 80&percnt; of the visually similar errors."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2985","fieldValue":"Visually and Phonologically Similar Characters in Incorrect Chinese Words: Analyses, Identification, and Applications"}
