The placement problem has been studied extensively in the past 30 years. However, recent studies show that existing placement solutions are surprisingly far from optimal. The first part of this tutorial summarizes results from recent optimality and scalability studies of existing placement tools. These studies show that the results of leading placement tools from both industry and academia may be up to 50&percent; to 150&percent; away from optimal in total wirelength. If such a gap can be closed, the corresponding performance improvement will be equivalent to several technology-generation advancements. The second part of the tutorial highlights the recent progress on large-scale circuit placement, including techniques for wirelength minimization, routability optimization, and performance optimization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12924","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12924","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12925","fieldValue":" Heterogeneous multiprocessing is the future of chip design with the potential for tens to hundreds of programmable elements on single chips within the next several years. These chips will have heterogeneous, programmable hardware elements that lead to different execution times for the same software executing on different resources as well as a mix of desktop-style and embedded-style software. They will also have a layer of programming across multiple programmable elements forming the basis of a new kind of programmable system which we refer to as a Programmable Heterogeneous Multiprocessor (PHM). Current modeling approaches use instruction set simulation for performance modeling, but this will become far too prohibitive in terms of simulation time for these larger designs. The fundamental question is what the next higher level of design will be. The high-level modeling, simulation and design required for these programmable systems poses unique challenges, representing a break from traditional hardware design. Programmable systems, including layered concurrent software executing via schedulers on concurrent hardware, are not characterizable with traditional component-based hierarchical composition approaches, including discrete event simulation. We describe the foundations of our layered approach to modeling and performance simulation of PHMs, showing an example design space of a network processor explored using our simulation approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2230","fieldValue":"Lpez-Ortiz, Alejandro"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2230","fieldValue":"Foreword"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2230","fieldValue":"ACM"}
