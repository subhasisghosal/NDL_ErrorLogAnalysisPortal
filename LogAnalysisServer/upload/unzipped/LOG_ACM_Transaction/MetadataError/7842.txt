{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10497","fieldValue":" We show that several important resource allocation problems in wireless networks fit within the common framework of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Inspired by the requirements of these applications, where variables are located at distinct network devices that may not be able to communicate but may interfere, we define natural criteria that a CSP solver must possess in order to be practical. We term these algorithms decentralized CSP solvers. The best known CSP solvers were designed for centralized problems and do not meet these criteria. We introduce a stochastic decentralized CSP solver, proving that it will find a solution in almost surely finite time, should one exist, and also showing it has many practically desirable properties. We benchmark the algorithm's performance on a well-studied class of CSPs, random k-SAT, illustrating that the time the algorithm takes to find a satisfying assignment is competitive with stochastic centralized solvers on problems with order a thousand variables despite its decentralized nature. We demonstrate the solver's practical utility for the problems that motivated its introduction by using it to find a noninterfering channel allocation for a network formed from data from downtown Manhattan."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10497","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10497","fieldValue":"TDMA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10498","fieldValue":" We consider a family of stochastic processes built from infinite sums of independent positive random functions on R+. Each of these functions increases linearly between two consecutive negative jumps, with the jump points following a Poisson point process on R+. The motivation for studying these processes stems from the fact that they constitute simplified models for TCP traffic. Such processes bear some analogy with Lévy processes, but aremore complex since their increments are neither stationary nor independent. In the work of Barral and Lévy Véhel, the Hausdorff multifractal spectrum of these processes was computed. We are interested here in their Large Deviation and Legendre multifractal spectra. These \"statistical\" spectra are seen to give, in this case, a richer information than the \"geometrical\" Hausdorff spectrum. In addition, our results provide a firm theoretical basis for the empirical discovery of the multifractal nature of TCP traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10498","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/10498","fieldValue":"H&#246;lder regularity"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10498","fieldValue":"Large deviation multifractal analysis of a class of additive processes with correlated nonstationary increments"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10498","fieldValue":"ACM"}
