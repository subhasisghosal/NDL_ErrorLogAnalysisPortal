We investigated this issue for locomotor behavior and tested the generality of Fajen and Warren's [2003] steering dynamics model. Participants walked to a stationary goal while avoiding a stationary obstacle in matched physical and virtual environments. There were small, but reliable, differences in locomotor paths, with a larger maximum deviation (Î\u201D &equals; 0.16 m), larger obstacle clearance (Î\u201D &equals; 0.16 m), and slower walking speed (Î\u201D &equals; 0.13 m\/s) in the virtual environment. Separate model fits closely captured the mean virtual and physical paths $(R^2 > 0.98). Simulations implied that the path differences are not because of walking speed or a 50&percnt; distance compression in virtual environments, but might be a result of greater uncertainty about the egocentric location of virtual obstacles. On the other hand, paths had similar shapes in the two environments with no difference in median curvature and could be modeled with a single set of parameter values (R2 > 0.95). Fajen and Warren's original parameters successfully generalized to new virtual and physical object configurations (R2$ > 0.95). These results justify the use of virtual environments to study locomotor behavior."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3291","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3291","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23618","fieldValue":" Handmarkings or handwritten editing marks can be used as direct editing commands to an interactive computer system. Five exploratory experiments studied the potential value of handmarkings for editing text and pictures, as well as for some specific results. Circles are the most frequently used scoping mark, and arrows are the most frequently used operator and target indicators. Experimental comparisons showed that handmarkings have the potential to be faster than keyboards and mice for editing tasks. Their ultimate value will, however, depend on the style and details of their user-interface implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23619","fieldValue":" A thesaurus can be a critical component of an office information system. Access to various sets of documents can be facilitated by thesauri and by the connections that are made among thesauri. In the projects described in this paper, the thesauri are stored and manipulated through a relational database management system. The system detects inheritance properties in a thesaurus and uses them to guide a human expert in decisions about how to augment the thesaurus. New strategies will extend our ability to augment existing thesauri."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23620","fieldValue":"Whang, Kyu-Young"}
