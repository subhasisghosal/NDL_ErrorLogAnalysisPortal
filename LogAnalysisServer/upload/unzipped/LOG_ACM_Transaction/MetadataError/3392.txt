{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21090","fieldValue":" As the popularity of NAND flash expands in arenas from embedded systems to high-performance computing, a high-fidelity understanding of its specific properties becomes increasingly important. Further, with the increasing trend toward multiple-die, multiple-plane architectures and high-speed interfaces, flash memory systems are expected to continue to scale and cheapen, resulting in their broader proliferation. However, when designing NAND-based devices, making decisions about the optimal system configuration is nontrivial, because flash is sensitive to a number of parameters and suffers from inherent latency variations, and no available tools suffice for studying these nuances. The parameters include the architectures, such as multidie and multiplane, diverse node technologies, bit densities, and cell reliabilities. Therefore, we introduce NANDFlashSim, a high-fidelity, latency-variation-aware, and highly configurable NAND-flash simulator, which implements a detailed timing model for 16 state-of-the-art NAND operations. Using NANDFlashSim, we notably discover the following. First, regardless of the operation, reads fail to leverage internal parallelism. Second, MLC provides lower I\/O bus contention than SLC, but contention becomes a serious problem as the number of dies increases. Third, many-die architectures outperform many-plane architectures for disk-friendly workloads. Finally, employing a high-performance I\/O bus or an increased page size does not enhance energy savings.

This article proposes a new priority-based multi-data resources management model, with a new algorithm called Fused Conversion algorithm from Multi-Data resources (FCMD), to ensure more context-sensitive, human controllable, and thus more reliable conversions, by drawing on reverse maximum matching, n-gram-based statistical model and pattern-based learning and matching. After parameter training on the Tagged Chinese Gigaword corpus, its conversion precision reaches 91.5&percnt; in context-sensitive cases, the most difficult part in the conversion, with an overall precision rate at 99.8&percnt;, a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art models. The conversion platform based on the model has extra features such as data resource selection and n-grams self-learning ability, providing a more sophisticated tool good especially for high-end professional uses."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21091","fieldValue":" Storing large amounts of data for different users has become the new normal in a modern distributed cloud storage environment. Storing data successfully requires a balance of availability, reliability, cost, and performance. Typically, systems design for this balance with minimal information about the data that will pass through them. We propose a series of methods to derive groupings from data that have predictive value, informing layout decisions for data on disk. Unlike previous grouping work, we focus on dynamically identifying groupings in data that can be gathered from active systems in real time with minimal impact using spatiotemporal locality. We outline several techniques we have developed and discuss how we select particular techniques for particular workloads and application domains. Our statistical and machine-learning-based grouping algorithms answer questions such as â\u20ACœWhat can a grouping be based on?â\u20AC? and â\u20ACœIs a given grouping meaningful for a given application?â\u20AC? We design our models to be flexible and require minimal domain information so that our results are as broadly applicable as possible. We intend for this work to provide a launchpad for future specialized system design using groupings in combination with caching policies and architectural distinctions such as tiered storage to create the next generation of scalable storage systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21091","fieldValue":"Can We Group Storage?
