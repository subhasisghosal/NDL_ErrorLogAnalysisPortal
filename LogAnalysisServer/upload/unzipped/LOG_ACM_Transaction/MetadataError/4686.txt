This technique usually involves a process called interest matching, which determines what data should be sent to the participants as well as what data should be filtered. Although most of the existing interest matching approaches have been shown to meet their runtime performance requirements, they have a fundamental disadvantageâ\u20AC\u201Dthey perform interest matching at discrete time intervals. As a result, they would fail to report events between discrete timesteps. If participants of the DVE ignore these missing events, they would most likely perform incorrect simulations. This article presents a new approach called space-time interest matching, which aims to capture the missing events between discrete timesteps. Although this approach requires additional matching effort, a number of novel algorithms are developed to significantly improve its runtime efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25101","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25101","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25102","fieldValue":"Perumalla, Kalyan S"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25102","fieldValue":"Park, Alfred J"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25102","fieldValue":" Global Virtual Time (GVT) computation is a key determinant of the efficiency and runtime dynamics of Parallel Discrete Event Simulations (PDES), especially on large-scale parallel platforms. Here, three execution modes of a generalized GVT computation algorithm are studied on high-performance parallel computing systems: (1) a synchronous GVT algorithm that affords ease of implementation, (2) an asynchronous GVT algorithm that is more complex to implement but can relieve blocking latencies, and (3) a variant of the asynchronous GVT algorithm to exploit one-sided communication in extant supercomputing platforms. Performance results are presented of implementations of these algorithms on up to 216,000 cores of a Cray XT5 system, exercised on a range of parameters: optimistic and conservative synchronization, fine- to medium-grained event computation, synthetic and nonsynthetic applications, and different lookahead values. Detailed PDES-specific runtime metrics are presented to further the understanding of tightly coupled discrete event dynamics on massively parallel platforms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25102","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25102","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25103","fieldValue":" Smoothed functional (SF) schemes for gradient estimation are known to be efficient in stochastic optimization algorithms, especially when the objective is to improve the performance of a stochastic system. However, the performance of these methods depends on several parameters, such as the choice of a suitable smoothing kernel. Different kernels have been studied in the literature, which include Gaussian, Cauchy, and uniform distributions, among others. This article studies a new class of kernels based on the q-Gaussian distribution, which has gained popularity in statistical physics over the last decade. Though the importance of this family of distributions is attributed to its ability to generalize the Gaussian distribution, we observe that this class encompasses almost all existing smoothing kernels. This motivates us to study SF schemes for gradient estimation using the q-Gaussian distribution. Using the derived gradient estimates, we propose two-timescale algorithms for optimization of a stochastic objective function in a constrained setting with a projected gradient search approach. We prove the convergence of our algorithms to the set of stationary points of an associated ODE. We also demonstrate their performance numerically through simulations on a queuing model."}
