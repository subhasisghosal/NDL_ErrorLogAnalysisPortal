In this article, the coexistence of BANs is experimentally performed. A relay-assisted cooperative communications scheme is implemented in a real IEEE 802.15.4-based BAN system with a beacon-enabled mode and guaranteed time slot (GTS) scheduling. As far as we know, it is the first experimental work that enables real-time investigation of the effectiveness of cooperative communications in BANs for co-channel radio interference mitigation. First- and second-order statistics, including outage probability, level crossing rate (LCR), and average fade\/nonfade duration, are calculated from the measured effective channel gains of the device-to-coordinator links across all superframes. Empirical results demonstrate significant advantages of using two-hop relay-assisted communications over traditional star topology BAN. Advantages include a maximum of a 10dB increase in channel gain threshold at an outage probability of 10&percnt;, which corresponds to a guideline for a 10&percnt; maximum packet error rate as specified in the IEEE BAN standard; a reduction in the level crossing rate by a factor of 5 at a channel gain threshold of âˆ\u2019 100dB; and an average nonfade duration prolonged by a factor of 5 at the same threshold."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21628","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21628","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21629","fieldValue":" Long-range radio can connect sensors\/IoT devices without complex and costly deployment of relay nodes. However, this flexibility comes with stricter legal regulations such as maximum radio activity time per 1-hour period. Under such constraints it is difficult to provide service guarantees, which is quite paradoxical when devices are deployed for surveillance systems. The approach we propose allows devices to go â\u20ACœexceptionallyâ\u20AC? beyond the activity time limitation by borrowing time from other devices. The mechanism is not intended to be used on a regular basis, where a device is commissioned to always report data at a rate that makes it consuming more than the allowed duty-cycle limitation, but to offer a â\u20ACœlast chanceâ\u20AC? solution for providing better surveillance service guarantees while globally satisfying duty-cycle regulations. The proposition has been implemented on our long-range image sensor platform, and preliminary experiments show that it can maintain the systemâ\u20AC™s consistency and keep the number of control messages small while being capable of handling sleep-wakeup behavior and dynamic insertion of new devices. Although initially targeted for image sensors, the proposition can also be deployed to increase the quality of service of traditional sensors by guaranteeing that important messages can be sent despite the duty-cycle regulation limit."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21629","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21629","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3072","fieldValue":" The rapid growth of the Internet and other computing facilities in recent years has resulted in the creation of a large amount of text in electronic form, which has increased the interest in and importance of different automatic text processing applications, including keyword extraction and term indexing. Although keywords are very useful for many applications, most documents available online are not provided with keywords. We describe a method for extracting keywords from Arabic documents. This method identifies the keywords by combining linguistics and statistical analysis of the text without using prior knowledge from its domain or information from any related corpus. The text is preprocessed to extract the main linguistic information, such as the roots and morphological patterns of derivative words. A cleaning phase is then applied to eliminate the meaningless words from the text. The most frequent terms are clustered into equivalence classes in which the derivative words generated from the same root and the non-derivative words generated from the same stem are placed together, and their count is accumulated. A vector space model is then used to capture the most frequent N-gram in the text. Experiments carried out using a real-world dataset show that the proposed method achieves good results with an average precision of 31% and average recall of 53% when tested against manually assigned keywords."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3072","fieldValue":"ACM"}
