A fundamental open question in numerical analysis and computational geometry is whether &mid;S&mid; â\u2030¥ 1\/2(n Â·log N)O(1) when S â\u2030  0. We study a formulation of this problem over polynomials. Given an expression S = âˆ\u2018i=1n ci Â· âˆšfi(x), where ciâ\u20AC™s belong to a field of characteristic 0 and fiâ\u20AC™s are univariate polynomials with degree bounded by d and fi(0)â\u2030 0 for all i, is it true that the minimum exponent of x that has a nonzero coefficient in the power series S is upper bounded by (n Â· d)O(1), unless S = 0? We answer this question affirmatively. Further, we show that this result over polynomials can be used to settle (positively) the sum of square roots problem for a special class of integers: Suppose each integer ai is of the form, ai = Xdi + bi1Xdiâˆ\u20191 +...+ bidi, di > 0, where X is a positive real number and bijâ\u20AC™s are integers. Let B = max ({&mid;bij&mid;}i, j, 1) and d = maxi{di}. If X > (B + 1)(nÂ·d)O(1) then a nonzero S = âˆ\u2018i=1n Î\u201Di Â· âˆšai$ is lower bounded as &mid;S&mid; â\u2030¥ 1\/X(nÂ·d)O(1). The constant in O(1), as fixed by our analysis, is roughly 2. We then consider the following more general problem. Given an arithmetic circuit computing a multivariate polynomial f(X) and integer d, is the degree of f(X) less than or equal to d? We give a coRPPP$-algorithm for this problem, improving previous results of Allender et al. [2009] and Koiran and Perifel [2007]."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12487","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12487","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12488","fieldValue":" We show a parallel-repetition theorem for constant-round Arthur-Merlin Proofs, using an efficient reduction.
