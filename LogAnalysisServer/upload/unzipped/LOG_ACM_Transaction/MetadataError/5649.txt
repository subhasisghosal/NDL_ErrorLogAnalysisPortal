Despite much evidence that there is widespread conformational polymorphism in protein side chains, most of the X-ray crystallography data are modeled by single conformations in the Protein Data Bank. The ability to extract or to predict these conformational polymorphisms is of crucial importance, as it facilitates deeper understanding of protein dynamics and functionality. In this paper, we describe a computational strategy capable of predicting side-chain polymorphisms. Our approach extends a particular class of algorithms for side-chain prediction by modeling the side-chain dihedral angles more appropriately as continuous rather than discrete variables. Employing a new inferential technique known as particle belief propagation, we predict residue-specific distributions that encode information about side-chain polymorphisms. Our predicted polymorphisms are in relatively close agreement with results from a state-of-the-art approach based on X-ray crystallography data, which characterizes the conformational polymorphisms of side chains using electron density information, and has successfully discovered previously unmodeled conformations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5019","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5019","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5019","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5020","fieldValue":" The rapid development of high-throughput technologies enables researchers to sequence the whole metagenome of a microbial community sampled directly from the environment. The assignment of these sequence reads into different species or taxonomical classes is a crucial step for metagenomic analysis, which is referred to as binning of metagenomic data. Most traditional binning methods rely on known reference genomes for accurate assignment of the sequence reads, therefore cannot classify reads from unknown species without the help of close references. To overcome this drawback, unsupervised learning based approaches have been proposed, which need not any known species' reference genome for help. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method called MCluster for binning metagenomic sequences. This method uses N-grams to extract sequence features and utilizes automatic feature weighting to improve the performance of the basic K-means clustering algorithm. We evaluate MCluster on a variety of simulated data sets and a real data set, and compare it with three latest binning methods: AbundanceBin, MetaCluster 3.0, and MetaCluster 5.0. Experimental results show that MCluster achieves obviously better overall performance (F-measure) than AbundanceBin and MetaCluster 3.0 on long metagenomic reads (â\u2030¥800 bp); while compared with MetaCluster 5.0, MCluster obtains a larger sensitivity, and a comparable yet more stable F-measure on short metagenomic reads ("}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5020","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5020","fieldValue":"A new unsupervised binning approach for metagenomic sequences based on N-grams and automatic feature weighting"}
