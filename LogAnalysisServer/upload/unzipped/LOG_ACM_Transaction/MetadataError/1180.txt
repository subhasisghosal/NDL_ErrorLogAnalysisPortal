This article addresses the challenge of optimizing the query performance while satisfying given location privacy and query accuracy requirements. The article's proposal, SpaceTwist, aims to offer location privacy for k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries at low communication cost without requiring a trusted anonymizer. The solution can be used with a conventional DBMS as well as with a server optimized for location-based services. In particular, we believe that this is the first solution that expresses the server-side functionality in a single SQL statement. In its basic form, SpaceTwist utilizes well-known incremental NN query processing on the server. When augmented with a server-side granular search technique, SpaceTwist is capable of exploiting relaxed query accuracy guarantees for obtaining better performance. We extend SpaceTwist with so-called ring ranking, which improves the communication cost, delayed termination, which improves the privacy afforded the user, and the ability to function in spatial networks in addition to Euclidean space. We report on analytical and empirical studies that offer insight into the properties of SpaceTwist and suggest that our proposal is indeed capable of offering privacy with very good performance in realistic settings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14536","fieldValue":"Tan, Wang-Chiew"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14536","fieldValue":" An inverse of a schema mapping M is intended to undo what M does, thus providing a way to perform reverse data exchange. In recent years, three different formalizations of this concept have been introduced and studied, namely the notions of an inverse of a schema mapping, a quasi-inverse of a schema mapping, and a maximum recovery of a schema mapping. The study of these notions has been carried out in the context in which source instances are restricted to consist entirely of constants, while target instances may contain both constants and labeled nulls. This restriction on source instances is crucial for obtaining some of the main technical results about these three notions, but, at the same time, limits their usefulness, since reverse data exchange naturally leads to source instances that may contain both constants and labeled nulls. We develop a new framework for reverse data exchange that supports source instances that may contain nulls, and we thereby overcome the semantic mismatch between source and target instances of the previous formalizations. The development of this new framework requires a careful reformulation of all the important notions, including the notions of the identity schema mapping, inverse, and maximum recovery. To this effect, we introduce the notions of extended identity schema mapping, extended inverse, and maximum extended recovery, by making systematic use of the homomorphism relation on instances. We give results concerning the existence of extended inverses and of maximum extended recoveries, and results concerning their applications to reverse data exchange and query answering. Moreover, we show that maximum extended recoveries can be used to capture in a quantitative way, the amount of information loss embodied in a schema mapping specified by source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14536","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14536","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14537","fieldValue":" Skyline computation is widely used in multicriteria decision making. As research in uncertain databases draws increasing attention, skyline queries with uncertain data have also been studied. Some earlier work focused on probabilistic skylines with a given threshold; Atallah and Qi [2009] studied the problem to compute skyline probabilities for all instances of uncertain objects without the use of thresholds, and proposed an algorithm with subquadratic time complexity. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for computing all skyline probabilities that is asymptotically faster: worst-case O(n &sqrt;n log n) time and O(n) space for 2D data; $O(n^2âˆ\u20191\/d logdâˆ\u20191 n) time and O(n logdâˆ\u20192 n) space for d-dimensional data. Furthermore, we study the online version of the problem: Given any query point p (unknown until the query time), return the probability that no instance in the given data set dominates p. We propose an algorithm for answering such an online query for d-dimensional data in O(n1âˆ\u20191\/d logdâˆ\u20191 n) time after preprocessing the data in O(n2âˆ\u20191\/d logdâˆ\u20191$) time and space."}
