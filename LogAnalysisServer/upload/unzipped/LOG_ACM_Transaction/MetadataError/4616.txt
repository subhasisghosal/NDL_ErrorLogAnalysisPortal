We first describe the class of simulation optimization algorithms under consideration and discuss how the estimate of the optimal solution should be chosen when the feasible region of the underlying optimization problem is countably infinite. Then, we present a general result that guarantees the global convergence with probability one of the simulation optimization algorithms in this class. The assumptions of this result are sufficiently weak to allow the algorithms under consideration to be efficient, in that they are not required to either allocate the same amount of computer effort to all the feasible points these algorithms visit, or to spend an increasing amount of computer effort per iteration as the number of iterations grows. This article concludes with a discussion of how our assumptions can be satisfied and also generalized."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24931","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24931","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24932","fieldValue":" We develop a new approach to the validation of simulation models by exploiting elements from fuzzy set theory and machine learning. A fuzzy resemblance relation concept is used to set up a mathematical framework for measuring the degree of similarity between the input-output behavior of a simulation model and the corresponding behavior of the real system. A neuro-fuzzy inference algorithm is employed to automatically learn the required resemblance relation from real and simulated data. Ultimately, defuzzification strategies are applied to obtain a coefficient on the unit interval that characterizes the degree of model validity. An example in the airline industry illustrates the practical application of this methodology."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24932","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24932","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24933","fieldValue":" This article describes an algorithm for detecting the occurrence of events, which signify discontinuities in the first derivative of the state variables, while simulating a set of nonsmooth differential equations. Such combined-discrete continuous systems arise in many contexts and are often referred to as hybrid systems, switched systems, or nonsmooth systems. In all cases, the state events are triggered at simulated times which generate states corresponding to the zeros of some algebraic â\u20ACœeventâ\u20AC? function. It has been noted that all existing simulators are prone to failure when these events occur in the neighborhood of model singularities---regions of the state space where the right-hand side of the differential equation is undefined. Such model singularities are often the impetus for using nonsmooth models in the first place. This failure occurs because existing algorithms blindly attempt to interpolate across singular regions, checking for possible events after the fact. The event detection algorithm described here overcomes this limitation using an approach inspired by feedback control theory. A carefully constructed extrapolation polynomial is used to select the integration step size by checking for potential future events, avoiding the need to evaluate the differential equation in potentially singular regions. It is shown that this alternate approach gives added functionality with little impact on the simulation efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24933","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24933","fieldValue":"ACM"}
