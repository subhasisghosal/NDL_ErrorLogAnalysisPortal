In this paper, we model this interconnect as a unified input interconnect block (IIB). We identify three types of IIBs and develop general combinatorial techniques to count the number of distinct functional configurations for them. We use entropy, defined as the logarithm of this count, to estimate an IIB's routing flexibility. This enables us to analytically evaluate different IIBs without the customary time-consuming place and route experiments. We show that both depopulated 1-level IIBs and VPR-style 2-level IIBs achieve high routing flexibility but lack area efficiency. We propose a novel class of highly efficient, yet still simple, IIBs that use substantially fewer switches with only a small degradation in routing flexibility. Experimental results verify the routability of these IIBs, and confirm that entropy is a good predictor of routability."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21692","fieldValue":"LUT"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21692","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21692","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21693","fieldValue":"Wilton, Steven JE"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21693","fieldValue":"Leong, Philip HW"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21693","fieldValue":" We present an architecture for a synthesizable datapath-oriented FPGA core that can be used to provide post-fabrication flexibility to an SoC. Our architecture is optimized for bus-based operations and employs a directional routing architecture, which allows it to be synthesized using standard ASIC design tools and flows. The primary motivation for this architecture is to provide an efficient mechanism to support on-chip debugging. The fabric can also be used to implement other datapath-oriented circuits such as those needed in signal processing and computation-intensive applications. We evaluate our architecture using a set of benchmark circuits and compare it to previous fabrics in terms of area, speed, and power."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21693","fieldValue":"ACM"}
