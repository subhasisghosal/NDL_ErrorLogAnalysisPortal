It can be reduced through Low-Power Listening (LPL) techniques in which a node is allowed to sleep for a significant amount of time. In contrast to conventional fixed sleep time policies, we introduce a novel dynamic sleep time control approach that further reduces control packet energy waste by utilizing known data traffic statistics. We propose two distinct approaches to dynamically compute the sleep time, depending on the objectives and constraints of the network. The first approach provides a dynamic sleep time policy that guarantees a specified average delay at the sender node resulting from packets waiting for the end of a sleep interval at the receiver. The second approach determines the optimal policy that minimizes total energy consumed. In the case where data traffic statistics are unknown, we propose an adaptive learning algorithm to estimate them online and develop corresponding sleep time computation algorithms. Simulation results are included to illustrate the use of dynamic sleep time control and to demonstrate how it dominates fixed sleep time methods. An implementation of our approach on a commercial sensor node supports the computational feasibility of the proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21310","fieldValue":" A low sampling rate leads to reduced congestion and hence energy consumption in the resource-constrained wireless sensor networks. In this article, we propose asynchronous sampling that shifts the sampling time instances of sensor nodes from each other. For lossy data gathering scenarios, the proposed approach provides more information about the physical phenomena in terms of increased entropy at a low sampling rate. For lossless data gathering scenarios, on the other hand, the sampling rate is lowered without sacrificing critical knowledge required for signal reconstruction. As lower sampling rates lead to smaller energy consumption for processing and transmitting the collected sensory data, the proposed asynchronous sampling strategies are capable of achieving a better trade-off between the lifetime of the network and the quality of collected information. In addition to mathematical analysis, simulation results based on real data also verify the benefits of our asynchronous sampling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21310","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21310","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21311","fieldValue":" Various sensor network measurement studies have reported instances of transient faults in sensor readings. In this work, we seek to answer a simple question: How often are such faults observed in real deployments&quest; We focus on three types of transient faults, caused by faulty sensor readings that appear abnormal. To understand the prevalence of such faults, we first explore and characterize four qualitatively different classes of fault detection methods. Rule-based methods leverage domain knowledge to develop heuristic rules for detecting and identifying faults. Estimation methods predict â\u20ACœnormalâ\u20AC? sensor behavior by leveraging sensor correlations, flagging anomalous sensor readings as faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods start with an a priori model for sensor readings. A sensor measurement is compared against its predicted value computed using time series forecasting to determine if it is faulty. Learning-based methods infer a model for the â\u20ACœnormalâ\u20AC? sensor readings using training data, and then statistically detect and identify classes of faults. We find that these four classes of methods sit at different points on the accuracy\/robustness spectrum. Rule-based methods can be highly accurate, but their accuracy depends critically on the choice of parameters. Learning methods can be cumbersome to train, but can accurately detect and classify faults. Estimation methods are accurate, but cannot classify faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods are more effective for detecting short duration faults than long duration ones, and incur more false positives than the other methods. We apply these techniques to four real-world sensor datasets and find that the prevalence of faults as well as their type varies with datasets. All four methods are qualitatively consistent in identifying sensor faults, lending credence to our observations. Our work is a first step towards automated online fault detection and classification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21311","fieldValue":"ACM"}
