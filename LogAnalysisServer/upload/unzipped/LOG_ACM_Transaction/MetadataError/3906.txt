A mobile system is one where independently executing components may migrate through some space during the course of the computation, and where the pattern of connectivity among the components changes as they move in and out of proximity. Mobile UNITY is a notation and proof logic for specifying and reasoning about mobile systems. In this article it is argued that Mobile UNITY contributes to the modular development of system specifications because of the declarative fashion in which coordination among components is specified. The packet-fowarding mechanism at the core of the Mobile IP protocol for routing to mobile hosts is taken as an example. A Mobile UNITY model of packet forwarding and the mobile system in which it must operate is developed. Proofs of correctness properties, including important real-time properties, are outlined, and the role of formal verification in the development of protocols such as Mobile IP is discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22637","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22637","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22638","fieldValue":" To a great extent, the usefulness of a formal model of a software process lies in its ability to accurately predict the behavior of the executing process. Similarly, the usefulness of an executing process lies largely in its ability to fulfill the requirements embodied in a formal model of the process. When process models and process executions diverge, something significant is happening. We have developed techniques for uncovering and measuring the discrepancies between models and executions, which we call process validation. Process validation takes a process execution and a process model, and measures the level of correspondence between the two. Our metrics are tailorable and give process engineers control over determining the severity of different types of discrepancies. The techniques provide detailed information once a high-level measurement indicates the presence of a problem. We have applied our processes validation methods in an industrial case study, of which a portion is described in this article."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22638","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22638","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3208","fieldValue":" The present aim was to study a new technique for human--computer interaction. It combined the use of two modalities, voluntary gaze direction and voluntary facial muscle activation for object pointing and selection. Fourteen subjects performed a series of pointing tasks with the new technique and with a mouse. At short distances the mouse was significantly faster than the new technique. However, there were no statistically significant differences at medium and long distances between the techniques. Fitts' law analyses were performed both by using only error-free trials and using also data including error trials (i.e., effective target width). In all cases both techniques seemed to follow Fitts' law, although for the new technique the effective target width correlation coefficient was smaller R = 0.776 than for the mouse R = 0.991. The regression slopes suggested that at very long distances (i.e., beyond 800 pixels) the new technique might be faster than the mouse. The new technique showed promising results already after a short practice and in the future it could be useful especially for physically challenged persons."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3208","fieldValue":"ACM"}
