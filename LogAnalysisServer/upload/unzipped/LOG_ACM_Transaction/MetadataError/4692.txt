The first goal of this work is to review a Recursive Variance Reduction (RVR) estimator, which approaches the unreliability by recursively reducing the graph from the random choice of the first working link on selected cuts. We show that the method does not verify the bounded relative error (BRE) property as reliability of individual links goes to oneâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, that the estimator is not robust in general to high reliability of links. We then propose to use the decomposition ideas of the RVR estimator in conjunction with the importance sampling technique. Two new estimators are presented: the first oneâ\u20AC\u201Dthe Balanced Recursive Decomposition estimatorâ\u20AC\u201Dchooses the first working link on cuts uniformly, whereas the secondâ\u20AC\u201Dthe Zero-Variance Approximation Recursive Decomposition estimatorâ\u20AC\u201Dtries to mimic the estimator with variance zero for this technique. We show that in both cases the BRE property is verified and, moreover, that a vanishing relative error (VRE) property can be obtained for the Zero-Variance Approximation RVR under specific sufficient conditions. A numerical illustration of the power of the methods is provided on several benchmark networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25115","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25115","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25116","fieldValue":" We discuss how to generalize the classic cross-entropy method in the case where a family of mixture distributions, such as the mixture of multiple Gaussian modes, is used as an importance sampling distribution. A new iterative cross-entropy scheme, based on the idea of the EM method, is proposed to overcome the challenge of deciding the optimal weights for each mode in the mixture. Detailed studies of this new algorithm and its applications to the estimation of rainbow option prices are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25116","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25116","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3430","fieldValue":" Numerous studies report that people underestimate egocentric distances in Head-Mounted Display (HMD) virtual environments compared to real environments as measured by direct blind walking. Geometric minification, or rendering graphics with a larger field of view than the display's field of view, has been shown to eliminate this underestimation in a virtual hallway environment [Kuhl et al. 2006, 2009]. This study demonstrates that minification affects blind walking in a sparse classroom and does not influence verbal reports of distance. Since verbal reports of distance have been reported to be compressed in real environments, we speculate that minification in an HMD replicates peoples' real-world blind walking and verbal report distance judgments. We also demonstrate a new method for quantifying any unintentional miscalibration in our experiments. This process involves using the HMD in an augmented reality configuration and having each participant indicate where the targets and horizon appeared after each experiment. More work is necessary to understand how and why minification changes verbal- and walking-based egocentric distance judgments differently."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3430","fieldValue":"Minification affects verbal- and action-based distance judgments differently in head-mounted displays"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3430","fieldValue":"ACM"}
