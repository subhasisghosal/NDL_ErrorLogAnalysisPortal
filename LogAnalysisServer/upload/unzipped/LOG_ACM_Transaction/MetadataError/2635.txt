{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18844","fieldValue":" We describe the design, implementation, and performance of a frontal code for the solution of large, sparse, unsymmetric systems of linear equations. The resulting software package, MA42, is included in Release 11 of the Harwell Subroutine Library and is intended to supersede the earlier MA32 package. We discuss in detail the extensive use of higher-level BLAS kernels within MA42 and illustrate the performance on a range of practical problems on a CRAY Y-MP, an IBM 3090, and an IBM RISC System\/6000. We examine extending the frontal solution scheme to use multiple fronts to allow MA42 to be run in parallel. We indicate some directions for future development."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18844","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18844","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2824","fieldValue":"Wong, Kam-Fai"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2824","fieldValue":" Conventional information extraction systems cannot effectively mine temporal information. For example, users' queries on how one event is related to another in time could not be handled effectively. For this reason, it is important to capture and deduce temporal knowledge associated with the relevant events. It is generally acknowledged that information extraction cannot be isolated from natural language processing. As Chinese has no tenses, conventional means for finding temporal references based on verb forms no longer apply. In this article we present an approach for formulating and discovering temporal relations in Chinese. A set of rules is devised to map the combinational effects of the temporal indicators (also known as temporal markers, gathered from various grammatical categories) in a sentence to its corresponding temporal relation. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, experiments were conducted using a set of news reports and the results look promising. Problem discussions are also provided. Through this work, we hope to open up new doors for future research in Chinese temporal information extraction and processing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2824","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2824","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18845","fieldValue":" The quasi-minimal residual (QMR) algorithm is a Krylov-subspace method for the iterative solution of large non-Hermitian linear systems. QMR is based on the look-ahead Lanczos algorithm that, by itself, can also be used to obtain approximate eigenvalues of large non-Hermitian matrices. QMRPACK is a software package with Fortran 77 implementations of the QMR algorithm and variants thereof, and of the three-term and coupled two-term look-ahead Lanczos algorithms. In this article, we discuss some of the features of the algorithms in the package, with emphasis on the issues related to using the codes. We describe in some detail two routines from the package, one for the solution of linear systems and the other for the computation of eigenvalue approximations. We present some numerical examples from applications where QMRPACK was used."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18845","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18845","fieldValue":"ACM"}
