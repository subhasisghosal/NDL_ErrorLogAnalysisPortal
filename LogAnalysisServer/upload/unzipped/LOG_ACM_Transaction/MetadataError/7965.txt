First, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for the throughput-maximizing scheduling problem. We then elaborate on certain special cases of this problem and explore their combinatorial properties. Second, we prove that the max-min fair scheduling problem is NP-Hard in the strong sense. We also prove that the problem cannot be approximated within any constant factor better than 2 unless P = NP. Additionally, we propose an approximation algorithm for the max-min fair scheduling problem with approximation ratio depending on the ratio of the maximum possible data rate to the minimum possible data rate of a secondary users. We then focus on the combinatorial properties of certain special cases and investigate their relation with various problems such as the multiple-knapsack, matching, terminal assignment, and Santa Claus problems. We then prove that the proportionally fair scheduling problem is NP-Hard in the strong sense and inapproximable within any additive constant less than log (4\/3). Finally, we evaluate the performance of our approximation algorithm for the max-min fair scheduling problem via simulations. This approach sheds light on the complexity and combinatorial properties of these scheduling problems, which have high practical importance in centralized cognitive radio networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10747","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8423","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10748","fieldValue":"Lau, Francis C M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10748","fieldValue":" Federation of geo-distributed cloud services is a trend in cloud computing that, by spanning multiple data centers at different geographical locations, can provide a cloud platform with much larger capacities. Such a geo-distributed cloud is ideal for supporting large-scale social media applications with dynamic contents and demands. Although promising, its realization presents challenges on how to efficiently store and migrate contents among different cloud sites and how to distribute user requests to the appropriate sites for timely responses at modest costs. These challenges escalate when we consider the persistently increasing contents and volatile user behaviors in a social media application. By exploiting social influences among users, this paper proposes efficient proactive algorithms for dynamic, optimal scaling of a social media application in a geo-distributed cloud. Our key contribution is an online content migration and request distribution algorithm with the following features: 1) future demand prediction by novelly characterizing social influences among the users in a simple but effective epidemic model; 2) one-shot optimal content migration and request distribution based on efficient optimization algorithms to address the predicted demand; and 3) a Î\u201D(t)-step look-ahead mechanism to adjust the one-shot optimization results toward the offline optimum. We verify the effectiveness of our online algorithm by solid theoretical analysis, as well as thorough comparisons to ready algorithms including the ideal offline optimum, using large-scale experiments with dynamic realistic settings on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10748","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10748","fieldValue":"ACM"}
