{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7894","fieldValue":" Behavioral targeting (BT) leverages historical user behavior to select the ads most relevant to users to display. The state-of-the-art of BT derives a linear Poisson regression model from fine-grained user behavioral data and predicts click-through rate (CTR) from user history. We designed and implemented a highly scalable and efficient solution to BT using Hadoop MapReduce framework. With our parallel algorithm and the resulting system, we can build above 450 BT-category models from the entire Yahooâ\u20AC™s user base within one day, the scale that one can not even imagine with prior systems. Moreover, our approach has yielded 20&percnt; CTR lift over the existing production system by leveraging the well-grounded probabilistic model fitted from a much larger training dataset. Specifically, our major contributions include: (1) A MapReduce statistical learning algorithm and implementation that achieve optimal data parallelism, task parallelism, and load balance in spite of the typically skewed distribution of domain data. (2) An in-place feature vector generation algorithm with strict linear-time complexity O(n) regardless of the granularity of sliding target window. (3) An in-memory caching scheme that significantly reduces the number of disk IOs to make large-scale learning practical. (4) Highly efficient data structures and sparse representations of models and data to enable fast model updates. We believe that our work makes significant contributions to solving large-scale machine learning problems of industrial relevance in general. Finally, we report comprehensive experimental results, using industrial proprietary codebase and datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7894","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7894","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1713","fieldValue":" We provide an analysis of thread-management techniques that increase performance or reduce energy in multicore and Simultaneous Multithreaded (SMT) cores. Thread delaying reduces energy consumption by running the core containing the critical thread at maximum frequency while scaling down the frequency and voltage of the cores containing noncritical threads. In this article, we provide an insightful breakdown of thread delaying on a simulated multi-core microprocessor. Thread balancing improves overall performance by giving higher priority to the critical thread in the issue queue of an SMT core. We provide a detailed breakdown of performance results for thread-balancing, identifying performance benefits and limitations. For those benchmarks where a performance benefit is not possible, we introduce a novel thread-balancing mechanism on an SMT core that can reduce energy consumption. We have performed a detailed study on an Intel microprocessor simulator running parallel applications. Thread delaying can reduce energy consumption by 4&percnt; to 44&percnt; with negligible performance loss. Thread balancing can increase performance by 20&percnt; or can reduce energy consumption by 23&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1713","fieldValue":"Thread-management techniques to maximize efficiency in multicore and simultaneous multithreaded microprocessors"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1713","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1713","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7895","fieldValue":"Fung, Benjamin C M"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7895","fieldValue":"Hung, Patrick C K"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7895","fieldValue":"Lee, Cheuk-Kwong"}
