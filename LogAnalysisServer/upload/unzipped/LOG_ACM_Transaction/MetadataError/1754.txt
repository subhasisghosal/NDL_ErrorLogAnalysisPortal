{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16224","fieldValue":" We present an optimization framework for exploring gradient-domain solutions for image and video processing. The proposed framework unifies many of the key ideas in the gradient-domain literature under a single optimization formulation. Our hope is that this generalized framework will allow the reader to quickly gain a general understanding of the field and contribute new ideas of their own. We propose a novel metric for measuring local gradient saliency that identifies salient gradients that give rise to long, coherent edges, even when the individual gradients are faint. We present a general weighting scheme for gradient constraints that improves the visual appearance of results. We also provide a solution for applying gradient-domain filters to videos and video streams in a coherent manner. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our formulation in creating effective yet simple to implement solutions for various image-processing tasks. To exercise our formulation we have created a new saliency-based sharpen filter and a pseudo image-relighting application. We also revisit and improve upon previously defined filters such as nonphotorealistic rendering, image deblocking, and sparse data interpolation over images (e.g., colorization using optimization)."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16224","fieldValue":"NPR"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16224","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16224","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16225","fieldValue":"Feng, Wei-Wen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16225","fieldValue":"Kim, Byung-Uck"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16225","fieldValue":" Geometry images resample meshes to represent them as texture for efficient GPU processing by forcing a regular parameterization that often incurs a large amount of distortion. Previous approaches broke the geometry image into multiple rectangular or irregular charts to reduce distortion, but complicated the automatic level of detail one gets from MIP-maps of the geometry image. We introduce triangular-chart geometry images and show this new approach better supports the GPU-side representation and display of skinned dynamic meshes, with support for feature preservation, bounding volumes, and view-dependent level of detail. Triangular charts pack efficiently, simplify the elimination of T-junctions, arise naturally from an edge-collapse simplification base mesh, and layout more flexibly to allow their edges to follow curvilinear mesh features. To support the construction and application of triangular-chart geometry images, this article introduces a new spectral clustering method for feature detection, and new methods for incorporating skinning weights and skinned bounding boxes into the representation. This results in a tenfold improvement in fidelity when compared to quad-chart geometry images."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16225","fieldValue":"Feature-preserving triangular geometry images for level-of-detail representation of static and skinned meshes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16225","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16225","fieldValue":"ACM"}
