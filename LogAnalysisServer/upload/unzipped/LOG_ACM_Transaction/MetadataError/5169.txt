To reduce the number of adaptive parameters, it has been proposed to model the acoustic feedback paths as the convolution of a time-invariant common pole-zero filter and time-varying all-zero filters, enabling to track fast changes. In this paper, a novel procedure to estimate the common pole-zero filter of acoustic feedback paths is presented. In contrast to previous approaches which minimize the so-called equation-error, we propose to approximate the desired output-error minimization by employing a weighted least-squares procedure motivated by the Steiglitz--McBride iteration. The estimation of the common pole-zero filter is formulated as a semidefinite programming problem, to which a constraint based on the Lyapunov theory is added in order to guarantee the stability of the estimated pole-zero filter. Experimental results using measured acoustic feedback paths from a two microphone behind-the-ear hearing aid show that the proposed optimization procedure using the Lyapunov constraint outperforms existing optimization procedures in terms of modelling accuracy and added stable gain."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4064","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4064","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4064","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4065","fieldValue":" We introduce a new and intuitive algorithm to characterize and localize multiple harmonic sources intersecting in the spatial and frequency domains. It jointly estimates their fundamental frequencies, their respective amplitudes, and their directions of arrival based on an intelligent non-parametric signal representation. To obtain these parameters, we first apply variable-scale sampling on unbiased cross-correlation functions between pairs of microphone signals to generate a joint parameter space. Then, we employ a multidimensional maxima detector to represent the parameters in a sparse joint parameter space. In comparison to others, our algorithm solves the issue of pitch-period doubling when using cross-correlation functions, it estimates multiple harmonic sources with a signal power smaller than the signal power of the dominant harmonic source, and it associates the estimated parameters to their corresponding sources in a multidimensional sparse joint parameter space, which can be directly fed into a tracker. We tested our algorithm and three others on synthetic data and speech data recorded in a real reverberant environment and evaluated their performance by employing the joint recall measure, the root-mean-square error, and the cumulative distribution function of fundamental frequencies and directions of arrival. The evaluations show promising results: Our algorithm outperforms the others in terms of the joint recall measure, and it can achieve root-mean-square errors of 1 Hz or 1Â° and smaller, which facilitates, e.g., distant-speech enhancement or source separation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4065","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4065","fieldValue":"ACM"}
