{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19414","fieldValue":" The Fortran95 code VTDIRECT95, based on the original MPI, has been modified to use MPI-2. An option for VTDIRECT95 is to divide the feasible box into subdomains, and concurrently apply the global direct search algorithm DIRECT within each subdomain. When the number of subdomains is greater than one, a bug causes VTDIRECT95 to occasionally sample outside the given feasible box, which is serious if the objective function is not defined outside the given box. This bug has been fixed, and the sample output files have been updated to reflect the correction. For completeness, the package VTDIRECT95 now contains both the MPI-1 (with the multiple subdomain bug fixed) and the MPI-2 versions of the code."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19414","fieldValue":"DIRECT"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19414","fieldValue":"Remark on Algorithm 897: VTDIRECT95: Serial and Parallel Codes for the Global Optimization Algorithm DIRECT"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19414","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19414","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19415","fieldValue":"Boissonnat, Jean-Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19415","fieldValue":" CGALmesh is the mesh generation software package of the Computational Geometry Algorithm Library (CGAL). It generates isotropic simplicial meshesâ\u20AC\u201Dsurface triangular meshes or volume tetrahedral meshesâ\u20AC\u201Dfrom input surfaces, 3D domains, and 3D multidomains, with or without sharp features. The underlying meshing algorithm relies on restricted Delaunay triangulations to approximate domains and surfaces and on Delaunay refinement to ensure both approximation accuracy and mesh quality. CGALmesh provides guarantees on approximation quality and on the size and shape of the mesh elements. It provides four optional mesh optimization algorithms to further improve the mesh quality. A distinctive property of CGALmesh is its high flexibility with respect to the input domain representation. Such a flexibility is achieved through a careful software design, gathering into a single abstract concept, denoted by the oracle, all required interface features between the meshing engine and the input domain. We already provide oracles for domains defined by polyhedral and implicit surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2878","fieldValue":"Revisiting Document Length Hypotheses: A Comparative Study of Japanese Newspaper and Patent Retrieval"}
