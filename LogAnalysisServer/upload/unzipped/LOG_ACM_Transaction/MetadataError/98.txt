{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11235","fieldValue":" Problem-Based Learning (PBL) has often been seen as an all-or-nothing approach, difficult to apply in traditional curricula based on traditional lectured courses with exercise and lab sessions. Aalborg University has since its creation in 1974 practiced PBL in all subjects, including computer science and software engineering, following a model that has become known as the Aalborg Model. Following a strategic decision in 2009, the Aalborg Model has been reshaped. We first report on the software engineering program as it was in the old Aalborg Model. We analyze the programme wrt competence levels according to Bloomâ\u20AC™s taxonomy and compare it with the expected skills and competencies for an engineer passing a general software engineering 4-year program with an additional 4 years of experience as defined in the IEEE Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) [Abran et al. 2004]. We also compare with the Graduate Software Engineering 2009 Curriculum Guidelines for Graduate Degree Programmes in Software Engineering (GSwE2009) [Pyster 2009]. We then describe the new curriculum and draw some preliminary conclusions based on analyzing the curriculum according to Bloomâ\u20AC™s taxonomy and the results of running the program for 2 years. As the new program is structured to be compliant with the Bologna Process and thus presents all activities in multipla of 5 European Credit Transfer System points, we envision that elements of the program could be used in more traditional curricula. This should be especially easy for programs also complying with the Bologna Process."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11235","fieldValue":"Assessing Problem-Based Learning in a Software Engineering Curriculum Using Bloomâ\u20AC™s Taxonomy and the IEEE Software Engineering Body of Knowledge"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11235","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11235","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11236","fieldValue":" We know from research that there is an intimate relationship between student learning and the context of learning. What is not known or understood well enough is the relationship of the studentsâ\u20AC™ background and previous studies to the understanding and learning of the subject areaâ\u20AC\u201Dhere, computer science (CS). To show the contextual influences on learning CS, we present empirical data from a qualitative investigation of the experiences of Chinese students studying for a master degree at Sweden's Uppsala University. Data were collected of the studentsâ\u20AC™ understanding and learning of CS, their experience of the teaching and their own studies, and of their personal development in Sweden. Using an analysis framework grounded in phenomenography, we analytically separated the what and how aspects of learning. In this article, we describe the what, or the content of the studentsâ\u20AC™ learning, and identify dimensions of variation in the experiences of students. These dimensions relate to the foci of the CS programs, the learning outcomes, and the impact of the studies. The findings from the analyses indicate pedagogical and pragmatic implications for teaching and learning CS in higher education institutions. The study extends the traditional use of phenomenography through the discussion of the dimensions of variation in the experiences and the values within the dimensions. It opens the way for understanding the relational nature of learning in computing education."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11236","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11236","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11237","fieldValue":" The term gender gap refers to the significant underrepresentation of females in many subjects. In Computer Science, the gender gap exists at all career levels. In this article, we study whether there is a performance gap in addition to the gender gap. To answer this question, we analyzed statistical data on student performance in Computer Science from 129 universities in the United Kingdom covering the years 2002 to 2013. We find that male students were awarded significantly more first-class degrees than female students. We evaluate four other subjectsâ\u20AC\u201DSubjects Allied to Medicine, Business & Administrative Studies, Mathematical Sciences, and Engineering & Technologyâ\u20AC\u201D& Technologyâ\u20AC\u201Dâ\u20AC\u201Dand find that they do not exhibit this performance gap. From this finding, we review explanations for the gender and performance gaps, as well as potential solutions to eliminate the gaps. Most solutions do not require major institutional change and could thus be implemented easily."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11237","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11237","fieldValue":"ACM"}
