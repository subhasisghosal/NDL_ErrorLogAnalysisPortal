A high-quality estimation of high-order surface derivatives is achieved by combining multi-level implicit surface fitting and finite difference approximations. We demonstrate that the ridges and valleys are geometrically and perceptually salient surface features, and, therefore, can be potentially used for shape recognition, coding, and quality evaluation purposes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15439","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15439","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15440","fieldValue":" Morse theory reveals the topological structure of a shape based on the critical points of a real function over the shape. A poor choice of this real function can lead to a complex configuration of an unnecessarily high number of critical points. This paper solves a relaxed form of Laplace's equation to find a \"fair\" Morse function with a user-controlled number and configuration of critical points. When the number is minimal, the resulting Morse complex cuts the shape into a disk. Specifying additional critical points at surface features yields a base domain that better represents the geometry and shares the same topology as the original mesh, and can also cluster a mesh into approximately developable patches. We make Morse theory on meshes more robust with teflon saddles and flat edge collapses, and devise a new \"intermediate value propagation\" multigrid solver for finding fair Morse functions that runs in provably linear time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15440","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15440","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15441","fieldValue":" With recent improvements in methods for the acquisition and rendering of 3D models, the need for retrieval of models has gained prominence in the graphics and vision communities. A variety of methods have been proposed that enable the efficient querying of model repositories for a desired 3D shape. Many of these methods use a 3D model as a query and attempt to retrieve models from the database that have a similar shape.In this paper we consider the implications of anisotropy on the shape matching paradigm. In particular, we propose a novel method for matching 3D models that factors the shape matching equation as the disjoint outer product of anisotropy and geometric comparisons. We provide a general method for computing the factored similarity metric and show how this approach can be applied to improve the matching performance of many existing shape matching methods."}
