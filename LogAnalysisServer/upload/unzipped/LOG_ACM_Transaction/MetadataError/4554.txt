{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24775","fieldValue":" In Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), each participating node is responsible for maintaining its own model of the synthetic environment. Problems may arise if significant inconsistencies are allowed to exist between these separate world views, resulting in unrealistic simulation results or negative training, and a corresponding degradation of interoperability in a DIS simulation exercise. In the DIS community, this is known as the simulator terrain database (TDB) correlation problem. This is part of the larger synthetic environment correlation problem in DIS, which includes atmosphere, ocean, space, and a wide variety of dynamic effects, behaviors and models. In this article, we investigate the terrain database correlation problem and the resultant effects on interoperability in DIS systems. The fundamental elements of terrain databases designed for real-time distributed simulation are introduced. A generic data pipeline for terrain database generation systems is developed for the purpose of illustrating causes of the correlation problem and issues of terrain database fidelity. Implications of the problem are discussed, and testing methodologies are recommended for its mitigation. Several statistical methods have been developed to analyze consistency between various elements of the synthetic environment across DIS platforms. Correlation metrics have been formulated for terrain elevations and features. Comparisons and consistency of final rendered images have been addressed. Finally, a suite of software tools that has been developed for interoperability investigations and visual comparison of terrain databases is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24776","fieldValue":" Simulations that run at multiple levels of resolution often encounter consistency problems because of insufficient correlation between the attributes at multiple levels of the same entity. Inconsistency may occur despite the existence of valid models at each resolution level. Cross-Resolution Modeling (CRM) attempts to build effective multiresolution simulations. The traditional approach to CRMâ\u20AC\u201Daggregation-disaggregationâ\u20AC\u201Dcauses chain disaggregation and puts an unacceptable burden on resources. We present four fundamental observations that would help guide future approaches to CRM. These observations form the basis of an approach we propose that involves the design of Multiple Resolution Entities (MREs). MREs are the foundation of a design that incorporates maintaining internal consistency. We also propose maintenance of core attributes as an approach to maintaining internal consistency within an MRE.."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24777","fieldValue":" The techniques and methodologies for verification and validation of software-based systems have arguably realized their greatest utility within the context of simulation. Advanced Distributed Simulation (ADS), a major initiative within the defense modeling and simulation community, presents a variety of challenges to the classical approaches. A case study of the development process and concomitant verification and validation activities for the Joint Training Confederation (JTC) is presented. The JTC is one of the largest current ADS efforts, and the primary application of the Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol. A dichotomy between classical verification and validation approaches and the requirements of a prototypical ADS environment is illustrated. Mechanisms and research directions to resolve these differences are briefly discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24777","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24777","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1254","fieldValue":" Heterogeneities (heterogeneous characteristics) are intrinsic in dynamic and autonomous networks, and may be caused by the following factors: finite nodes, structured network graph, mutation of node's strategy and topological view, and dynamic linking, and so on. However, few works systematically investigate the effect of the intrinsic heterogeneities on the evolutionary dynamics of incentive mechanisms in autonomous networks. In this article, we thoroughly discuss this interesting problem. Specifically, this article respectively models the pairwise interaction between peers as PD (prisoner's dilemma)-like game and multiple peers' interactions as public-goods game, proposes a general analytical framework for dynamics in evolutionary game theory (EGT)-based incentive mechanisms, and draws the following conclusions. First, for explicit incentive mechanisms, due to heterogeneity, it is impossible to get the static equilibrium of absolutely-full-cooperation (or state that provides service to the networksâ\u20AC\u201Dso-called reciprocation), but, on the other hand, heterogeneity can facilitate reciprocation evolution, and drive the whole system into almost-full-reciprocation state, that is, most of the system time would be occupied by the full reciprocation state. Second, even without any explicit incentive mechanisms, simultaneous coevolution between dynamic linking and peers' rational strategies can not only facilitate the cooperation evolution, but drive the network structure into the desirable small-world structure. The philosophical implication of our work is that simplicity and homogeneity are too idealized for incentive mechanisms in autonomous networksâ\u20AC\u201Ddiversity and heterogeneity are intrinsic for any incentive mechanism that is compatible with the essence of our real society. Diversity is everywhere."}
