However, limited write endurance is a common problem for NVM technologies, and today's cache management might result in unbalanced cache write traffic, causing heavily written cache blocks to fail much earlier than others. Although wear-leveling techniques for NVM-based main memories exist, we cannot simply apply them to NVM-based caches. This is because cache writes have intraset variations as well as interset variations, while writes to main memories only have interset variations. To solve this problem, we propose $i^2WAP, a new cache management policy that can reduce both inter- and intraset write variations. i2WAP has two features: Swap-Shift, an enhancement based on existing main memory wear leveling to reduce cache interset write variations, and Probabilistic Set Line Flush, a novel technique to reduce cache intraset write variations. Implementing i2WAP only needs two global counters and two global registers. In one of our studies, i2WAP can improve the NVM cache lifetime by 75&percnt; on average and up to 224&percnt;. We also validate that i2$WAP is effective in systems with different cache configurations and workloads."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1910","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1910","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10026","fieldValue":"Hubaux, Jean-Pierre"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10026","fieldValue":" The longevity of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a major issue that impacts the application of such networks. While communication protocols are striving to save energy by acting on sensor nodes, recent results show that network lifetime can be prolonged by further involving sink mobility. As most proposals give their evidence of lifetime improvement through either (small-scale) field tests or numerical simulations on rather arbitrary cases, a theoretical understanding of the reason for this improvement and the tractability of the joint optimization problem is still missing. In this paper, we build a framework for investigating the joint sink mobility and routing problem by constraining the sink to a finite number of locations. We formally prove the NP-hardness of the problem. We also investigate the induced subproblems. In particular, we develop an efficient primal-dual algorithm to solve the subproblem involving a single sink, then we generalize this algorithm to approximate the original problem involving multiple sinks. Finally, we apply the algorithm to a set of typical topological graphs; the results demonstrate the benefit of involving sink mobility, and they also suggest the desirable moving traces of a sink."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10026","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10026","fieldValue":"Joint sink mobility and routing to maximize the lifetime of wireless sensor networks: the case of constrained mobility"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10026","fieldValue":"ACM"}
