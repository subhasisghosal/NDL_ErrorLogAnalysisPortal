{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12675","fieldValue":" Low power has emerged as a principal theme in today's electronics industry. The need for low power has caused a major paradigm shift in which power dissipation is as important as performance and area. This article presents an in-depth survey of CAD methodologies and techniques for designing low power digital CMOS circuits and systems and describes the many issues facing designers at architectural, logical, and physical levels of design abstraction. It reviews some of the techniques and tools that have been proposed to overcome these difficulties and outlines the future challenges that must be met to design low power, high performance systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12675","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12675","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12676","fieldValue":"Cheng, Kwang-Ting"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12676","fieldValue":" We present a method of automatic generation of functional vectors for sequential circuits. These vectors can be used for design verification, manufacturing testing, or power estimation. A high-level description of the circuit in VHDL or C is assumed available. Our method automatically transforms the high-level description of a circuit in VHDL or C into an extended finite state machine (EFSM) model that is used to generate functional vectors. The EFSM model is a generalization of the traditional state machine model. It is a compact representation of models with local data variables and preserves many nice properties of a traditional state machine model. The theoretical background of the EFSM model is addressed in this article. Our method guarantees that the generated vectors cover every statement in the high-level description at least once. Experimental results show that a set of comprehensive functional vectors for sequential circuits with more than a hundred flip-flops can be generated automatically in a few minutes of CPU time using our prototype system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12677","fieldValue":"Chang, Yao-Wen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12677","fieldValue":" A switch module M with W terminals on each side is said to be universal if every set of nets satisfying the dimensional constraint (i.e., the number of nets on each side of M is at most W) is simultaneously rout able through M. In this article, we present a class of universal switch modules. Each of our switch modules has 6Wswitches and switch-module flexibility three (i.e, Fs=3). We prove that no switch module with less than 6W switches can be universal. We also compare our switch modules with those used in the Xilinx XC4000 family FPGAs and the antisymmetric switch modules (with FS=3) suggested by Rose and Brown [1991]. Although these two kinds of switch modules also have FS=3 and 6W switches, we show that they are not universal. Based on combinatorial counting techniques, we show that each of our universal switch modules can accommodate up to 25% more routing instances, compared with the XC4000-type switch module of the same size. Experimental results demonstrate that our universal switch modules improve routability at the chip level. Finally, our work also provides a theoretical insight into the important observation by Rose and Brown [1991] (based on extensive experiments) that FS=3 is often sufficient to provide high routability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12677","fieldValue":"ACM"}
