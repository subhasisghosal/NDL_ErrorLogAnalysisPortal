Unfortunately, ads placed in contexts where they are rarely viewedâ\u20AC\u201Dor where users are unlikely to be interested in commercial resultsâ\u20AC\u201Dmay receive few clicks regardless of their quality. In this article, we model the variability of a userâ\u20AC™s browsing behavior for the purpose of click analysis and prediction in sponsored search. Our model incorporates several important contextual factors that influence ad clickthrough rates, including the userâ\u20AC™s query and ad placement on search engine result pages. We formally model these factors with respect to the list of ads displayed on a result page, the probability that the user will initiate browsing of this list, and the persistence of the user in browsing the list. We incorporate these factors into existing click models by augmenting them with appropriate query and location biases. Using expectation maximization, we learn the parameters of these augmented models from click signals recorded in the logs of a commercial search engine. To evaluate the performance of the models and to compare them with state-of-the-art performance, we apply standard evaluation metrics, including log-likelihood and perplexity. Our evaluation results indicate that, through the incorporation of query and location biases, significant improvements can be achieved in predicting browsing and click behavior in sponsored search. In addition, we explore the extent to which these biases actually reflect varying behavioral patterns. Our observations confirm that correlations exist between the biases and user search behavior."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7574","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7574","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7575","fieldValue":" Clickthrough and conversation rates estimation are two core predictions tasks in display advertising.

Unlike traditional web ads, the advertiserâ\u20AC™s profits for group-buying ads depend on the time to expiry and additional customers needed to satisfy the minimum group size. Since both these quantities are time-dependent, optimal bid amounts to maximize profits change with every impression. Consequently, traditional static bidding strategies are far from optimal. Instead, bid values need to be optimized in real-time to maximize expected bidder profits. This online optimization of deal profits is made possible by the advent of ad exchanges offering real-time (spot) bidding. To this end, we propose a real-time bidding strategy for group-buying deals based on the online optimization of bid values. We derive the expected bidder profit of deals as a function of the bid amounts and dynamically vary the bids to maximize profits. Furthermore, to satisfy time constraints of the online bidding, we present methods of minimizing computation timings. Subsequently, we derive the real-time ad selection, admissibility, and real-time bidding of the traditional ads as the special cases of the proposed method. We evaluate the proposed bidding, selection, and admission strategies on a multimillion click stream of 935 ads. The proposed real-time bidding, selection, and admissibility show significant profit increases over the existing strategies. Further experiments illustrate the robustness of the bidding and acceptable computation timings."}
