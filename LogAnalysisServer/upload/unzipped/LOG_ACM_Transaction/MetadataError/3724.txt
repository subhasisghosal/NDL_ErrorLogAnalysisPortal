Several algorithms have been suggested in the past for solving them efficiently or with minimal errors. Meanwhile, a new wave on the technological frontier has brought about general-purpose computing on GPUs. In this article, we describe how accumulated cost surfaces can be solved with CUDA. To verify the performance of our solution, we performed an experimental comparison against implementations run on a CPU. Our results with realistic cost models indicate that the move to GPUs can engender a speed-up of an order of magnitude."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21977","fieldValue":"CUDA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21978","fieldValue":" This article presents a new algorithm called Snap Rounding with Restore (SRR), which aims to make geometric datasets robust and to increase the quality of geometric approximation and the preservation of topological structure. It is based on the well-known Snap Rounding algorithm but improves it by eliminating from the snap rounded arrangement the configurations in which the distance between a vertex and a nonincident edge is smaller than half the width of a pixel of the rounding grid. Therefore, the goal of SRR is exactly the same as the goal of another algorithm, Iterated Snap Rounding (ISR), and of its evolution, Iterated Snap Rounding with Bounded Drift (ISRBD). However, SRR produces an output with a quality of approximation that is on average better than ISRBD, under the viewpoint both of the distance from the original segments and of the conservation of their topological structure. The article also reports some cases where ISRBD, notwithstanding the bounded drift, produces strong topological modifications while SRR does not. A statistical analysis on a large collection of input datasets confirms these differences. It follows that the proposed Snap Rounding with Restore algorithm is suitable for applications that require robustness, a guaranteed geometric approximation, and a good topological approximation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21978","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21978","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21979","fieldValue":" In this article, we study automated simplification and schematization of territorial outlines. We present a quadratic-time simplification algorithm based on an operation called edge-move. We prove that the number of edges of any nonconvex simple polygon can be reduced with this operation. Moreover, edge-moves preserve area and topology and do not introduce new orientations. The latter property in particular makes the algorithm highly suitable for schematization in which all resulting lines are required to be parallel to one of a given set of lines (orientations). To obtain such a result, we need only to preprocess the input to use only lines that are parallel to one of the given set. We present an algorithm to enforce such orientation restrictions, again without changing area or topology. Experiments show that our algorithms obtain results of high visual quality."}
