Packets arrive at a router at integer time steps, and are buffered upon arrival. Packets have non-negative weights and integer deadlines that are (weakly) increasing in their arrival times. In each integer time step, at most one packet can be sent. The objective is to maximize the sum of the weights of the packets that are sent by their deadlines. The main results include an optimal (Ï\u2020 := (1 + âˆš 5)\/2 &ap; 1.618)-competitive deterministic online algorithm, a (4\/3 &ap; 1.33)-competitive randomized online algorithm against an oblivious adversary, and a 2-speed 1-competitive deterministic online algorithm. The analysis does not use a potential function explicitly, but instead modifies the adversary's buffer and credits the adversary to account for these modifications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2566","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2566","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16521","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16521","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a new structure-aware shape deformation technique. The key idea is to detect continuous and discrete regular patterns and ensure that these patterns are preserved during free-form deformation. We propose a variational deformation model that preserves these structures, and a discrete algorithm that adaptively inserts or removes repeated elements in regular patterns to minimize distortion. As a tool for such structural adaptation, we introduce sliding dockers, which represent repeatable elements that fit together seamlessly for arbitrary repetition counts. We demonstrate the presented approach on a number of complex 3D models from commercial shape libraries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16522","fieldValue":"Yang, Yong-Liang"}
