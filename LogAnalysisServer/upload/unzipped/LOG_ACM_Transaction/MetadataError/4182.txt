This paper examines the data management requirements of group work applications on the basis of experience with three prototype systems and on observations from the literature. Database and object management technologies that support these requirements are briefly surveyed, and unresolved issues in the particular areas of access control and concurrency control are identified for future research."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23610","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23610","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23611","fieldValue":"Chang, Shi-Huo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23611","fieldValue":" The design approach of a knowledge-based message management system is described. A linguistic message filter is used to filter out junk messages. Relevant messages are then processed by an expert system, driven by user-defined alerter rules. An alerter rule base for a secretarial office is illustrated. Further research topics in knowledge-base design, evaluation, and learning are also discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23611","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23611","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23612","fieldValue":" Signature files have attracted a lot of interest as an access method for text and specifically for messages in the office environment. Messages are stored sequentially in the message file, whereas their hash-coded abstractions (signatures) are stored sequentially in the signature file. To answer a query, the signature file is examined first, and many nonqualifying messages are immediately rejected. In this paper we examine the problem of designing signature extraction methods and studying their performance. We describe two old methods, generalize another one, and propose a new method and its variation. We provide exact and approximate formulas for the dependency between the false drop probability and the signature size for all the methods, and we show that the proposed method (VBC) achieves approximately ten times smaller false drop probability than the old methods, whereas it is well suited for collections of documents with variable document sizes."}
