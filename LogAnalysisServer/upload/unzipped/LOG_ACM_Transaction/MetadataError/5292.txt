In a cloud environment, a designer has to consider and evaluate different control points, that is, those variables that affect the quality of the software system. This article presents a methodology for designing adaptive systems in cloud environments. The proposed methodology consists of several phases that take high-level stakeholdersâ\u20AC™ adaptation goals and transform them into lower-level MAPE-K loop control points. The MAPE-K loops are then activated at runtime using search-based algorithms. Our methodology includes the elicitation, ranking, and evaluation of control points, all meant to enable a runtime search-based adaptation. We conducted several experiments to evaluate the different phases of our methodology and to validate the runtime adaptation efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1335","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1335","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4372","fieldValue":" A principal goal of microarray studies is to identify the genes showing differential expression under distinct conditions. In such studies, the selection of an optimal test statistic is a crucial challenge, which depends on the type and amount of data under analysis. While previous studies on simulated or spike-in datasets do not provide practical guidance on how to choose the best method for a given real dataset, we introduce an enhanced reproducibility-optimization procedure, which enables the selection of a suitable gene- anking statistic directly from the data. In comparison with existing ranking methods, the reproducibilityoptimized statistic shows good performance consistently under various simulated conditions and on Affymetrix spike-in dataset. Further, the feasibility of the novel statistic is confirmed in a practical research setting using data from an in-house cDNA microarray study of asthma-related gene expression changes. These results suggest that the procedure facilitates the selection of an appropriate test statistic for a given dataset without relying on a priori assumptions, which may bias the findings and their interpretation. Moreover, the general reproducibilityoptimization procedure is not limited to detecting differential expression only but could be extended to a wide range of other applications as well."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4372","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_MULTIPLE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4372","fieldValue":"Microarray, gene expression,  gene ranking, reproducibility, differential expression, bootstrap"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4372","fieldValue":"ACM"}
