As the user pulls parts of the shape, the rest of the mesh automatically changes in an intuitive way by drawing from a set of exemplars. This provides a way for virtual shapes or characters to be easily authored and manipulated, or for a set of drawings to be animated with simple inputs. We describe a new approach for example-based inverse kinematic mesh manipulation which generates high quality deformations for a wide range of inputs, and in particular works well even when provided stylized or \"cartoony\" examples. This approach is fast enough to run in real time, reliably uses the artist's input shapes in an intuitive way even for highly nonphysical deformations, and provides added expressiveness by allowing the input shapes to be utilized in a way which spatially varies smoothly across the resulting deformed mesh. This allows for rich and detailed deformations to be created from a small set of input shapes, and gives an easy way for a set of sketches to be brought alive with simple click-and-drag inputs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17733","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present an interactive system for mechanism modeling from multi-view images. Its key feature is that the generated 3D mechanism models contain not only geometric shapes but also internal motion structures: they can be directly animated through kinematic simulation. Our system consists of two steps: interactive 3D modeling and stochastic motion parameter estimation. At the 3D modeling step, our system is designed to integrate the sparse 3D points reconstructed from multi-view images and a sketching interface to achieve accurate 3D modeling of a mechanism. To recover the motion parameters, we record a video clip of the mechanism motion and adopt stochastic optimization to recover its motion parameters by edge matching. Experimental results show that our system can achieve the 3D modeling of a range of mechanisms from simple mechanical toys to complex mechanism objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17733","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17733","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17734","fieldValue":" We propose a framework for global registration of building scans. The first contribution of our work is to detect and use portals (e.g., doors and windows) to improve the local registration between two scans. Our second contribution is an optimization based on a linear integer programming formulation. We abstract each scan as a block and model the blocks registration as an optimization problem that aims at maximizing the overall matching score of the entire scene. We propose an efficient solution to this optimization problem by iteratively detecting and adding local constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on buildings of various styles and that our approach is superior to the current state of the art."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17734","fieldValue":"ACM"}
