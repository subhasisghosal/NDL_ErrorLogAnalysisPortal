These scenes are difficult to display because their contrasts greatly exceed the range of most display devices for images. As a result, the image constrasts are compressed or truncated, obscuring subtle textures and details. Humans view and understand high contrast scenes easily, â\u20ACœadaptingâ\u20AC? their visual response to avoid compression or truncation with no apparent loss of detail. By imitating some of these visual adaptation processes, we developed methods for the improved display of high-contrast images. The first builds a display image from several layers of lighting and surface properties. Only the lighting layers are compressed, drastically reducing contrast while preserving much of the image detail. This method is practical only for synthetic images where the layers can be retained from the rendering process. The second method interactively adjusts the displayed image to preserve local contrasts in a small â\u20ACœfovealâ\u20AC? neighborhood. Unlike the first method, this technique is usable on any image and includes a new tone reproduction operator. Both methods use a sigmoid function for contrast compression. This function has no effect when applied to small signals but compresses large signals to fit within an asymptotic limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches by comparing processed and unprocessed images."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15169","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15169","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15170","fieldValue":" User interfaces for color selection consist of a visible screen representation, an input method, and the underlying conceptual organization of the color model. We report a two-way factorial, between-subjects variable experiment that tested the effect of high and low visual feedback interfaces on speed and accuracy of color matching for RGB and HSV color models. The only significant effect was improved accuracy due to increased visual feedback. Using color groups as a within-subjects variable, we found differences in performance of both speed and accuracy. We recommend that experimental tests adopt a color test set that does not show bias toward a particular model, but is based instead on a range of colors that would be most likely matched in practice by people using color selection software. We recomment the Macbeth Color Checker naturals, primaries, and grays. As a follow-up study, a qualitative case analysis of the way users navigated through the color space indicates that feedback helps users with limited knowledge of the model, allowing them to refine their match to a higher degree of accuracy. Users with very little or a lot of knowledge of the color model do not appear to be aided by increased feedback. In conclusion, we suggest that visual feedback and design of the interface may be a more important factor in improving the usability of a color selection interface than the particular color model used."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15170","fieldValue":"HSV"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15170","fieldValue":"RGB"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15170","fieldValue":"Model and representation: the effect of visual feedback on human performance in a color picker interface"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15170","fieldValue":"ACM"}
