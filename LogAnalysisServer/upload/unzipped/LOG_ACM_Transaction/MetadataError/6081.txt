Information retrieval tasks are used to test the performance of these factors. First, a study is introduced that examines the effect that fluid intelligence and Internet usage has on individuals. Second, a larger study is reported on that examines a collection of Internet and cognitive factors in order to determine to what extent each of these metrics can account for disorientation in users. This work adds to growing evidence showing that age is not a suitable metric to distinguish between individuals within the field of human-computer interaction. It shows that factors such as previous Internet experience and fluid-based cognitive abilities can be used to gain better insight into usersâ\u20AC™ reported browsing experience during information retrieval tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1518","fieldValue":"HCI"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1518","fieldValue":"An Analysis of Age, Technology Usage, and Cognitive Characteristics Within Information Retrieval Tasks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6229","fieldValue":" Reconfiguration delay is one of the major barriers in the way of dynamically adapting a system to its application requirements. The run-time reconfiguration delay is quite comparable to the application latency for many classes of applications and might even dominate the application run-time. In this paper, we present an efficient optimal algorithm for minimizing the run-time reconfiguration (context switching) delay of executing an application on a dynamically adaptable system. The system is composed of a number of cameras with embedded reconfigurable resources collaborating in order to track an object. The operations required to execute in order to track the object are revealed to the system at run-time and can change according to a number of parameters, such as the target shape and proximity. Similarly, we can assume that the applications comprising tasks are already scheduled and each of them has to be realized on the reconfigurable fabric in order to be executed.The modeling and the algorithm are both applicable to partially reconfigurable platforms as well as multi-FPGA systems. The algorithm can be directly applied to minimize the application run-time for the typical classes of applications, where the actual execution delay of the basic operations is negligible compared to the reconfiguration delay. We prove the optimality and the efficiency of our algorithm. We report the experimental results, which demonstrate a 2.5--40&percnt; improvement on the total run-time reconfiguration delay as compared to other heuristics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6230","fieldValue":" This paper presents a top-down designer-driven design flow for creating hardware that exploits partial run-time reconfiguration. Computer-aided design (CAD) tools are presented, which complement conventional FPGA design environments to enable the specification, simulation (both functional and timing), synthesis, automatic placement and routing, partial configuration generation and control of partially reconfigurable designs. Collectively these tools constitute the dynamic circuit switching CAD framework. A partially reconfigurable Viterbi decoder design is presented to demonstrate the design flow and illustrate possible power consumption reductions and performance improvements through the exploitation of partial reconfiguration."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6230","fieldValue":"FPGA"}
