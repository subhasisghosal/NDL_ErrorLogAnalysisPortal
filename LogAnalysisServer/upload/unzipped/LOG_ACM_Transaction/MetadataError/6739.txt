Exact algorithms for these problems exist and are widely used, but their running time is hindered by the need of scanning the entire dataset, possibly multiple times. High-quality approximations of FIs and ARs are sufficient for most practical uses. Sampling techniques can be used for fast discovery of approximate solutions, but works exploring this technique did not provide satisfactory performance guarantees on the quality of the approximation due to the difficulty of bounding the probability of under- or oversampling any one of an unknown number of frequent itemsets. We circumvent this issue by applying the statistical concept of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension to develop a novel technique for providing tight bounds on the sample size that guarantees approximation of the (top-K) FIs and ARs within user-specified parameters. The resulting sample size is linearly dependent on the VC-dimension of a range space associated with the dataset. We analyze the VC-dimension of this range space and show that it is upper bounded by an easy-to-compute characteristic quantity of the dataset, the d-index, namely, the maximum integer d such that the dataset contains at least d transactions of length at least d such that no one of them is a superset of or equal to another. We show that this bound is tight for a large class of datasets. The resulting sample size is a significant improvement over previous known results. We present an extensive experimental evaluation of our technique on real and artificial datasets, demonstrating the practicality of our methods, and showing that they achieve even higher quality approximations than what is guaranteed by the analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7980","fieldValue":"Efficient Discovery of Association Rules and Frequent Itemsets through Sampling with Tight Performance Guarantees"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7981","fieldValue":"Burton, Scott H"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7981","fieldValue":"Giraud-Carrier, Christophe G"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7981","fieldValue":" We examine the problem of identifying social circles, or sets of cohesive and mutually aware nodes surrounding an initial query set, in directed graphs where the complete graph is not known beforehand. This problem differs from local community mining, in that the query set defines the circle of interest. We explicitly handle edge direction, as in many cases relationships are not symmetric, and focus on the local context because many real-world graphs cannot be feasibly known. We outline several issues that are unique to this context, introduce a quality function to measure the value of including a particular node in an emerging social circle, and describe a greedy social circle discovery algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on artificial benchmarks, large networks with topical community labels, and several real-world case studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7982","fieldValue":"Magdon-Ismail, Malik"}
