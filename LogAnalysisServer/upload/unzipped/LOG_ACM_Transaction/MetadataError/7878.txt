Scheduling (who, where, when) and system configuration (how) are fundamental problems in radio communication and wireless networking. Optimization decomposition based on Lagrangian relaxation of signal quality requirements provides a mathematical framework for solving this type of combined problem. This paper demonstrates the technique as a solution to spatial reuse time-division multiple access (STDMA) scheduling with reconfigurable antennas. The joint beam steering and scheduling (JBSS) problem offers both a challenging mathematical structure and significant practical value. We present algorithms for JBSS and describe an implemented system based on these algorithms. We achieve up to 600% of the throughput of TDMA with a mean of 234% in our experiments. The decomposition approach leads to a working distributed protocol producing optimal solutions in an amount of time that is at worst linear in the size of the input. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first actually implemented wireless scheduling system based on dual decomposition. We identify and briefly address some of the challenges that arise in taking such a system from theory to reality."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10570","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10570","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10570","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10571","fieldValue":" We consider the multiple-unicast problem with three sourceâ\u20AC\u201Cterminal pairs over directed acyclic networks with unit-capacity edges. The three $s_i{\\hbox{â\u20AC\u201C}}t_i$ pairs wish to communicate at unit-rate via network coding. The connectivity between the $s_i{\\hbox{â\u20AC\u201C}}t_i$ pairs is quantified by means of a connectivity-level vector, $[k_1\\ k_2\\ k_3]$ such that there exist $k_i$ edge-disjoint paths between $s_i$ and $t_i$. In this paper, we attempt to classify networks based on the connectivity level. It can be observed that unit-rate transmission can be supported by routing if $k_i \\geq 3$, for all $i = 1, \\ldots, 3$. In this paper, we consider connectivity-level vectors such that $\\min_{i = 1, \\ldots, 3} k_i < 3$. We present either a constructive linear network coding scheme or an instance of a network that cannot support the desired unit-rate requirement, for all such connectivity-level vectors except the vector [1 2 4] (and its permutations). The benefits of our schemes extend to networks with higher and potentially different edge capacities. Specifically, our experimental results indicate that for networks where the different sourceâ\u20AC\u201Cterminal paths have a significant overlap, our constructive unit-rate schemes can be packed along with routing to provide higher throughput as compared to a pure routing approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10571","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10571","fieldValue":"ACM"}
