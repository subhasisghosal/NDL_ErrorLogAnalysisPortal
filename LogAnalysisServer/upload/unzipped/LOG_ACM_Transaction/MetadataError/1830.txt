The degrees of freedom are coordinate frames. In contrast with traditional skinning, frame positions are not scripted but move in reaction to internal body forces. The displacement field is smoothly interpolated using dual quaternion blending. The deformation gradient and its derivatives are computed at each sample point of a deformed object and used in the equations of Lagrangian mechanics to achieve physical realism. This allows easy and very intuitive definition of the degrees of freedom of the deformable object. The meshless discretization allows on-the-fly insertion of frames to create local deformations where needed. We formulate the dynamics of these models in detail and describe some precomputations that can be used for speed. We show that our method is effective for behaviors ranging from simple unimodal deformations to complex realistic deformations comparable with Finite Element simulations. To encourage its use, the software will be freely available in the simulation platform SOFA."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16413","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16413","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2556","fieldValue":" In this article, the online pull-based broadcast model is considered. In this model, there are n pages of data stored at a server and requests arrive for pages online. When the server broadcasts page p, all outstanding requests for the same page p are simultaneously satisfied. We consider the problem of minimizing average (total) flow time online where all pages are unit-sized. For this problem, there has been a decade-long search for an online algorithm which is scalable, that is, (1 + &epsi;)-speed O(1)-competitive for any fixed &epsi; > 0. In this article, we give the first analysis of an online scalable algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2556","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2556","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16414","fieldValue":" A physics-based control system that tracks a single motion trajectory produces high-quality animations, but does not recover from large disturbances that require deviating from this tracked trajectory. In order to enhance the responsiveness of physically simulated characters, we introduce algorithms that construct composite controllers that track multiple trajectories in parallel instead of sequentially switching from one control to the other. The composite controllers can blend or transition between different path controllers at arbitrary times according to the current system state. As a result, a composite control system generates both high-quality animations and natural responses to certain disturbances. We demonstrate its potential for improving robustness in performing several locomotion tasks. Then we consolidate these controllers into graphs that allow us to direct the character in real time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16414","fieldValue":"ACM"}
