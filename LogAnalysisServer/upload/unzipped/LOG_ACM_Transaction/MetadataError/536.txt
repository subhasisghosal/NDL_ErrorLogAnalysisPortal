The system produces a multilevel circuit using heuristic rules based on properties of a subset of spectral coefficients. Since the behavioral description is in OBDD form, efficient methods are used to quickly compute the small subset of spectral coefficients needed for the application of the heuristics. The heuristics guide subsequent decompositions of the OBDD, resulting in an iterative construction of the structural form. At each stage of the translation, the form of the decomposition is chosen in order to achieve optimization goals."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12752","fieldValue":"Cheng, Wei-Kai"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12752","fieldValue":"Lin, Youn-Long"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12752","fieldValue":" We propose a microcode-optimizing method targeting a programmable DSP processor. Efficient generation of microcodes is essential to better utilize the computation power of a DSP processor. Since most state-of-the-art DSP processors feature some sort of irregular architectures and most DSP applications have nested loop constructs, their code generation is a nontrivial task. In this paper, we consider two features frequently found in contemporary DSP processors â\u20AC\u201D structural pipelining and heterogeneous registers. We propose a code generator that performs instruction scheduling and register allocation simultaneously. The proposed approach has been implemented and evaluated using a set of benchmark core algorithms. Simulation of the generated codes targeted towards the TI TMS320C40 DSP processor shows that our system is indeed more effective compared with a commercial optimizing DSP compiler."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12752","fieldValue":"DSP"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12752","fieldValue":"Code generation of nested loops for DSP processors with heterogeneous registers and structural pipelining"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12752","fieldValue":"ACM"}
