In reality, however, this is not true. Although there are proposed methods to reconstruct haplotypes from genome sequencing projects, an accuracy assessment is required to evaluate the confidence of the estimated diploid consensus sequences. In this paper, we define the confidence score of diploid consensus sequences. It requires the calculation of the likelihood of an assembly. To calculate the likelihood, we propose a linear time algorithm with respect to the number of polymorphic sites. The likelihood calculation and confidence score are used for further improvements of haplotype estimation in two directions. One direction is that low-scored phases are disconnected. The other direction is that, instead of using nominal frequency 1\/2, the haplotype frequency is estimated to reflect the actual contribution of each haplotype. Our method was evaluated on the simulated data whose polymorphism rate (1.2 percent) was based on Ciona intestinalis. As a result, the high accuracy of our algorithm was indicated: The true positive rate of the haplotype estimation was greater than 97 percent."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4274","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4275","fieldValue":" Breakpoint graph analysis is a key algorithmic technique in studies of genome rearrangements. However, breakpoint graphs are defined only for genomes without duplicated genes, thus limiting their applications in rearrangement analysis. We discuss a connection between the breakpoint graphs and de Bruijn graphs that leads to a generalization of the notion of breakpoint graph for genomes with duplicated genes. We further use the generalized breakpoint graphs to study the Genome Halving Problem (first introduced and solved by Nadia El-Mabrouk and David Sankoff). The El-Mabrouk-Sankoff algorithm is rather complex, and, in this paper, we present an alternative approach that is based on generalized breakpoint graphs. The generalized breakpoint graphs make the El-Mabrouk-Sankoff result more transparent and promise to be useful in future studies of genome rearrangements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4275","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4275","fieldValue":"Genome duplication, genome halving, genome rearrangement, reversal, breakpoint graph, de Bruijn graph."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4275","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4275","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4276","fieldValue":" We study distorted metrics on binary trees in the context of phylogenetic reconstruction. Given a binary tree T on n leaves with a path metric d, consider the pairwise distances {d(u,v)} between leaves. It is well known that these determine the tree and the d length of all edges. Here, we consider distortions $\\hat{d}$ of d such that, for all leaves u and v, it holds that $|d(u,v) - \\hat{d}(u,v)|< f\/2$ if either d(u,v)< M + f\/2 or $\\hat{d}(u,v)< M + f\/2$, where d satisfies f â\u2030¤ d(e) â\u2030¤ g for all edges e. Given such distortions, we show how to reconstruct in polynomial time a forest T1, ... ,TÎ± such that the true tree T may be obtained from that forest by adding Î±-1 edges and Î±-1 â\u2030¤ 2-Î©(M\/g) n. Our distorted metric result implies a reconstruction algorithm of phylogenetic forests with a small number of trees from sequences of length logarithmic in the number of species. The reconstruction algorithm is applicable for the general Markov model. Both the distorted metric result and its applications to phylogeny are almost tight."}
