Coupled with an algorithm for incremental updates to a sparse Cholesky factorization, the method realizes the stability and scalability of a sparse direct method without the need for expensive refactorization at each time step. This finite element formulation combines the widely used corotational method with stiffness warping so that changes in the per-element rotations are initially approximated by inexpensive per-node rotations. When the errors of this approximation grow too large, the per-element rotations are selectively corrected by updating parts of the matrix chosen according to locally measured errors. These changes to the system matrix are propagated to its Cholesky factor by incremental updates that are much faster than refactoring the matrix from scratch. A nested dissection ordering of the system matrix gives rise to a hierarchical factorization in which changes to the system matrix cause limited, well-structured changes to the Cholesky factor. We show examples of simulations that demonstrate that the proposed formulation produces results that are visually comparable to those produced by a standard corotational formulation. Because our method requires computing only partial updates of the Cholesky factor, it is substantially faster than full refactorization and outperforms widely used iterative methods such as preconditioned conjugate gradients. Our method supports a controlled trade-off between accuracy and speed, and unlike most iterative methods its performance does not slow for stiffer materials but rather it actually improves."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16713","fieldValue":" We introduce a simple formula for 4-point planar warping that produces provably good 2D deformations. In contrast to previous work, the new deformations minimize the maximum conformal distortion and spread the distortion equally across the domain. We derive closed-form formulas for computing the 4-point interpolant and analyze its properties. We further explore applications to 2D shape deformations by building local deformation operators that use thin-plate splines to further deform the 4-point interpolant to satisfy certain boundary conditions. Although this modification no longer has any theoretical guarantees, we demonstrate that, practically, these local operators can be used to create compound deformations with fewer control points and smaller worst-case distortions in comparisons to the state-of-the-art."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16713","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16713","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16714","fieldValue":" We investigate global illumination in 2D and show how this simplified problem domain leads to practical insights for 3D rendering. We first derive a full theory of 2D light transport by introducing 2D analogs to radiometric quantities such as flux and radiance, and deriving a 2D rendering equation. We use our theory to show how to implement algorithms such as Monte Carlo raytracing, path tracing, irradiance caching, and photon mapping in 2D, and demonstrate that these algorithms can be analyzed more easily in this domain while still providing insights for 3D rendering. We apply our theory to develop several practical improvements to the irradiance caching algorithm. We perform a full second-order analysis of diffuse indirect illumination, first in 2D, and then in 3D by deriving the irradiance Hessian, and show how this leads to increased accuracy and performance for irradiance caching. We propose second-order Taylor expansion from cache points, which results in more accurate irradiance reconstruction. We also introduce a novel error metric to guide cache point placement by analyzing the error produced by irradiance caching. Our error metric naturally supports anisotropic reconstruction and, in our preliminary study, resulted in an order of magnitude less error than the â\u20ACœsplit-sphereâ\u20AC? heuristic when using the same number of cache points."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16714","fieldValue":"ACM"}
