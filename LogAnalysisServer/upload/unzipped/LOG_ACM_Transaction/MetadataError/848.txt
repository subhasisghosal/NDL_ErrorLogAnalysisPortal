To effectively exploit these delay variations, we propose dynamically adaptable resilient pipeline (DARP)â\u20AC\u201Da series of runtime techniques to boost power-performance efficiency and fault tolerance in a pipelined microprocessor. DARP employs early error prediction to avoid a major portion of the timing errors. We combine DARP with the state-of-art topologically homogeneous and power-performance heterogeneous (THPH) architecture to build up a new frontier for the energy efficiency of multicore processors (DARP-MP). Using a rigorous circuit-architectural infrastructure, we demonstrate that DARP substantially improves the multicore processor performance (9.4--20&percnt;) and energy efficiency (10--28.6&percnt;) compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The energy-efficiency improvements of DARP-MP are 42&percnt; and 49.9&percnt; compared against the original THPH and another state-of-art multicore power management scheme, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13467","fieldValue":" Fast allocation of large blocks of physically contiguous memory plays a crucial role to boost the performance of multimedia applications in modern memory-constrained portable devices, such as smartphones, tablets, etc. Existing systems have addressed this issue by provisioning a large statically reserved memory area (SRA) in which only dedicated applications can allocate pages. However, this in turn degrades the performance of applications that are prohibited to utilize the SRA due to the reduced available memory pool. To overcome this drawback while maintaining the benefits of the SRA, we propose a new memory management scheme that uses a special memory region, called page-cache-preferred area (PCPA), in concert with a quick memory reclaiming algorithm. The key of the proposed scheme is to enhance the memory utilization efficiency by enabling to allocate page-cached pages of all applications in the PCPA until predetermined applications require to allocate big chunks of contiguous memory. At this point, clean page-cached pages in the PCPA are rapidly evicted without write-back to a secondary storage. Compared to the SRA scheme, experimental results show that the average launch time of real-world applications and the execution time of I\/O-intensive benchmarks are reduced by 9.2&percnt; and 24.7&percnt;, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13467","fieldValue":"Memory Management Scheme to Improve Utilization Efficiency and Provide Fast Contiguous Allocation without a Statically Reserved Area"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13468","fieldValue":" Microprocessors fabricated at nanoscale nodes are exposed to accelerated transistor aging due to bias temperature instability and hot carrier injection. As a result, device delays increase over time, reducing the mean time to failure (MTTF) and hence lifetime of the processor. To address this challenge, many (micro)-architectural techniques target the execution stage of the instruction pipeline, as this one is typically most critical. However, also the decoding stages can become aging critical and limit the microprocessor lifetime, as we will show in this work. Therefore, we propose a novel aging-aware instruction set-encoding methodology (ArISE) that improves the instruction encoding iteratively using a heuristic algorithm. In addition, the switching activities of the affected memory elements are considered in order to co-optimize lifetime and energy efficiency. Our experimental results show that MTTF of the decoding stages can be improved by 2.3Ã\u2014 with negligible implementation costs."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13468","fieldValue":"BTI"}
