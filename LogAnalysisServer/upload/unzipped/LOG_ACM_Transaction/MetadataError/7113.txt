{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9052","fieldValue":" This paper proposes a simple rate-based scheduling algorithm for packet-switched networks. Using a set of counters to keep track of the credits accumulated by each traffic flow, the bandwidth share allocated to each flow, and the size of the head-of-line (HOL) packets of the different flows, the algorithm decides which flow to serve next. Our proposed algorithm requires on average a smaller complexity than the most interesting alternative ones while guaranteeing comparable fairness, delay, and delay jitter bounds. To further reduce the complexity, a simplified version (CBFQ-F) of the general algorithm is also proposed for networks with fixed packet lengths, such as ATM, by relaxing the fairness bound by a negligibly small amount."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9052","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9052","fieldValue":"Credit-based fair queueing (CBFQ): a simple service-scheduling algorithm for packet-switched networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9052","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9052","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9053","fieldValue":" The concept of tracking fluid policies by packetized policies is extended to input queueing switches. It is considered that the speedup of the switch is one. One of the interesting applications of the tracking policy in TDMA satellite switches is elaborated. For the special case of 2 Ã\u2014 2 switches, it is shown that a tracking nonanticipative policy always exists. It is found that, in general, nonanticipative policies do not exist for switches with more than two input and output ports. For the general case of N Ã\u2014 N switches, a heuristic tracking policy is provided. The heuristic algorithm is based on two notions: port tracking and critical links. These notions can be employed in the derivation of other heuristic tracking policies as well. Simulation results show the usefulness of the heuristic algorithm and the two basic concepts it relies on."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9053","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9053","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9053","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9054","fieldValue":" Overloads that occur during times of network stress result in blocked access to all users, independent of importance. These overloads can occur because of degraded resource availability or abnormally high demand. Public broadband networks must dynamically recognize some multimedia connections as having greater importance than others and allocate resources accordingly. A new approach to connection admission control is proposed that uses an upper limit policy to optimize the admission of connections based on the weighted sum of blocking across traffic classes. This results in a simple algorithm suitable for multimedia and packet networks. This work is also the first to demonstrate that the use of an upper limit policy is superior to traditional approaches of adding extra capacity or partitioning capacity, both in terms of the amount of resources required and sensitivity to load variations. An upper limit policy can also be deployed much faster when a large overload occurs from a disaster event."}
