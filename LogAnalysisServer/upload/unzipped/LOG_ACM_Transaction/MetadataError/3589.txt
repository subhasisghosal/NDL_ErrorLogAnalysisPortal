The FPGA community has only recently started focusing on the effects of variations. In this work we present a statistical analysis to compare the effects of variations on designs mapped to FPGAs and ASICs. We also present CAD and architecture techniques to mitigate the impact of variations. First we present a variation-aware router that optimizes statistical criticality. We then propose a modification to the clock network to deliver programmable skews to different flip-flops. Finally, we combine the two techniques and the result is a 9x reduction in yield loss that translates to a 12% improvement in timing yield. When the desired timing yield is set to 99%, our combined statistical routing and skew assignment technique results in a delay improvement of about 10% over a purely deterministic approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21691","fieldValue":"Lu, Shih-Lien L"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21691","fieldValue":" Advancements in reconfigurable technologies, specifically FPGAs, have yielded faster, more power-efficient reconfigurable devices with enormous capacities. In our work, we provide testament to the impressive capacity of recent FPGAs by hosting a complete $Pentium^® in a single FPGA chip. In addition we demonstrate how FPGAs can be used for microprocessor design space exploration while overcoming the tension between simulation speed, model accuracy, and model completeness found in traditional software simulator environments. Specifically, we perform preliminary experimentation\/prototyping with an original Socket 7 based desktop processor system with typical hardware peripherals running modern operating systems such as Fedora Core 4 and Windows XP; however we have inserted a Xilinx Virtex-4 in place of the processor that should sit in the motherboard and have used the Virtex-4 to host a complete version of the Pentium®$ microprocessor (which consumes less than half its resources). We can therefore apply architectural changes to the processor and evaluate their effects on the complete desktop system. We use this FPGA-based emulation system to conduct preliminary architectural experiments including growing the branch target buffer and the level 1 caches. In addition, we experimented with interfacing hardware accelerators such as DES and AES engines which resulted in a 27x speedup."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21691","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/21691","fieldValue":"Pentium&reg;"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21691","fieldValue":"ACM"}
