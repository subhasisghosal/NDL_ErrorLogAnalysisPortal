In current practice these curves are generated by ad hoc random processes, and in close-up views their arrangement appears plainly different from real hair. To begin improving this situation, this paper presents a new method for measuring the detailed arrangement of fibers in a hair assembly. Many macrophotographs with shallow depth of field are taken of a sample of hair, sweeping the plane of focus through the hair's volume. The shallow depth of field helps isolate the fibers and reduces occlusion. Several sweeps are performed with the hair at different orientations, resulting in multiple observations of most of the clearly visible fibers. The images are filtered to detect the fibers, and the resulting feature data from all images is used jointly in a hair growing process to construct smooth curves along the observed fibers. Finally, additional hairs are generated to fill in the unseen volume inside the hair. The method is demonstrated on both straight and wavy hair, with results suitable for realistic close-up renderings. These models provide the first views we know of into the 3D arrangement of hair fibers in real hair assemblies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16203","fieldValue":" In this work a practical approach to photometric acquisition of hair color is presented. Based on a single input photograph of a simple setup we are able to extract physically plausible optical properties of hair and to render virtual hair closely matching the original. Our approach does not require any costly special hardware but a standard consumer camera only."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16203","fieldValue":"BCSDF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16203","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16203","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16204","fieldValue":" Despite the visual importance of hair and the attention paid to hair modeling in the graphics research, modeling realistic hair still remains a very challenging task that can be performed by very few artists. In this paper we present hair meshes, a new method for modeling hair that aims to bring hair modeling as close as possible to modeling polygonal surfaces. This new approach provides artists with direct control of the overall shape of the hair, giving them the ability to model the exact hair shape they desire. We use the hair mesh structure for modeling the hair volume with topological constraints that allow us to automatically and uniquely trace the path of individual hair strands through this volume. We also define a set of topological operations for creating hair meshes that maintain these constraints. Furthermore, we provide a method for hiding the volumetric structure of the hair mesh from the end user, thus allowing artists to concentrate on manipulating the outer surface of the hair as a polygonal surface. We explain and show examples of how hair meshes can be used to generate individual hair strands for a wide variety of realistic hair styles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16204","fieldValue":"ACM"}
