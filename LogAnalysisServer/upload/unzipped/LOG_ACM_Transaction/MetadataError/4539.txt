We propose an approach that is appropriate when the uncertainty intrinsic in some models cannot be reduced by traditional identification techniques, due to the impossibility of gathering experimental data about the system itself. The article presents a methodology for qualitative modeling and simulation of approximately known systems. The proposed solution is based on the Fuzzy Sets theory, extending the power of traditional numerical-logical methods. We have implemented a fuzzy simulator that integrates a fuzzy, qualitative approach and traditional, quantitative methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24733","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24733","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24734","fieldValue":" This article describes and evaluates an efficient execution-driven technique for the simulation of multiprocessors that includes the simulation of system memory and that is driven by real program work loads. The technique produces correctly interleaved address traces at run-time without disk access overhead or hardware support, allowing accurate simulation of the effects of a variety of architectural alternatives on programs. We have implemented a simulator based on this technique that offers substantial advantages in terms of reduced time and space overheads when compared to instruction-driven or trace-driven simulation techniques, without significant loss of accuracy. The article presents the results of several validation experiments used to quantify the accuracy and efficiency of the simulator for sequential, distributed, and shared-memory multiprocessors, and several parallel programs. These experiments show that prediction errors of less than 5 percent as compared to actual execution times, and overheads 6 to 30 times lower than those incurred by cycle-level simulation can be achieved. Predictions of relative performance metrics such as speedup tend to be even more accurate, making this technique especially attractive as an efficient method for comparative investigations of parallel system designs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24735","fieldValue":"Eichenauer-Herrmann, Jrgen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24735","fieldValue":" A new algorithm, the digital inversive method, for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers is introduced. This algorithm starts from an inversive recursion in a large finite field and derives pseudorandom numbers from it by the digital method. If the underlying finite field has q elements, then the sequences of digital inversive pseudorandom numbers with maximum possible period length q can be characterized. Sequences of multiprecision pseudorandom numbers with very large period lengths are easily obtained by this new method. Digital inversive pseudorandom numbers satisfy statistical independence properties that are close to those of truly random numbers in the sense of asymptotic discrepancy. If q is a power of 2, then the digital inversive method can be implemented in a very fast manner."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24735","fieldValue":"ACM"}
