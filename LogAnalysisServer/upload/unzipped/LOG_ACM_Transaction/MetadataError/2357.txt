Two major issues have been shown to hinder the efficiency of the existing solutions: light transport due to multiple highly glossy or specular interactions, and scenes with complex visibility between the camera and light sources. While recent bidirectional path sampling methods such as vertex connection and merging\/unified path sampling (VCM\/UPS) efficiently deal with highly glossy or specular transport, they tend to perform poorly in scenes with complex visibility. On the other hand, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been able to show some excellent results in scenes with complex visibility, but they behave unpredictably in scenes with glossy or specular surfaces due to their fundamental issue of sample correlation. In this paper, we show how to fuse the underlying key ideas behind VCM\/UPS and MCMC into a single, efficient light transport solution. Our algorithm is specifically designed to retain the advantages of both approaches, while alleviating their limitations. Our experiments show that the algorithm can efficiently render scenes with both highly glossy or specular materials and complex visibility, without compromising the performance in simpler cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17742","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17743","fieldValue":" We present a novel approach to improve temporal coherence in Monte Carlo renderings of animation sequences. Unlike other approaches that exploit temporal coherence in a post-process, our technique does so already during sampling. Building on previous gradient-domain rendering techniques that sample finite differences over the image plane, we introduce temporal finite differences and formulate a corresponding 3D spatio-temporal screened Poisson reconstruction problem that is solved over windowed batches of several frames simultaneously. We further extend our approach to include second order, mixed spatio-temporal differences, an improved technique to compute temporal differences exploiting motion vectors, and adaptive sampling. Our algorithm can be built on a gradient-domain path tracer without large modifications. In particular, we do not require the ability to evaluate animation paths over multiple frames. We demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces temporal flickering in animation sequences, significantly improving the visual quality compared to both path tracing and gradient-domain rendering of individual frames."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17743","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17743","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17744","fieldValue":"Ahmed, Abdalla G M"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17744","fieldValue":"Yan, Dong-Ming"}
