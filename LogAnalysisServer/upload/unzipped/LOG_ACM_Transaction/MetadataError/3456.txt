Several VCS-based routing protocols have been proposed in the last few years, all assuming that nodes behave correctly. However, many applications require deploying sensor networks in adversarial environments, making VCS-based routing protocols vulnerable to numerous attacks. In this article, we study the security of VCS-based routing protocols, with a focus on the unique component of VCS-based routing protocols, the virtual coordinate system. We first identify the security requirements of a correctly functioning VCS-based routing protocol and a set of novel attacks that can result in the violation of each of the identified requirements. The attacks target the underlying virtual coordinate system and can be mounted with low resources. However, they are epidemic in nature and are highly destructive to system performance. We then propose lightweight defense mechanisms designed specifically for resource-constrained sensor networks against each of the identified attacks. The proposed techniques require only local information on sensor nodes and take into account the unreliable nature of wireless links and network churn. Finally, we evaluate experimentally the impact of the attacks and the effectiveness of our defense mechanisms using a well-known VCS-based routing protocol, BVR. Our experiments show that the proposed techniques successfully mitigate all the identified attacks under a realistic link model and even at a high level of network churn."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21317","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21317","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21318","fieldValue":" Location information is of essential importance in sensor networks deployed for generating location-specific event reports. When such networks operate in hostile environments, it becomes imperative to guarantee the correctness of event location claims. In this article we address the problem of assessing location claims of untrusted (potentially compromised) nodes. The mechanisms introduced here prevent a compromised node from generating illicit event reports for locations other than its own. This is important because by compromising â\u20ACœeasy targetâ\u20AC? sensors (say, sensors on the perimeter of the field that's easier to access), the adversary should not be able to impact data flows associated with other (â\u20ACœpremium targetâ\u20AC?) regions of the network. To achieve this goal, in a process we call location certification, data routed through the network is â\u20ACœtaggedâ\u20AC? by participating nodes with â\u20ACœbeliefâ\u20AC? ratings, collaboratively assessing the probability that the claimed source location is indeed correct. The effectiveness of our solution relies on the joint knowledge of participating nodes to assess the truthfulness of claimed locations. By collaboratively generating and propagating a set of â\u20ACœbeliefâ\u20AC? ratings with transmitted data and event reports, the network allows authorized parties (e.g., final data sinks) to evaluate a metric of trust for the claimed location of such reports. Belief ratings are derived from a data model of observed past routing activity. The solution is shown to feature a strong ability to detect false location claims and compromised nodes. For example, incorrect claims as small as 2 hops (from the actual location) are detected with over 90&percnt; accuracy. Finally, these new location certification mechanisms can be deployed in tandem with traditional secure localization, yet do not require it, and, in a sense, can serve to minimize the need thereof."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21318","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21318","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21319","fieldValue":"Gupta, Sandeep K S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21319","fieldValue":" A Body Sensor Network (BSN) is a network of economically powered, wireless, wearable, and implanted health monitoring sensors, designed to continually collect and communicate health information from the host they are deployed on. Due to the sensitive nature of the data collected, securing BSNs is important for privacy preservation and protecting the host from bodily harm. In this article, we present Physiological Value-based Security (PVS), a usable and efficient way of securing intersensor communication schemes for BSNs. The PVS scheme distributes the key used for securing a particular message along with the message itself, by hiding it using physiological values. In this way, it not only eliminates the need for any explicit key distribution, but also reduces the number of keys required at each node to meet all its secure communication requirements. We further demonstrate the use of the PVS scheme in securing cluster topology formation in BSNs. Traditional protocols for cluster formation do not consider security and are therefore susceptible to malicious attacks. We present a PVS-based cluster formation protocol which mitigates these attacks. Performance analysis of the protocol shows that compared to cluster formation protocols secured with non-PVS-based key distribution schemes, it performs efficiently."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21319","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21319","fieldValue":"ACM"}
