{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16491","fieldValue":" We propose a method for learning linear upsampling operators for physically-based cloth simulation, allowing us to enrich coarse meshes with mid-scale details in minimal time and memory budgets, as required in computer games. In contrast to classical subdivision schemes, our operators adapt to a specific context (e.g. a flag flapping in the wind or a skirt worn by a character), which allows them to achieve higher detail. Our method starts by pre-computing a pair of coarse and fine training simulations aligned with tracking constraints using harmonic test functions. Next, we train the upsampling operators with a new regularization method that enables us to learn mid-scale details without overfitting. We demonstrate generalizability to unseen conditions such as different wind velocities or novel character motions. Finally, we discuss how to re-introduce high frequency details not explainable by the coarse mesh alone using oscillatory modes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2563","fieldValue":" In the Steiner Network problem, we are given a graph G with edge-costs and connectivity requirements $r_uv between node pairs u,v. The goal is to find a minimum-cost subgraph H of G that contains ruv edge-disjoint paths for all u,v ∈ V. In Prize-Collecting Steiner Network problems, we do not need to satisfy all requirements, but are given a penalty function for violating the connectivity requirements, and the goal is to find a subgraph H that minimizes the cost plus the penalty. The case when ruv$ ∈ {0,1} is the classic Prize-Collecting Steiner Forest problem. In this article, we present a novel linear programming relaxation for the Prize-Collecting Steiner Network problem, and by rounding it, obtain the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for submodular and monotone nondecreasing penalty functions. In particular, our setting includes all-or-nothing penalty functions, which charge the penalty even if the connectivity requirement is slightly violated; this resolves an open question posed by Nagarajan et al. [2008]. We further generalize our results for element-connectivity and node-connectivity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2563","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2563","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16492","fieldValue":" Stereoscopic 3D has gained significant importance in the entertainment industry. However, production of high quality stereoscopic content is still a challenging art that requires mastering the complex interplay of human perception, 3D display properties, and artistic intent. In this paper, we present a computational stereo camera system that closes the control loop from capture and analysis to automatic adjustment of physical parameters. Intuitive interaction metaphors are developed that replace cumbersome handling of rig parameters using a touch screen interface with 3D visualization. Our system is designed to make stereoscopic 3D production as easy, intuitive, flexible, and reliable as possible. Captured signals are processed and analyzed in real-time on a stream processor. Stereoscopy and user settings define programmable control functionalities, which are executed in real-time on a control processor. Computational power and flexibility is enabled by a dedicated software and hardware architecture. We show that even traditionally difficult shots can be easily captured using our system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16493","fieldValue":" We develop tomographic techniques for image synthesis on displays composed of compact volumes of light-attenuating material. Such volumetric attenuators recreate a 4D light field or high-contrast 2D image when illuminated by a uniform backlight. Since arbitrary oblique views may be inconsistent with any single attenuator, iterative tomographic reconstruction minimizes the difference between the emitted and target light fields, subject to physical constraints on attenuation. As multi-layer generalizations of conventional parallax barriers, such displays are shown, both by theory and experiment, to exceed the performance of existing dual-layer architectures. For 3D display, spatial resolution, depth of field, and brightness are increased, compared to parallax barriers. For a plane at a fixed depth, our optimization also allows optimal construction of high dynamic range displays, confirming existing heuristics and providing the first extension to multiple, disjoint layers. We conclude by demonstrating the benefits and limitations of attenuation-based light field displays using an inexpensive fabrication method: separating multiple printed transparencies with acrylic sheets."}
