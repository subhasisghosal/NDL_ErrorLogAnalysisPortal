Since each input port can switch up to m cells in a time slot, one from each queue, it hardly suffers from the head-of-line (HOL) blocking which is known as the decisive factor limiting the throughput of the single input-queued (SIQ) switch. As the result, the MIQ switch guarantees enhanced performance characteristics as the number of queues m in an input increases. However, the service of multiple cells from an input could cause the internal speedup or expansion of the switch fabric, diluting the merit of high-speed operation in the conventional SIQ scheme. The restricted rule is contrived to circumvent this side effect by regulating the number of cells switched from an input port. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the MIQ switch employing the restricted rule. For the switch using the restricted rule, the closed formulas for the throughput bound, the mean cell delay and average queue length, and the cell loss bound of the switch are derived as the function of m, by generalizing the analysis for the SIQ switch by Hui et al., 1987."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9173","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9174","fieldValue":" We address the issue of optimal energy allocation and admission control for communications satellites in earth orbit. Such satellites receive requests for transmission as they orbit the earth, but may not be able to serve them all, due to energy limitations. The objective is to choose which requests to serve so that the expected total reward is maximized. The special case of a single energy-constrained satellite is considered. Rewards and demands from users for transmission (energy) are random and known only at request time. Using a dynamic programming approach, an optimal policy is derived and is characterized in terms of thresholds. Furthermore, in the special case where demand for energy is unlimited, an optimal policy is obtained in closed form. Although motivated by satellite communications, our approach is general and can be used to solve a variety of resource allocation problems in wireless communications."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9174","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9174","fieldValue":"ACM"}
