{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23721","fieldValue":" Three recent trends in database research are object-oriented and deductive databases and graph-based user interfaces. We draw these trends together in a data model we call the Hypernode Model. The single data structure of this model is the hypernode, a graph whose nodes can themselves be graphs. Hypernodes are typed, and types, too, are nested graphs. We give the theoretical foundations of hypernodes and types, and we show that type checking is tractable. We show also how conventional type-forming operators can be simulated by our graph types, including cyclic types. The Hypernode Model comes equipped with a rule-based query language called Hyperlog, which is complete with respect to computation and update. We define the operational semantics of Hyperlog and show that the evaluation can be performed efficiently. We discuss also the use of Hyperlog for supporting database browsing, an essential feature of Hypertext databases. We compare our work with other graph-based data modelsâ\u20AC\u201Dunlike previous graph-based models, the Hypernode Model provides inherent support for data abstraction via its nesting of graphs. Finally, we briefly discuss the implementation of a DBMS based on the Hypernode Model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23721","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23721","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23722","fieldValue":" Two main topics are addressed. First, an algebraic approach is presented to define a general notion of expressive power. Heterogeneous algebras represent information systems and morphisms represent the correspondences between the instances of databases, the correspondences between answers, and the correspondences between queries. An important feature of this new notion of expressive power is that query languages of different types can be compared with respect to their expressive power. In the case of relational query languages, the new notion of expressive power is shown to be equivalent to the notion used by Chandra and Harel. In the case of nonrelational query languages, the versatility of the new notion of expressive power is demonstrated by comparing the fixpoint query languages with an object-oriented query language called FQL. The expressive power of the Functional Query Language FQL is the second main topic of this paper. The specifications of FQL functions can be recursive or even mutually recursive, FQL has a fixpoint semantics based on a complete lattice consisting of bag functions. The query language FQL is shown to be more expressive than the fixpoint query languages. This result implies that FQL is also more expressive than Datalog with stratified negation. Examples of recursive FQL functions are given that determine the ancestors of persons and the bill of materials."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23722","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23722","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23723","fieldValue":" We show that former approaches in probabilistic information retrieval are based on one or two of the three concepts abstraction, inductive learning, and probabilistic assumptions, and we propose a new approach which combines all three concepts. This approach is illustrated for the case of indexing with a controlled vocabulary. For this purpose, we describe a new probabilistic model first, which is then combined with logistic regression, thus yielding a generalization of the original model. Experimental results for the pure theoretical model as well as for heuristic variants are given. Furthermore, linear and logistic regression are compared."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23723","fieldValue":"Probabilistic information retrieval as a combination of abstraction, inductive learning, and probabilistic assumptions"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23723","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23723","fieldValue":"ACM"}
