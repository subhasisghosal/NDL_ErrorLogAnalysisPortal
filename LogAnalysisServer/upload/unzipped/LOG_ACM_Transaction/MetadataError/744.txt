Typically, these systems are based on wireless sensor nodes, and should utilize very low energy during their lifetimes, as they are powered by scavengers. In this article, we present an ultra-low power processing system for a wireless sensor node for very low duty cycle applications. In the CoolBio system-on-chip, we utilized several power reduction techniques at both the architecture level and the circuit level. These techniques include feature extraction, voltage and frequency scaling, clock and power gating and a redesign of key standard cells. In the design of the ultra-low power processing system, we paid special attention to the memory subsystem, as it is one of the most power-consuming modules in a design. We also designed a clock manager in order to reduce the power consumed by clocking, and a power manager that is able to power-off unutilized modules. The proposed wireless sensor node processing system consumes 36.4Î¼W at 100MHz and 1.2V supply voltage, for a heartbeat-detection algorithm with a 0.01&percnt; duty cycle."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13243","fieldValue":"ECG"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13243","fieldValue":"WSN"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13244","fieldValue":" This article presents a formal specification and validation environment to prove safety and liveness properties of parametric -- unbounded -- NoCs architectures described at a high-level of abstraction. The environment improves the GeNoC approach with two new theorems, proving evacuation and starvation freedom. The application of the validation methodology is illustrated on a HERMES NoC with adaptive west-first routing and wormhole switching. This case study illustrates the strong compositional aspect of the GeNoC environment. The complete specification of this HERMES instance, together with the proof that the specification is deadlock-free, starvation free, and all messages eventually leave the network at their correct destination, could be achieved in about a week. Approximately 86&percnt; of this proof is automatically derived from the GeNoC model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13245","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks (WSN) is a new and very challenging research field for embedded system design automation. Engineering a WSN node hardware platform is known to be a tough challenge, as the design must enforce many severe constraints, among which energy dissipation is by far the most important one. WSN node devices have until now been designed using off-the-shelf low-power microcontroller units (MCUs), even if their power dissipation is still an issue and hinders the widespread use of this new technology. In this work, we propose a complete system-level flow for an alternative approach based on the concept of hardware microtasks, which relies on hardware specialization and power gating to drastically improve the energy efficiency of the computational\/control part of the node. Our case study shows that power savings between one to two orders of magnitude are possible w.r.t. MCU-based implementations."}
