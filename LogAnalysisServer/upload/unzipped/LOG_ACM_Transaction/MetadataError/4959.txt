{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3587","fieldValue":" Nonlinear audio system identification generally relies on Gaussianity, whiteness and stationarity hypothesis on the input signal, although audio signals are non-Gaussian, highly correlated and non-stationary. However, since the physical behavior of nonlinear audio systems is input-dependent, they should be identified using natural audio signals (speech or music) as input, instead of artificial signals (sweeps or noise) as usually done. We propose an identification scheme that conditions audio signals to fit the desired properties for an efficient identification. The identification system consists in (1) a Gaussianization step that makes the signal near-Gaussian under a perceptual constraint; (2) a predictor filterbank that whitens the signal; (3) an orthonormalization step that enhances the statistical properties of the input vector of the last step, under a Gaussianity hypothesis; (4) an adaptive nonlinear model. The proposed scheme enhances the convergence rate of the identification and reduces the steady state identification error, compared to other schemes, for example the classical adaptive nonlinear identification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3587","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3587","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3588","fieldValue":" In this article, we address speech reinforcement (near-end listening enhancement) for a scenario where there are several playback zones. In such a framework, signals from one zone can leak into other zones (crosstalk), causing intelligibility and\/or quality degradation. An optimization framework is built by exploring a signal model where effects of noise, reverberation and zone crosstalk are taken into account simultaneously. Through the symbolic usage of a general smooth distortion measure, necessary optimality conditions are derived in terms of distortion measure gradients and the signal model. Subsequently, as an illustrative example of the framework, the conditions are applied for the mean-square error (MSE) expected distortion under a hybrid stochastic-deterministic model for the corruptions. A crosstalk cancellation algorithm follows, which depends on diffuse reverberation and across zone direct path components. Simulations validate the optimality of the algorithm and show a clear benefit in multizone processing, as opposed to the iterated application of a single-zone algorithm. Also, comparisons with least-squares crosstalk cancellers in literature show the profit of using a hybrid model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3588","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3588","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3589","fieldValue":"Chao Pan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3589","fieldValue":"Jingdong Chen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3589","fieldValue":" Linear microphone arrays combined with the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer have been widely studied in various applications to acquire desired signals and reduce the unwanted noise. Most of the existing array systems assume that the desired sources are in the broadside direction. In this paper, we study and analyze the performance of the MVDR beamformer as a function of the source incidence angle. Using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and beampattern as the criteria, we investigate its performance in four different scenarios: spatially white noise, diffuse noise, diffuse-plus-white noise, and point-source-plus-white noise. The results demonstrate that the optimal performance of the MVDR beamformer occurs when the source is in the endfire directions for diffuse noise and point-source noise while its SNR gain does not depend on the signal incidence angle in spatially white noise. This indicates that most current systems may not fully exploit the potential of the MVDR beamformer. This analysis does not only help us better understand this algorithm, but also helps us design better array systems for practical applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3589","fieldValue":"ACM"}
