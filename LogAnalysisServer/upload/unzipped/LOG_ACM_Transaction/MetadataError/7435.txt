Our approach aims at maximizing network efficiency by taking into account the inter-AP domain interference and the access mechanism. Both the single-channel and the multiple-channel WLAN planning problems are considered. We give different formulations which capture at different levels of detail the effect of interference on the network efficiency. In order to evaluate the quality of the proposed models, we obtain the optimal solutions for synthetic network instances, and propose heuristics to get suboptimal solutions in a reasonable computing time. We show that the networks planned according to our approach feature higher efficiency than the ones planned using classical models, like the minimum-cardinality set covering problem (SCP), by privileging network solutions with low-power APs installed. The achieved gain reaches 167% in particular network scenarios. Moreover, we test the obtained solutions through simulation and real-life testbed implementation; both analyses show that the networks planned with the proposed approaches are the ones with the highest saturation throughput with respect to those configurations obtained with SCP."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9680","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9680","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9680","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1875","fieldValue":"Cazorla, Francisco J"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1875","fieldValue":" Accurately determining the energy consumed by each task in a system will become of prominent importance in future multicore-based systems because it offers several benefits, including (i) better application energy\/performance optimizations, (ii) improved energy-aware task scheduling, and (iii) energy-aware billing in data centers. Unfortunately, existing methods for energy metering in multicores fail to provide accurate energy estimates for each task when several tasks run simultaneously. This article makes a case for accurate Per-Task Energy Metering (PTEM) based on tracking the resource utilization and occupancy of each task. Different hardware implementations with different trade-offs between energy prediction accuracy and hardware-implementation complexity are proposed. Our evaluation shows that the energy consumed in a multicore by each task can be accurately measured. For a 32-core, 2-way, simultaneous multithreaded core setup, PTEM reduces the average accuracy error from more than 12&percnt; when our hardware support is not used to less than 4&percnt; when it is used. The maximum observed error for any task in the workload we used reduces from 58&percnt; down to 9&percnt; when our hardware support is used."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9681","fieldValue":" Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide secure and reliable communication between customer sites. With the increase in number and size of VPNs, providers need efficient provisioning techniques that adapt to customer demand by leveraging a good understanding of VPN properties. In this paper, we analyze two important properties of VPNs that impact provisioning: 1) structure of customer endpoint (CE) interactions and 2) temporal characteristics of CE-CE traffic. We deduce these properties by computing traffic matrices from SNMP measurements. We find that existing traffic matrix estimation techniques are not readily applicable to the VPN scenario due to the scale of the problem and limited measurement information. We begin by formulating a scalable technique that makes the most out of existing measurement information and provides good estimates for common VPN structures. We then use this technique to analyze SNMP measurement information from a large IP VPN service provider. We find that even with limited measurement information (no per-VPN data for the core) we can estimate traffic matrices for a significant fraction of VPNs, namely, those constituting the \"Huband-Spoke\" category. In addition, the ability to infer the structure of VPNs holds special significance for provisioning tasks arising from topology changes, link failures and maintenance. We are able to provide a classification of VPNs by structure and identify CEs that act as hubs of communication and hence require prioritized treatment during restoration and provisioning."}
