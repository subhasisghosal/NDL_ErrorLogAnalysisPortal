Level 2 BLAS are targeted at matrix-vector operations with the aim of providing more efficient, but portable, implementations of algorithms on high-performance computers. The model implementation provides a portable set of FORTRAN 77 Level 2 BLAS for machines where specialized implementations do not exist or are not required. The test software aims to verify that specialized implementations meet the specification of Level 2 BLAS and that implementations are correctly installed."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18562","fieldValue":"Algorithm 656: an extended set of basic linear algebra subprograms: model implementation and test programs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18562","fieldValue":"ACM"}
