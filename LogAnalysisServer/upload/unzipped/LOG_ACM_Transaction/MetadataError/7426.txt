However, in order to satisfy a connection's service-availability requirement in a cost-effective and resource-efficient manner, we need a systematic mechanism to select a proper protection scheme for each connection request while provisioning the connection. In this paper, we propose to use connection availability as a metric to provide differentiated protection services in a wavelength-convertible WDM mesh network. We develop a mathematical model to analyze the availabilities of connections with different protection modes (i.e., unprotected, dedicated protected, or shared protected). In the shared-protection case, we investigate how a connection's availability is affected by backup resource sharing. The sharing might cause backup resource contention between several connections when multiple simultaneous (or overlapping) failures occur in the network. Using a continuous-time Markov model, we derive the conditional probability for a connection to acquire backup resources in the presence of backup resource contention. Through this model, we show how the availability of a shared-protected connection can be quantitatively computed. Based on the analytical model, we develop provisioning strategies for a given set of connection demands in which an appropriate, possibly different, level of protection is provided to each connection according to its predefined availability requirement, e.g., 0.999, 0.997. We propose integer linear programming (ILP) and heuristic approaches to provision the connections cost effectively while satisfying the connections' availability requirements. The effectiveness of our provisioning approaches is demonstrated through numerical examples. The proposed provisioning strategies inherently facilitate the service differentiation in optical WDM mesh networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9662","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9662","fieldValue":"WDM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9662","fieldValue":"Availability-aware provisioning strategies for differentiated protection services in wavelength-convertible WDM mesh networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9662","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9662","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9663","fieldValue":" Switches with a shared buffer have lower packet loss probabilities than other types of switches when the sizes of the buffers are the same. In the past, the performance of shared buffer switches has been studied extensively. However, due to the strong dependencies of the output queues in the buffer, it is very difficult to find a good analytical model. Existing models are either accurate but have exponential complexities or not very accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel analytical model called the Aggregation model for switches with shared buffer. The model is based on the idea of induction: first find the behavior of two queues, then aggregate them into one block; then find the behavior of three queues while regarding two of the queues as one block, then aggregate the three queues into one block; then aggregate four queues, and so on. When all queues have been aggregated, the behavior of the entire switch will be found. This model has perfect accuracies under all tested conditions and has polynomial complexity."}
