It provides a simple characterization of the computation of this transformation and suggests an alternative algorithm for computing it. It also suggests an alternative transformation, the UT transform, with the same utility as the compact WY Transform which requires less computation and has similar stability properties. That alternative transformation was first published over a decade ago but has gone unnoticed by the community."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19131","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19131","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19132","fieldValue":"Quintana-Ort, Gregorio"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19132","fieldValue":"Geijn, Robert van de"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19132","fieldValue":" In this article, a modification of the blocked algorithm for reduction to Hessenberg form is presented that improves performance by shifting more computation from less efficient matrix-vector operations to highly efficient matrix-matrix operations.
