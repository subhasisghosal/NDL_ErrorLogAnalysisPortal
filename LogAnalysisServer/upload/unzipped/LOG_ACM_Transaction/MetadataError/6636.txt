In LBSNs, social and geographical influences have been intensively used in location recommendations. However, human movement also exhibits spatiotemporal sequential patterns, but only a few current studies consider the spatiotemporal sequential influence of locations on usersâ\u20AC™ check-in behaviors. In this article, we propose a new gravity model for location recommendations, called LORE, to exploit the spatiotemporal sequential influence on location recommendations. First, LORE extracts sequential patterns from historical check-in location sequences of all users as a Location-Location Transition Graph $(L^2TG), and utilizes the L2$TG to predict the probability of a user visiting a new location through the developed additive Markov chain that considers the effect of all visited locations in the check-in history of the user on the new location. Furthermore, LORE applies our contrived gravity model to weigh the effect of each visited location on the new location derived from the personalized attractive force (i.e., the weight) between the visited location and the new location. The gravity model effectively integrates the spatiotemporal, social, and popularity influences by estimating a power-law distribution based on (i) the spatial distance and temporal difference between two consecutive check-in locations of the same user, (ii) the check-in frequency of social friends, and (iii) the popularity of locations from all users. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for LORE using three large-scale real-world datasets collected from Foursquare, Gowalla, and Brightkite. Experimental results show that LORE achieves significantly superior location recommendations compared to other state-of-the-art location recommendation techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7669","fieldValue":" Along with the exponential growth of high-performance mobile devices, on-device Mobile Landmark Recognition (MLR) has recently attracted increasing research attention. However, the latency and accuracy of automatic recognition remain as bottlenecks against its real-world usage. In this article, we introduce a novel framework that combines interactive image segmentation with multifeature fusion to achieve improved MLR with high accuracy. First, we propose an effective vector binarization method to reduce the memory usage of image descriptors extracted on-device, which maintains comparable recognition accuracy to the original descriptors. Second, we design a location-aware fusion algorithm that can fuse multiple visual features into a compact yet discriminative image descriptor to improve on-device efficiency. Third, a user-friendly interaction scheme is developed that enables interactive foreground\/background segmentation to largely improve recognition accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for on-device MLR applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7669","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7669","fieldValue":"ACM"}
