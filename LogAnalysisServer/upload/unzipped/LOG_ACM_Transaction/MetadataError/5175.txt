The reverberant speech can be separated into two components, namely, an early speech component that consists of the direct path and some early reflections and a late reverberant component that consists of all late reflections. In this paper, a novel algorithm to simultaneously suppress early reflections, late reverberation, and ambient noise is presented. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the signals and spatial parameters of the early speech component and the late reverberation components. As a result, a spatially filtered version of the early speech component is estimated in the E-step. The power spectral density (PSD) of the anechoic speech, the relative early transfer functions, and the PSD matrix of the late reverberation are estimated in the M-step of the EM algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated using real room impulse response recorded in our acoustic lab with a reverberation time set to 0.36 s and 0.61 s and several signal-to-noise ratio levels. It is shown that significant improvement is obtained and that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline single-channel and multichannel dereverberation algorithms, as well as a state-of-the-art multichannel dereverberation algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4075","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4075","fieldValue":"An expectation-maximization algorithm for multimicrophone speech dereverberation and noise reduction with coherence matrix estimation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4075","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4075","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4076","fieldValue":"Delikaris-Manias, Symeon"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4076","fieldValue":" Spatial filtering with microphone arrays is a technique that can be utilized to obtain the signal of a target sound source from a specific direction. Typical approaches in the field of audio underperform in practical environments with multiple sound sources and diffuse sound. In this contribution, we propose a post-filtering technique to suppress the effect of interferers and diffuse sound. The proposed technique utilizes the cross-spectral estimates of the output of two beamformers to formulate a time-frequency soft masker. The beamformers' outputs are used only for parameter estimation and not for generating an audio signal. Two sets of beamformer weights, a constant and an adaptive, are applied to the microphone array signals for the parameter estimation. The weights of the constant beamformer are designed such that they provide a spatially narrow beam pattern that is time and frequency invariant, having a unity gain toward the direction of interest. The weights of the adaptive beamformer are formulated using linearly constrained optimization with the constraint of weighted orthogonality with respect to the constant beamformer weights, as well as the unity gain toward the look direction. The orthogonality constraint provides diffuse sound suppression while the unity gain distortionless response. The cross spectrum of these two beamformers provides the target energy at a given look direction for the post filter. The study focuses on compact microphone arrays with which the typical beamforming techniques feature a tradeoff between noise amplification and spatial selectivity, especially in the low frequency region. The proposed method is evaluated with instrumental measures and listening tests under different reverberation times, in dual and multitalker scenarios. The evaluation shows that the proposed method provides a better performance when compared with a previous state-of-the-art spatial filter based on cross-pattern coherence, a linearly constrained beamformer and a Wiener postfilter."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4076","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}
