Towards this end, we consider a discretization of the SDE over finite time instants and reformulate the problem as one of finding an optimal parameter at each of these instants. A stochastic approximation algorithm based on the smoothed functional technique is adapted to this setting for finding the optimal parameter trajectory. A proof of convergence of the algorithm is presented and results of numerical experiments over two different settings are shown. The algorithm is seen to exhibit good performance. We also present extensions of our framework to the case of finding optimal parameterized feedback policies for controlled SDE and present numerical results in this scenario as well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24976","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24976","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24977","fieldValue":"Nova, Accio M O Porta"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24977","fieldValue":" This article extends the use of classical autoregressive and moving average time-series models to the analysis of a variety of nonstationary discrete-event simulations. A thorough experimental evaluation shows that integrated and seasonal time-series models constitute very promising metamodels, especially for analyzing queueing system simulations under congested or cyclical traffic conditions. In some situations, stationarity-inducing transformations may be required before this methodology can be used. Our approach for efficient estimation of meaningful performance measures of selected responses in the target system is illustrated using a set of case studies taken from the simulation literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24978","fieldValue":" This article gives several methods for approximating a closed queueing network with a smaller one. The objective is to reduce the simulation time of the network. We consider Jackson-like networks with Markovian routing and with general service distributions. The basic idea is to first divide the network into two partsâ\u20AC\u201Dthe core nodes of interest and the remaining nodes. We suppose that only metrics at the core nodes are of interest. The remaining nodes are collapsed into a reduced set of nodes, in an effort to approximate the flows into and out of the set of core nodes. The core nodes and their interactions are preserved in the reduced network. We test the network reductions for accuracy and speed. By randomly generating sample networks, we test the reductions on a large variety of test networks, rather than on a few specific cases. The main conclusion is that the reductions work well when the squared coefficients of variation of the service distributions are not all small (that is, the network is not close to being deterministic) and for nodes where the utilization is not too high or too low."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24978","fieldValue":"ACM"}
