Our goal was to evaluate the performance and robustness of our recently developed commercial-grade CLIR systems for English and Asian languages. The main contribution of this article is the investigation of different strategies, their interactions in both monolingual and bilingual retrieval tasks, and their respective contributions to operational retrieval systems in the context of NTCIR-4. We report results of Japanese and English monolingual retrieval and results of Japanese-to-English bilingual retrieval. In monolingual retrieval analysis, we examine two special properties of the NTCIR experimental design (two levels of relevance and identical queries in multiple languages) and explore how they interact with strategies of our retrieval system, including pseudo-relevance feedback, multi-word term down-weighting, and term weight merging strategies. Our analysis shows that the choice of language (English or Japanese) does not have a significant impact on retrieval performance. Query expansion is slightly more effective with relaxed judgments than with rigid judgments. For better retrieval performance, weights of multi-word terms should be lowered. In the bilingual retrieval analysis, we aim to identify robust strategies that are effective when used alone and when used in combination with other strategies. We examine cross-lingual specific strategies such as translation disambiguation and translation structuring, as well as general strategies such as pseudo-relevance feedback and multi-word term down-weighting. For shorter title topics, pseudo-relevance feedback is a major performance enhancer, but translation structuring affects retrieval performance negatively when used alone or in combination with other strategies. All experimented strategies improve retrieval performance for the longer description topics, with pseudo-relevance feedback and translation structuring as the major contributors."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2873","fieldValue":"NTCIR"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2873","fieldValue":"Towards effective strategies for monolingual and bilingual information retrieval: Lessons learned from NTCIR-4"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2873","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2873","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19372","fieldValue":" The algorithm that computes the midpoint of an interval with floating-point bounds requires some careful devising to handle all possible inputs correctly. We review several implementations from prominent C\/C&plus;&plus; interval arithmetic packages and analyze their potential failure to deliver the expected results. We then show how to amend them to avoid common pitfalls. The results presented are also relevant to noninterval arithmetic computation such as the implementation of bisection methods. Enough background on IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic is provided for this article to serve as a practical introduction to the analysis of floating-point computation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19372","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19372","fieldValue":"ACM"}
