{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24370","fieldValue":" Web service discovery is one of the main applications of semantic Web services, which extend standard Web services with semantic annotations. Current discovery solutions were developed in the context of automatic service composition. Thus, the â\u20ACœclientâ\u20AC? of the discovery procedure is an automated computer program rather than a human, with little, if any, tolerance to inexact results. However, in the real world, services which might be semantically distanced from each other are glued together using manual coding. In this article, we propose a new retrieval model for semantic Web services, with the objective of simplifying service discovery for human users. The model relies on simple and extensible keyword-based query language and enables efficient retrieval of approximate results, including approximate service compositions. Since representing all possible compositions and all approximate concept references can result in an exponentially-sized index, we investigate clustering methods to provide a scalable mechanism for service indexing. Results of experiments, designed to evaluate our indexing and query methods, show that satisfactory approximate search is feasible with efficient processing time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24370","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24370","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24371","fieldValue":" This article proposes a model-driven methodology to design and develop semantic Web service applications and their components, described according to the emerging WSMO standard. In particular, we show that business processes and Web engineering models have sufficient expressive power to support the semiautomatic extraction of semantic descriptions (i.e., WSMO ontologies, goals, Web services, and mediators), thus partially hiding the complexity of dealing with semantics. Our method is based on existing models for the specification of business processes (BPMN) combined with Web engineering models for designing and developing semantically rich Web applications (WebML). The proposed approach leads from an abstract view of the business needs to a concrete implementation of the application by means of several design steps; high-level models are transformed into software components. Our framework increases the efficiency of the whole design process, yielding to the construction of semantic Web service applications spanning over several enterprises."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24371","fieldValue":"WSMO"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24371","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24371","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24372","fieldValue":" Web services composition is a keystone in the development of interoperable systems. However, despite the widespread adoption of Web services, several obstacles still hinder their smooth automatic semantic reconciliation when being composed. Consistent understanding of data exchanged between composed Web services is hampered by various implicit modeling assumptions and representations. Our contribution in this article revolves around context and how it enriches data exchange between Web services. In particular, a context-based mediation approach to solve semantic heterogeneities between composed Web services is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24372","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24372","fieldValue":"ACM"}
