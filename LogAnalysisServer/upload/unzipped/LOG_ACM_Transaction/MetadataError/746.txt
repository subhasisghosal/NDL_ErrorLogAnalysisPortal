We address the outstanding error control problems in the existing sampling-based reduction framework over a frequency band. Our new method, WBMOR, explicitly and efficiently computes the exact residual errors to guide the sampling process. We show by sampling along the imaginary axis and performing a new complex-valued reduction that the reduced model will match exactly with the original model at the sample points. Additionally, we show in theory that the proposed method can achieve the error bound over a given frequency range. In practice, the new algorithm can help designers choose the best order of the reduced model for the given frequency range and error bound via the adaptive sampling scheme. In addition, WBMOR can perform wideband accurate reductions of interconnect circuits for analog and RF applications where model accuracy needs to be maintained over a wide frequency range. We compare several sampling schemes such as Monte Carlo, logarithmic, recently proposed resampling, and ARMS methods. Experimental results on a number of RLC circuits show that WBMOR is much more efficient than all the other sampling methods, including the recently proposed resampling and ARMS schemes with the same reduction orders. Compared with the traditional real-valued sampling methods, the complex-valued sampling method is more accurate for the same computational cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13248","fieldValue":"Compact Modeling of Interconnect Circuits over Wide Frequency Band by Adaptive Complex-Valued Sampling Method"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13248","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13248","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13249","fieldValue":"Lin, Jing-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13249","fieldValue":"Ho, Tsung-Yi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13249","fieldValue":"Jiang, Iris Hui-Ru"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13249","fieldValue":" Electromigration and voltage drop (IR-drop) are two major reliability issues in modern IC design. Electromigration gradually creates permanently open or short circuits due to excessive current densities; IR-drop causes insufficient power supply, thus degrading performance or even inducing functional errors because of nonzero wire resistance. Both types of failure can be triggered by insufficient wire widths. Although expanding the wire width alleviates electromigration and IR-drop, unlimited expansion not only increases the routing cost, but may also be infeasible due to the limited routing resource. In addition, electromigration and IR-drop manifest mainly in the power\/ground (P\/G) network. Therefore, taking wire widths into consideration is desirable to prevent electromigration and IR-drop at P\/G routing. Unlike mature digital IC designs, P\/G routing in analog ICs has not yet been well studied. In a conventional design, analog designers manually route P\/G networks by implementing greedy strategies. However, the growing scale of analog ICs renders manual routing inefficient, and the greedy strategies may be ineffective when electromigration and IR-drop are considered. This study distances itself from conventional manual design and proposes an automatic analog P\/G router that considers electromigration and IR-drops. First, employing transportation formulation, this article constructs an electromigration-aware rectilinear Steiner tree with the minimum routing cost. Second, without changing the solution quality, wires are bundled to release routing space for enhancing routability and relaxing congestion. A wire width extension method is subsequently adopted to reduce wire resistance for IR-drop safety. Compared with high-tech designs, the proposed approach achieves equally optimal solutions for electromigration avoidance, with superior efficiencies. Furthermore, via industrial design, experimental results also show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for electromigration prevention and IR-drop reduction."}
