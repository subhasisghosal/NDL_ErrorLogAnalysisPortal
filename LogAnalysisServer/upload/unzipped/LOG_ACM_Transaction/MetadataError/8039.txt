{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10896","fieldValue":" Motivated by applications in data centers, we consider a scenario where multiple classes of requests arrive at a dispatcher at time-varying rates which historically has daily or weekly patterns. We assume that the underlying environment is such that at all times the load from each class is very high and a large number of servers are necessary which, for example, is fairly common in many data centers. In addition, each server can host one or more classes. Design, control and performance analysis under such heterogeneous and transient conditions is extremely difficult. To address this shortcoming we have suggested a holistic approach that includes a combination of sizing, assignment, and routing in an integrated fashion. Our proposed approach decomposes a multidimensional and non-stationary problem into a one-dimensional, simpler and stationary one, and achieves time-stability by introducing an insignificant number of dummy requests. Based on time-stability, our suggested approach can provide performance bounds and guarantees for time-varying and transient system. Moreover, we can operate the data centers in an energy-efficient manner via suggested approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10896","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10896","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10896","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10896","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10897","fieldValue":" We develop approaches for disjoint multipath routing and fast recovery in IP networks that guarantee recovery from arbitrary two link failures. We achieve this by developing the first known algorithm to construct three edge-independent spanning trees, which has a running time complexity of. The property of these trees is that the paths from a source to the destination on the trees are mutually link-disjoint. We illustrate how the three edge-independent trees rooted at a destination may be employed to achieve multipath routing and IP fast recovery. We discuss different ways of employing the trees. The routing of packets is based on the destination address and the input interface over which the packet was received. If the trees are employed exclusively for multipath routing, then no packet overhead is required. If the trees are employed for failure recovery, then the overhead bits will range from 0 to 2 bits depending on the flexibility sought in routing. We evaluate the performance of the trees in fast recovery by comparing the path lengths provided under single- and dual-link failures with an earlier approach based on tunneling. We also evaluate the performance of the trees when used for multipath routing and compare it to equal-cost multipaths (ECMP)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10897","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10897","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10897","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10897","fieldValue":"ACM"}
