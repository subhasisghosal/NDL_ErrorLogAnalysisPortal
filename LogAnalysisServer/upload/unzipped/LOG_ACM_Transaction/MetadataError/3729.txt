Nevertheless, we argue that other marketing factors, such as social influence, could be considered in the process of business-location planning. In this article, we propose a framework for business-location planning that takes into account both factors of geographical proximity and social influence. An essential task in this framework is to compute the â\u20ACœinfluence spreadâ\u20AC? of RNNs for candidate locations. Here, the influence spread refers to the number of people influenced via the word-of-mouth effect. To alleviate the excessive computational overhead and long latency in the framework, we trade storage overhead for processing speed by precomputing and storing the social influence between pairs of customers. Based on Targeted Region (TR)-Oriented and RNN-Oriented processing strategies, we develop two suites of algorithms that incorporate various efficient pruning and segmentation techniques to enhance our framework. Experiments validate our ideas and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms over various parameter settings. The experimental results show that (a) TR-oriented and RNN-oriented processing are feasible for supporting the task of location planning; (b) RNN-oriented processing is more efficient than TR-oriented processing; and (c) the optimization technique that we developed significantly improves the efficiency of RNN-oriented and TR-oriented processing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21989","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21989","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3102","fieldValue":" In the Thai language, tone information is necessary for Thai speech recognition systems. Previous studies show that many acoustic cues are attributed to shapes of tones. Nevertheless, most Thai tone classification studies mainly adopted $F_0$ values and their derivatives without considering other acoustic features. In this article, other acoustic features for Thai tone classification are investigated. In the experiment, energy values and spectral information represented by three spectral-based features including the LPC-based feature, PLP-based feature, and MFCC-based feature are applied to the HCRF-based Thai tone classification, which was reported as the best approach for Thai tone classification. The energy values provide an error rate reduction of 22.40&percnt; in the isolated word scenario, while there are slight improvements in the continuous speech scenario. On the contrary, spectral-based features greatly contribute to Thai tone classification in the continuous-speech scenario, whereas spectral-based features slightly degrade performances in the isolated-word scenario. The best achievement in the continuous-speech scenario is obtained from the PLP-based feature, which yields an error rate reduction of 13.90&percnt;. Therefore, findings in this article are that energy values and spectral-based features, especially the PLP-based feature, are the main contributors to the improvement of the performances of Thai tone classification in the isolated-word scenario and the continuous-speech scenario, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3102","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3102","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21990","fieldValue":"Dijk, Thomas C Van"}
