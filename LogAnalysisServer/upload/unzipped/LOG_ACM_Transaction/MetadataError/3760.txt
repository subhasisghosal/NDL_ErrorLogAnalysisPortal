Authorization decisions are needed in electronic commerce, mobile-code execution, remote resource sharing, privacy protection, and many other applications. We adopt the trust-management approach, in which \"authorization\" is viewed as a \"proof-of-compliance\" problem: Does a set of credentials prove that a request complies with a policy?We develop a logic-based language, called Delegation Logic (DL), to represent policies, credentials, and requests in distributed authorization. In this paper, we describe D1LP, the monotonic version of DL. D1LP extends the logic-programming (LP) language Datalog with expressive delegation constructs that feature delegation depth and a wide variety of complex principals (including, but not limited to, k-out-of-n thresholds). Our approach to defining and implementing D1LP is based on tractably compiling D1LP programs into ordinary logic programs (OLPs). This compilation approach enables D1LP to be implemented modularly on top of existing technologies for OLP, for example, Prolog.As a trust-management language, D1LP provides a concept of proof-of-compliance that is founded on well-understood principles of logic programming and knowledge representation. D1LP also provides a logical framework for studying delegation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22148","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22148","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1230","fieldValue":" Pervasive adaptive systems are concerned with the construction of â\u20ACœsmartâ\u20AC? technologies capable of adapting to the needs of the individual in real time. In order to achieve this level of specificity, systems must be capable of monitoring the psychological status of the user and responding to these changes in real time and across multiple systems if necessary. This article describes a number of conceptual issues associated with this category of adaptive technology. The biocybernetic loop describes different approaches to monitoring the status of the user from physiological sensors to overt behavior. These data are used to drive real time system adaptation tailored to a specific user in a particular context. The rate at which the technology adapts to the individual user are described over three different phases of usage: awareness (short-term), adjustment (medium-term), and coevolution (long-term). An ontology is then proposed for the development of an adaptive software architecture that embodies this approach and may be extended to encompass several distinct loops working in parallel. The feasibility of the approach is assessed through implemented case studies of their performance and functionality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3112","fieldValue":"Dai, Xin-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3112","fieldValue":" Neural network language models (LMs) are shown to be effective in improving the performance of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. However, state-of-the-art neural network LMs usually use words before the current position as context and neglect global topic information, which can help machine translation (MT) systems to select better translation candidates from a higher perspective. In this work, we propose improvement of the state-of-the-art feedforward neural language model with topic information. Two main issues need to be tackled when adding topics into neural network LMs for SMT: one is how to incorporate topics to the neural network; the other is how to get target-side topic distribution before translation. We incorporate topics by appending topic distribution to the input layer of a feedforward LM. We adopt a multinomial logistic-regression (MLR) model to predict the target-side topic distribution based on source side information. Moreover, we propose a feedforward neural network model to learn joint representations on the source side for topic prediction. LM experiments demonstrate that the perplexity on validation set can be greatly reduced by the topic-enhanced feedforward LM, and the prediction of target-side topics can be improved dramatically with the MLR model equipped with the joint source representations. A final MT experiment, conducted on a large-scale Chinese--English dataset, shows that our feedforward LM with predicted topics improves the translation performance against a strong baseline."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3112","fieldValue":"ACM"}
