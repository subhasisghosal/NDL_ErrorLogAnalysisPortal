{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23919","fieldValue":" Web-search queries are typically short and ambiguous. To classify these queries into certain target categories is a difficult but important problem. In this article, we present a new technique called query enrichment, which takes a short query and maps it to intermediate objects. Based on the collected intermediate objects, the query is then mapped to target categories. To build the necessary mapping functions, we use an ensemble of search engines to produce an enrichment of the queries. Our technique was applied to the ACM Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining competition (ACM KDDCUP) in 2005, where we won the championship on all three evaluation metrics (precision, F1 measure, which combines precision and recall, and creativity, which is judged by the organizers) among a total of 33 teams worldwide. In this article, we show that, despite the difficulty of an abundance of ambiguous queries and lack of training data, our query-enrichment technique can solve the problem satisfactorily through a two-phase classification framework. We present a detailed description of our algorithm and experimental evaluation. Our best result for F1 and precision is 42.4&percnt; and 44.4&percnt;, respectively, which is 9.6&percnt; and 24.3&percnt; higher than those from the runner-ups, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23920","fieldValue":"Tsai, Chih-Fong"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23920","fieldValue":"McGarry, Ken"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23920","fieldValue":" Many users of image retrieval systems would prefer to express initial queries using keywords. However, manual keyword indexing is very time-consuming. Therefore, a content-based image retrieval system which can automatically assign keywords to images would be very attractive. Unfortunately, it has proved very challenging to build such systems, except where either the image domain is restricted or the keywords relate only to low-level concepts such as color. This article presents a novel image indexing and classification system, called CLAIRE (CLAssifying Images for REtrieval), composed of one image processing module and three modules of support vector machines for color, texture, and high-level concept classification for keyword assignment. The experimental prototype system described here assigns up to five keywords selected from a controlled vocabulary of 60 terms to each image. The system is trained offline by 1639 examples from the Corel stock photo library. For evaluation, five judges reviewed a sample of 800 unknown images to identify which automatically assigned keywords were actually relevant to the image. The system proved to have an 80&percnt; probability to assign at least one relevant keyword to an image."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23920","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23920","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23921","fieldValue":" Abbreviations and acronyms are widely used in the biomedical literature and many of them represent important biomedical concepts. Because many abbreviations are ambiguous (e.g., CAT denotes both chloramphenicol acetyl transferase and computed axial tomography, depending on the context), recognizing the full form associated with each abbreviation is in most cases equivalent to identifying the meaning of the abbreviation. This, in turn, allows us to perform more accurate natural language processing, information extraction, and retrieval. In this study, we have developed supervised approaches to identifying the full forms of ambiguous abbreviations within the context they appear. We first automatically assigned multiple possible full forms for each abbreviation; we then treated the in-context full-form prediction for each specific abbreviation occurrence as a case of word-sense disambiguation. We generated automatically a dictionary of all possible full forms for each abbreviation. We applied supervised machine-learning algorithms for disambiguation. Because some of the links between abbreviations and their corresponding full forms are explicitly given in the text and can be recovered automatically, we can use these explicit links to automatically provide training data for disambiguating the abbreviations that are not linked to a full form within a text. We evaluated our methods on over 150 thousand abstracts and obtain for coverage and precision results of 82&percnt; and 92&percnt;, respectively, when performed as tenfold cross-validation, and 79&percnt; and 80&percnt;, respectively, when evaluated against an external set of abstracts in which the abbreviations are not defined."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23921","fieldValue":"ACM"}
