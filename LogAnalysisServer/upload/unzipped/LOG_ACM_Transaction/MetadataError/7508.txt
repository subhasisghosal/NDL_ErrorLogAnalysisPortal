{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9824","fieldValue":" The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol is currently being developed as the base protocol compo-nent in the IETF Next Steps In Signaling (NSIS) protocol stack to support a variety of signaling applications. We present our study on the protocol overhead and performance aspects of GIST. We quantify network-layer protocol overhead and observe the effects of enhanced modularity and security in GIST. We developed a first open source GIST implementation at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, and study its performance in a Linux testbed. A GIST node serving 45 000 signaling sessions is found to consume average only 1.1 ms for processing a signaling message and 2.4 KB of memory for managing a session. Individual routines in the GIST code are instrumented to obtain a detailed profile of their contributions to the overall system processing. Important factors in determining performance, such as the number of sessions, state management, refresh frequency, timer management and signaling message size are further discussed. We investigate several mechanisms to improve GIST performance so that it is comparable to an RSVP implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9824","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9824","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9824","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9825","fieldValue":"von Rickenbach, Pascal"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9825","fieldValue":" Among the most critical issues of wireless ad hoc and sensor networks are energy consumption in general and interfer-ence in particular. The reduction of interference is consequently considered one of the foremost goals of topology control. Almost all of the related work however considers this issue implicitly: Low interference is often claimed to be a consequence of sparseness or low degree of the constructed topologies. This paper, in contrast, studies explicit definitions of interference. Various models of in-terference--both from a sender-centric and a receiver-centric per-spective--are proposed, compared, and analyzed with respect to their algorithmic properties and complexities."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9825","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9825","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9825","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9826","fieldValue":"Ng, T.
