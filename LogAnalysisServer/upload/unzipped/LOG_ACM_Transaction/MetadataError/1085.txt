In this article, we extend previous work by Kornatzky and Shimony to develop an algebra to handle object bases with uncertainty. We propose concepts of consistency for such object bases, together with an NP-completeness result, and classes of probabilistic object bases for which consistency is polynomially checkable. In addition, as certain operations involve conjunctions and disjunctions of events, and as the probability of conjunctive and disjunctive events depends both on the probabilities of the primitive events involved as well as on what is known (if anything) about the relationship between the events, we show how all our algebraic operations may be performed under arbitrary probabilistic conjunction and disjunction strategies. We also develop a host of equivalence results in our algebra, which may be used as rewrite rules for query optimization. Last but not least, we have developed a prototype probabilistic object base server on top of ObjectStore. We describe experiments to assess the efficiency of different possible rewrite rules."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14289","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14289","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14290","fieldValue":" In information-integration systems, sources may have diverse and limited query capabilities. To obtain maximum information from these restrictive sources to answer a query, one can access sources that are not specified in the query (i.e., off-query sources). In this article, we propose a query-planning framework to answer queries in the presence of limited access patterns. In the framework, a query and source descriptions are translated to a recursive datalog program. We then solve optimization problems in this framework, including how to decide whether accessing off-query sources is necessary, how to choose useful sources for a query, and how to test query containment. We develop algorithms to solve these problems, and thus construct an efficient program to answer a query."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14291","fieldValue":" We extend the relational data model to incorporate partial orderings into data domains, which we call the ordered relational model. Within the extended model, we define the partially ordered relational algebra (the PORA) by allowing the ordering predicate &sqsube; to be used in formulae of the selection operator (Ïƒ). The PORA expresses exactly the set of all possible relations that are invariant under order-preserving automorphism of databases. This result characterizes the expressiveness of the PORA and justifies the development of Ordered SQL (OSQL) as a query language for ordered databases. OSQL provides users with the capability of capturing the semantics of ordered data in many advanced applications, such as those having temporal or incomplete information. Ordered functional dependencies (OFDs) on ordered databases are studied, based on two possible extensions of domain orderings: pointwise ordering and lexicographical ordering. We present a sound and complete axiom system for OFDs in the first case and establish a set of sound and complete chase rules for OFDs in the second. Our results suggest that the implication problems for both cases of OFDs are decidable and that the enforcement of OFDs in ordered relations are practically feasible. In a wider perspective, the proposed model explores an important area of object-relational databases, since ordered domains can be viewed as a general kind of data type."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14291","fieldValue":"ACM"}
