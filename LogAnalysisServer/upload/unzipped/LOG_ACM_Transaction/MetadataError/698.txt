This article presents a platform-based resource binding approach based on a Distributed Register-File Microarchitecture (DRFM), which makes efficient use of distributed embedded memory blocks as register files in modern FPGAs. DRFM contains multiple islands, each having a local register file, a functional unit pool, and data-routing logic. Compared to the traditional discrete-register counterpart, a DRFM allows use of the platform-featured on-chip memory or register-file IP blocks to implement its local register files, and this results in a substantial saving of multiplexing logic and global interconnects. DRFM provides a useful architectural template and a direct optimization objective for minimizing interisland connections for synthesis algorithms. Given the scheduling solution and resource (functional units) constraints, two novel algorithms in the resource binding stage are developed based on DRFM: (i) a simultaneous DRFM clustering and binding algorithm, which decides the configuration of DRFM and the assignment of operations into islands with the focus on optimizing global connections; (ii) a data-forwarding scheduling algorithm, which takes advantage of the operation slacks to handle the read-port restriction of register files. On the Xilinx Virtex4 FPGA platform, experimental results with a set of real-life test cases show a 50&percnt; logic area reduction achieved by applying our approach, with a 14.6&percnt; performance improvement, compared to the traditional discrete-register-based approach. Also, experiments on small-size designs show that our algorithm produces the same number of total connections and at most one more maximum feeding-in connection compared to optimal solutions generated by ILP."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13138","fieldValue":"Simultaneous resource binding and interconnection optimization based on a distributed register-file microarchitecture"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13138","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13138","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13139","fieldValue":" Modern mobile devices need to be extremely energy efficient. Due to the growing complexity of these devices, energy-aware design exploration has become increasingly important. Current exploration tools often do not support energy estimation, or require the design to be very detailed before estimation is possible. It is important to get early feedback on both performance and energy consumption during all phases of the design and at higher abstraction levels. This article presents a unified optimization and exploration framework to explore source-level transformation to processor architecture design space. The proposed retargetable compiler and simulator framework can map applications to a range of processors and memory configurations, simulate, and report detailed performance and energy estimates. An accurate and consistent energy modeling approach is introduced which can estimate the energy consumption of processor and memories at a component level, which can help to guide the design process. Fast energy-aware architecture exploration is illustrated by modeling both state-of-the-art processors as well as other architectures. Various design trade-offs are also illustrated on different academic as well as industrial benchmarks from both the wireless communication and multimedia domain. We also illustrate a design space exploration on different applications and show that there is large trade-off space between application performance, energy consumption, and area. We show that the proposed framework is consistent, accurate, and covers a large design space including various novel low-power extensions in a unified framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13139","fieldValue":"VLIW"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13139","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13139","fieldValue":"ACM"}
