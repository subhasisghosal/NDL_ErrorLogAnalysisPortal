{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24729","fieldValue":" Optimistically synchronized parallel discrete-event simulation is based on the use of communicating sequential processes. Optimistic synchronization means that the processes proceed under the assumption that a synchronized execution schedule is fortuitous. Periodic checkpointing of the state of a process allows the process to roll back to an earlier state when synchronization errors are detected. This article examines the effects of varying the checkpoint interval on the execution time and memory space needed to perform a parallel simulation.The empirical results presented in this article were obtained from the simulation of closed stochastic queuing networks with several different topologies. Various intraprocessor process-scheduling algorithms and both lazy and aggressive cancellation strategies are considered. The empirical results are compared with analytical formulae predicting time-optimal checkpoint intervals. Two modes of operation, throttling and thrashing, have been noted and their effect examined. As the checkpoint interval is increased from one, there is a throttling effect among processes on the same processor, which improves performance. When the checkpoint interval is made too large, there is a thrashing effect caused by interaction between processes on different processors. It is shown that the time-optimal and space-optimal checkpoint intervals are not the same. Furthermore, a checkpoint interval that is too small affects space adversely more than time, whereas, a checkpoint interval that is too large affects time adversely more than space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24729","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24729","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3389","fieldValue":" This article reports on experiments about haptic perception aimed at measuring the force\/torque differential thresholds applied to the hand-arm system. The experimental work analyzes how force is sent back to the user by means of a 6 degrees-of-freedom haptic device. Our findings on force perception indicate that the just-noticeable-difference is generally higher than previously reported in the literature and not constant along the stimulus continuum. We found evidence that the thresholds change also among the different directions. Furthermore, asymmetries in force perceptions, which were not described in previous reports, can be evinced for most of the directions. These findings support our claim that human beings perceive forces differently along different directions, thus suggesting that perception can also be enhanced by suitable signal processing, that is, with a manipulation of the force signal before it reaches the haptic device. We think that the improvement of the user perception can have a great impact in many applications and in particular we are focusing on surgical teleoperation scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24730","fieldValue":" The twisted GFSR generators proposed in a previous article have a defect in k-distribution for k larger than the order of recurrence. In this follow up article, we introduce and analyze a new TGFSR variant having better k-distribution property. We provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the order of equidistribution, together with a tight upper bound on the order. We discuss a method to search for generators attaining this bound, and we list some of these such generators. The upper bound turns out to be (sometimes far) less than the maximum order of equidistribution for a generator of that period length, but far more than that for a GFSR with a working are of the same size."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/24730","fieldValue":"<italic>k<\/italic>-distribution"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24730","fieldValue":"<italic>k<\/italic>-distribution"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/24730","fieldValue":"<italic>m<\/italic>-sequences"}
