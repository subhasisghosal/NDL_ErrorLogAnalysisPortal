The generalized inverse has numerous important applications such as regression analysis, filtering, optimization and, more recently, linear associative memories. In this latter application known as Distributed Associative Memory, stimulus vectors are associated with response vectors and the result of many associations is spread over the entire memory matrix, which is calculated as the generalized inverse. Addition\/deletion of new associations requires recalculation of the generalized inverse, which becomes computationally costly for large systems. A better solution is to calculate the generalized inverse recursively. The proposed algorithm is a modification of the well known algorithm due to Rust et al. [2], originally introduced for nonrecursive computation. We compare our algorithm with Greville's recursive algorithm and conclude that our algorithm provides better numerical stability at the expense of little extra computation time and additional storage."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18677","fieldValue":" The software package PDECOL [7] is a popular code among scientists wishing to solve systems of nonlinear partial differential equations. The code is based on a method-of-lines approach, with collocation in the space variable to reduce the problem to a system of ordinary differential equations. There are three principal components: the basis functions employed in the collocation; the method used to solve the system of ordinary differential equations; and the linear equation solver which handles the linear algebra. This paper will concentrate on the third component, and will report on the improvement in the performance of PDECOL resulting from replacing the current linear algebra modules of the code by modules which take full advantage of the special structure of the equations which arise. Savings of over 50 percent in total execution time can be realized."}
