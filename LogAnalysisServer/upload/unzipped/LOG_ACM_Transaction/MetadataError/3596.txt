During routing, memory is required to store both architectural data and temporary routing data. The architectural data is static, and provides a representation of the physical routing resources and programmable connections on the device. We show that by taking advantage of the regularity in FPGAs, we can reduce the amount of information that must be explicitly represented, leading to significant memory savings. The temporary routing data is dynamic, and contains scoring parameters and traceback information for each routing resource in the FPGA. By studying the lifespan of the temporary routing data objects, we develop several memory management schemes to reduce this component. To make our proposals concrete, we applied them to the routing algorithm in VPR and empirically quantified the impact on runtime memory footprint, and place and route time."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21704","fieldValue":"CAD"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21704","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21704","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21704","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21705","fieldValue":"Xu, Ning-Yi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21705","fieldValue":"Cai, Xiong-Fei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21705","fieldValue":"Hsu, Feng-Hsiung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21705","fieldValue":" Search relevance is a key measurement for the usefulness of search engines. Shift of search relevance among search engines can easily change a search company's market cap by tens of billions of dollars. With the ever-increasing scale of the Web, machine learning technologies have become important tools to improve search relevance ranking. RankBoost is a promising algorithm in this area, but it is not widely used due to its long training time. To reduce the computation time for RankBoost, we designed a FPGA-based accelerator system and its upgraded version. The accelerator, plugged into a commodity PC, increased the training speed on MSN search engine data up to 1800x compared to the original software implementation on a server. The proposed accelerator has been successfully used by researchers in the search relevance ranking."}
