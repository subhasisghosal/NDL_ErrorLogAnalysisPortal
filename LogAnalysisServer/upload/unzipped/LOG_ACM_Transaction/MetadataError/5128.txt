Based on these, an audio identification algorithm is described that is robust to noise and severe time-frequency scale distortions and accurately identifies the underlying scale transform factors. The low number and compact representation of content features allows for efficient application of exact fixed-radius near-neighbor search methods for fingerprint matching in large audio collections. We demonstrate the practicability of the method on a collection of 100,000 songs, analyze its performance for a diverse set of noise as well as severe speed, tempo and pitch scale modifications, and identify a number of advantages of our method over two state-of-the-art distortion-robust audio identification algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3978","fieldValue":" Recursive neural network models have achieved promising results in many natural language processing tasks. The main difference among these models lies in the composition function, i.e., how to obtain the vector representation for a phrase or sentence using the representations of words it contains. This paper introduces a novel Adaptive Multi-Compositionality (AdaMC) layer to recursive neural network models. The basic idea is to use more than one composition function and adaptively select them depending on input vectors. We develop a general framework to model the semantic composition as a distribution of these composition functions. The composition functions and parameters used for adaptive selection are jointly learnt from the supervision of specific tasks. We integrate AdaMC into existing recursive neural network models and conduct extensive experiments on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and semantic relation classification task. The experimental results demonstrate that AdaMC improves the performance of recursive neural network models and outperforms the baseline methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3978","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3978","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3979","fieldValue":" Sentiment classification aims to determine the sentiment polarity expressed in a text. In online customer reviews, the sentiment polarities of words are usually dependent on the corresponding aspects. For instance, in mobile phone reviews, we may expect the long battery time but not enjoy the long response time of the operating system. Therefore, it is necessary and appealing to consider aspects when conducting sentiment classification. Probabilistic topic models that jointly detect aspects and sentiments have gained much success recently. However, most of the existing models are designed to work well in a language with rich resources. Directly applying those models on poor-quality corpora often leads to poor results. Consequently, a potential solution is to use the cross-lingual topic model to improve the sentiment classification for a target language by leveraging data and knowledge from a source language. However, the existing cross-lingual topic models are not suitable for sentiment classification because sentiment factors are not considered therein. To solve these problems, we propose for the first time a novel cross-lingual topic model framework which can be easily combined with the state-of-the-art aspect\/sentiment models. Extensive experiments in different domains and multiple languages demonstrate that our model can significantly improve the accuracy of sentiment classification in the target language."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3979","fieldValue":"ACM"}
