Aim: This study investigates the role of outcome feedback, that is, feedback about the discrepancy between the estimated and the actual effort, in improving the uncertainty assessments. Method: We conducted two in-depth empirical studies on uncertainty assessment learning. Study 1 included five student developers and Study 2, 10 software professionals. In each study the developers repeatedly assessed the uncertainty of their effort estimates of a programming task, solved the task, and received estimation accuracy outcome feedback. Results: We found that most, but not all, developers were initially over-confident in the accuracy of their effort estimates and remained over-confident in spite of repeated and timely outcome feedback. One important, but not sufficient, condition for improvement based on outcome feedback seems to be the use of explicitly formulated, instead of purely intuition-based, uncertainty assessment strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22767","fieldValue":"The role of outcome feedback in improving the uncertainty assessment of software development effort estimates"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22767","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22767","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22768","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22768","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22768","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22769","fieldValue":" Background. This article describes a case study on the benefits of software reuse in a large telecom product. The reused components were developed in-house and shared in a product-family approach. Methods. Quantitative data mined from company repositories are combined with other quantitative data and qualitative observations. Results. We observed significantly lower fault density and less modified code between successive releases of the reused components. Reuse and standardization of software architecture and processes allowed easier transfer of development when organizational changes happened. Conclusions. The study adds to the evidence of quality benefits of large-scale reuse programs and explores organizational motivations and outcomes."}
