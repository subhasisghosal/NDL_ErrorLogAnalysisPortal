In R2$BAC, in addition to a userâ\u20AC™s role memberships, the userâ\u20AC™s relationships with other users help determine whether the user is allowed to perform a certain step in a workflow. For example, a constraint may require that two steps must not be performed by users who have conflicts of interests. We study computational complexity of the workflow satisfiability problem, which asks whether a set of users can complete a workflow. In particular, we apply tools from parameterized complexity theory to better understand the complexities of this problem. Furthermore, we reduce the workflow satisfiability problem to SAT and apply SAT solvers to address the problem. Experiments show that our algorithm can solve instances of reasonable size efficiently. Finally, it is sometimes not enough to ensure that a workflow can be completed in normal situations. We study the resiliency problem in workflow authorization systems, which asks whether a workflow can be completed even if a number of users may be absent. We formally define three levels of resiliency in workflow systems and study computational problems related to these notions of resiliency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22316","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22316","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22317","fieldValue":"Ryan, Mark D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22317","fieldValue":" Anonymity with identity escrow attempts to allow users of an online service to remain anonymous, while providing the possibility that the service owner can break the anonymity in exceptional circumstances, such as to assist in a criminal investigation. In the article, we propose an identity escrow protocol that distributes user identity among several escrow agents. The main feature of our scheme is it is based on standard encryption algorithms and it provides user anonymity even if all but one escrow holders are dishonest acting in a coalition. We also present analysis of the anonymity property of our protocol in the applied pi-calculus. We review a related scheme by Marshall and Molina-Jiminez [2003] that aimed to achieve goals similar to ours, and show that their scheme suffers from serious weaknesses."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/22317","fieldValue":"Applied &pi;-calculus"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22317","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22317","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1232","fieldValue":" Resource pools are collections of computational resources (e.g., servers) which can be used by different applications in a shared way. A crucial aspect in these pools is to allocate resources so as to ensure their proper usage, taking into account workload and specific requirements of each application. An interesting approach, in this context, is to allocate the resources in the best possible way, aiming at optimal resource usage. Workload, however, varies over time, and in turn, resource demands will vary too. To ensure that optimal resource usage is always in place, resource shares should be defined dynamically and over time. It has been claimed that utility functions are the main tool for enabling such self-optimizing behavior. Whereas many solutions with this characteristic have been proposed to date, none of them presents true decentralization within the context of shared pools. In this article, we then propose a decentralized model for optimal resource usage in shared resource pools, providing practical and theoretical evidence of its feasibility."}
