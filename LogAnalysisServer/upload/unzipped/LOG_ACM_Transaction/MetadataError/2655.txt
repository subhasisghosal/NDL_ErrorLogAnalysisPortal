The triangulation covers the convex hull of the nodes, which need not be the entire surface, while the Voronoi diagram covers the entire surface. The package provides a wide range of capabilities including an efficient means of updating the triangulation with nodal additions or deletions. For N nodes, the storage requirement for the triangulation is 13N integer storage locations in addition to 3N nodal corrdinates. Using an off-line algorithm and work space of size 3N, the triangulation can be constructed with time complexity O(NlogN)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18895","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18895","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18896","fieldValue":" SSRFPACK is a Fortran 77 software package that constructs a smooth interpolatory or approximating surface to data values associated with arbitrarily distributed points on the surface of a sphere.
