In an optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) network, connection-oriented provisioning is commonly based on whether the path's statistical availability complies with the SLA-requested availability. Because of the stochastic nature of network failures, the actually provisioned availability over a specific time period is subject to uncertainty, and hence the SLA is usually at risk. We consider this uncertainty and study provisioning to minimize SLA violations. We show that the SLA Violation Risk is affected by a number of factors (e.g., failure profiles, availability target, and penalty period), and hence cannot simply be characterized by statistical path availability. We formulate the problem of risk-aware provisioning in WDM mesh networks, where path selection is dictated by SLA Violation Risk. In particular, we focus on devising an efficient scheme capable of computing path(s) that are likely to successfully accommodate the SLA-requested availability. A novel technique is applied to convert links with heterogeneous failure profiles to reference links that capture the main risk features in a relative manner. Based on the \"reference link\" concept, our Risk-Aware Provisioning scheme uses only limited failure information. We also extend our Risk-Aware Provisioning to use shared-path protection (SPP) for connections with strict availability requirements. We evaluate the performance and demonstrate the effectiveness of our schemes in terms of SLA violation ratio compared to the generic availability-aware approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10183","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10183","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10183","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8400","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10184","fieldValue":" In the past few years there has been vigorous debate regarding the size of buffers required at core Internet routers. Recent arguments supported by theory and experimentation show that under certain conditions, core router buffer sizes of a few tens of packets suffice for realizing acceptable end-to-end TCP throughputs. This is a significant step toward the realization of optical packet switched (OPS) networks, which are inherently limited in their ability to buffer optical signals. However, prior studies have largely ignored the presence of real-time traffic, which is increasing in importance as a source of revenue for Internet service providers. In this paper, we study the interaction that happens between real-time (open-loop) and TCP (closed-loop) traffic when they multiplex at buffers of very small size (few tens of packets) and make a significant discovery--namely that in a specific range of buffer size, real-time traffic losses increase as buffer size becomes larger. Our contributions pertaining to this anomalous behavior are threefold. First, we exhibit this anomalous loss performance for real-time traffic via extensive simulations using synthetic traffic and real video traces. Second, we develop quantitative models that reveal the dynamics of buffer sharing between real-time and TCP traffic that lead to this behavior. Third, we show how various factors such as the nature of real-time traffic, mixture of long-lived and short-lived TCP flows, and packet sizes impact the severity of the anomaly. Our study is the first to consider interactions between real-time and TCP traffic in very small (potentially all-optical) buffers and informs router manufacturers and network operators of the factors to consider when dimensioning such small buffer sizes for desired performance balance between real-time and TCP traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10184","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
