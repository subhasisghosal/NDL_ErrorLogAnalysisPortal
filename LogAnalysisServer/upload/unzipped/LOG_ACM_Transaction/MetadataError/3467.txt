We study coverage in naturally clustered networks of wireless sensor nodes, as opposed to WSNs where clustering is facilitated by selection. We show that along with increasing the vacancy in random placement of nodes in a WSN, it also alters the connectivity properties in the network. We analyze varying levels of redundancy to determine the probability of coverage in the network. The phenomenon of clustering in networks of wireless sensor nodes raises interesting questions for future research and development. The article provides a foundation for the design to optimize network performance with the constraint of sensing coverage."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21345","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21345","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21346","fieldValue":" Modeling the fundamental performance limits of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is of paramount importance to understand their behavior under the worst-case conditions and to make the appropriate design choices. This is particular relevant for time-sensitive WSN applications, where the timing behavior of the network protocols (message transmission must respect deadlines) impacts on the correct operation of these applications. In that direction this article contributes with a methodology based on Network Calculus, which enables quick and efficient worst-case dimensioning of static or even dynamically changing cluster-tree WSNs where the data sink can either be static or mobile. We propose closed-form recurrent expressions for computing the worst-case end-to-end delays, buffering and bandwidth requirements across any source-destination path in a cluster-tree WSN. We show how to apply our methodology to the case of IEEE 802.15.4\/ZigBee cluster-tree WSNs. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and analyze the accuracy of our methodology through a comprehensive experimental study using commercially available technology, namely TelosB motes running TinyOS."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21346","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21346","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21347","fieldValue":"Gun, tefan"}
