But most previous works focus on modeling only one type of usersâ\u20AC™ behaviors such as numerical ratings or browsing records, which are referred to as explicit feedback and implicit feedback, respectively. In this article, we study a Semisupervised Collaborative Recommendation (SSCR) problem with labeled feedback (for explicit feedback) and unlabeled feedback (for implicit feedback), in analogy to the well-known Semisupervised Learning (SSL) setting with labeled instances and unlabeled instances. SSCR is associated with two fundamental challenges, that is, heterogeneity of two types of usersâ\u20AC™ feedback and uncertainty of the unlabeled feedback. As a response, we design a novel Self-Transfer Learning (sTL) algorithm to iteratively identify and integrate likely positive unlabeled feedback, which is inspired by the general forward\/backward process in machine learning. The merit of sTL is its ability to learn usersâ\u20AC™ preferences from heterogeneous behaviors in a joint and selective manner. We conduct extensive empirical studies of sTL and several very competitive baselines on three large datasets. The experimental results show that our sTL is significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7246","fieldValue":" Several approaches have been researched to help people deal with abundance of information. An important feature pioneered by social tagging systems and later used in other kinds of social systems is the ability to explore different community relevance prospects by examining items bookmarked by a specific user or items associated by various users with a specific tag. A ranked list of recommended items offered by a specific recommender engine can be considered as another relevance prospect. The problem that we address is that existing personalized social systems do not allow their users to explore and combine multiple relevance prospects. Only one prospect can be explored at any given timeâ\u20AC\u201Da list of recommended items, a list of items bookmarked by a specific user, or a list of items marked with a specific tag. In this article, we explore the notion of combining multiple relevance prospects as a way to increase effectiveness and trust. We used a visual approach to recommend articles at a conference by explicitly presenting multiple dimensions of relevance. Suggestions offered by different recommendation techniques were embodied as recommender agents to put them on the same ground as users and tags. The results of two user studies performed at academic conferences allowed us to obtain interesting insights to enhance user interfaces of personalized social systems. More specifically, effectiveness and probability of item selection increase when users are able to explore and interrelate prospects of items relevanceâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, items bookmarked by users, recommendations and tags. Nevertheless, a less-technical audience may require guidance to understand the rationale of such intersections."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7247","fieldValue":" In the everyday world people form small conversing groups where social interaction takes place, and much of the social behavior takes place through managing interpersonal space (i.e., proxemics) and group formation, signaling their attentio to others (i.e., through gaze behavior), and expressing certain attitudes, for example, friendliness, by smiling, getting close through increased engagement and intimacy, and welcoming newcomers. Many real-time interactive systems feature virtual anthropomorphic characters in order to simulate conversing groups and add plausibility and believability to the simulated environments. However, only a few have dealt with autonomous behavior generation, and in those cases, the agentsâ\u20AC™ exhibited behavior should be evaluated by users in terms of appropriateness, believability, and conveyed meaning (e.g., attitudes). In this article we present an integrated intelligent interactive system for generating believable nonverbal behavior exhibited by virtual agents in small simulated group conversations. The produced behavior supports group formation management and the expression of interpersonal attitudes (friendly vs. unfriendly) both among the agents in the group (i.e., in-group attitude) and towards an approaching user in an avatar-based interaction (out-group attitude). A user study investigating the effects of these attitudes on usersâ\u20AC™ social presence evaluation and proxemics behavior (with their avatar) in a three-dimensional virtual city environment is presented. We divided the study into two trials according to the task assigned to users, that is, joining a conversing group and reaching a target destination behind the group. Results showed that the out-group attitude had a major impact on social presence evaluations in both trials, whereby friendly groups were perceived as more socially rich. The userâ\u20AC™s proxemics behavior depended on both out-group and in-group attitudes expressed by the agents. Implications of these results for the design and implementation of similar intelligent interactive systems for the autonomous generation of agentsâ\u20AC™ multimodal behavior are briefly discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7247","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7247","fieldValue":"ACM"}
