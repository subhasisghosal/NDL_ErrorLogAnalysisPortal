We achieve this by combining a two-dimensional stable fluid solver with an atlas of parametrizations of a Catmull-Clark surface. The contributions of this paper are: (i) an extension of the Stable Fluids solver to arbitrary curvilinear coordinates, (ii) an elegant method to handle cross-patch boundary conditions and (iii) a set of new external forces custom tailored for surface flows. Our techniques can also be generalized to handle other types of processes on surfaces modeled by partial differential equations, such as reaction-diffusion. Some of our simulations allow a user to interactively place densities and apply forces to the surface, then watch their effects in real-time. We have also computed higher resolution animations of surface flows off-line."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15359","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15359","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15360","fieldValue":" In computer graphics, most research focuses on creating images. However, there has been much recent work on the automatic generation of sound linked to objects in motion and the relative positions of receivers and sound sources. This paper proposes a new method for creating one type of sound called aerodynamic sound. Examples of aerodynamic sound include sound generated by swinging swords or by wind blowing. A major source of aerodynamic sound is vortices generated in fluids such as air. First, we propose a method for creating sound textures for aerodynamic sound by making use of computational fluid dynamics. Next, we propose a method using the sound textures for real-time rendering of aerodynamic sound according to the motion of objects or wind velocity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15360","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15360","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15361","fieldValue":" We describe a new technique for measuring the bidirectional texture function (BTF) of a surface that requires no mechanical movement, can measure surfaces in situ under arbitrary lighting conditions, and can be made small, portable and inexpensive. The enabling innovation is the use of a tapered kaleidoscope, which allows a camera to view the same surface sample simultaneously from many directions. Similarly, the surface can be simultaneously illuminated from many directions, using only a single structured light source. We describe the techniques of construction and measurement, and we show experimental results."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15361","fieldValue":"BRDF"}
