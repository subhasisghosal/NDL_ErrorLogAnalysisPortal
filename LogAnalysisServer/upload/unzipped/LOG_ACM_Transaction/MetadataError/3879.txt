{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22561","fieldValue":" A procedure for modeling software usage with the finite state, discrete parameter Markov chain is described. It involves rigorous analysis of the specification before design and coding begin. Many benefits emerge from this process, including the ability to synthesize a macro level usage distribution from a micro level understanding of how the software will be used. This usage distribution becomes the basis for a statistical test of the software, which is fundamental to the Cleanroom development process. Some analytical results known for Markov chains that have meaningful implications and interpretations for the software development process are described."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/3146","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"October 2012\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3185\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, October 2012\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"July 2012\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3184\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, July 2012\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"June 2012\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3183\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, June 2012\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"March 2012\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3182\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, March 2012\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22562","fieldValue":" ESP is a language for modeling rule-based software processes that take place in a distributed software development environment. It is based on PoliS, an abstract coordination model that relies on Multiple Tuple Spaces, i.e., collections of tuples a la Linda. PoliS extends Linda aiming at the specification and coordination of logically distributed systems. ESP (Extended Shared Prolog) combines the PoliS mechanisms to deal with concurrency and distribution, with the logic-programming language Prolog, to deal with rules and deduction. Such a combination of a coordination model and a logic language provides a powerful framework in which experiments about rule-based software process programming can be performed and evaluated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22563","fieldValue":" Maintenance tends to degrade the structure of software, ultimately making maintenance more costly. At times, then, it is worthwhile to manipulate the structure of a system to make changes easier. However, manual restructuring is an error-prone and expensive activity. By separating structural manipulations from other maintenance activities, the semantics of a system can be held constant by a tool, assuring that no errors are introduced by restructuring. To allow the maintenance team to focus on the aspects of restructuring and maintenance requiring human judgment, a transformation-based tool can be providedâ\u20AC\u201Dbased on a model that exploits preserving data flow dependence and control flow dependenceâ\u20AC\u201Dto automate the repetitive, error-prone, and computationally demanding aspects of restructuring. A set of automatable transformations is introduced; their impact on structure is described, and their usefulness is demonstrated in examples. A model to aid building meaning-preserving restructuring transformations is described, and its realization in a functioning prototype tool for restructuring Scheme programs is discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22563","fieldValue":"CASE"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22563","fieldValue":"ACM"}
