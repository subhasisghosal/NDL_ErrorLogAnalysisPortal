In some instances, exposure to stereoscopic immersion techniques can be lengthy, and so eye strain sets in. We propose a method for reducing eye strain induced by stereoscopic vision. After reviewing sources of eye strain linked to stereoscopic vision, we focus on one of these sources: images with high frequency content associated with large disparities. We put forward an algorithm for removing the irritating high frequencies in high horizontal disparity zones (i.e., for virtual objects appearing far from the real screen level). We elaborate on our testing protocol to establish that our image processing method reduces eye strain caused by stereoscopic vision, both objectively and subjectively. We subsequently quantify the positive effects of our algorithm on the relief of eye strain and discuss further research perspectives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3425","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3425","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25066","fieldValue":" Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods allow to sample a distribution known up to a multiplicative constant. Classical MCMC samplers are known to have very poor mixing properties when sampling multimodal distributions. The Equi-Energy sampler is an interacting MCMC sampler proposed by Kou, Zhou and Wong in 2006 to sample difficult multimodal distributions. This algorithm runs several chains at different temperatures in parallel, and allow lower-tempered chains to jump to a state from a higher-tempered chain having an energy â\u20ACœcloseâ\u20AC? to that of the current state. A major drawback of this algorithm is that it depends on many design parameters and thus, requires a significant effort to tune these parameters. In this article, we introduce an Adaptive Equi-Energy (AEE) sampler that automates the choice of the selection mecanism when jumping onto a state of the higher-temperature chain. We prove the ergodicity and a strong law of large numbers for AEE, and for the original Equi-Energy sampler as well. Finally, we apply our algorithm to motif sampling in DNA sequences."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25067","fieldValue":" We present a novel method for averaging a sequence of histogram states visited by a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution over a dense space of tree-based histograms. The computational efficiency of our posterior mean histogram estimate relies on a statistical data-structure that is sufficient for nonparametric density estimation of massive, multidimensional metric data. This data-structure is formalized as statistical regular paving (SRP). A regular paving (RP) is a binary tree obtained by selectively bisecting boxes along their first widest side. SRP augments RP by mutably caching the recursively computable sufficient statistics of the data. The base Markov chain used to propose moves for the Metropolis-Hastings chain is a random walk that data-adaptively prunes and grows the SRP histogram tree. We use a prior distribution based on Catalan numbers and detect convergence heuristically. The performance of our posterior mean SRP histogram is empirically assessed for large sample sizes simulated from several multivariate distributions that belong to the space of SRP histograms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25068","fieldValue":" Improving Importance Sampling estimators for rare event probabilities requires sharp approximations of conditional densities. This is achieved for events defined through large exceedances of the empirical mean of summands of a random walk, in the domain of large or moderate deviations. The approximation of conditional density of the trajectory of the random walk is handled on long runs. The length of those runs which is compatible with a given accuracy is discussed; simulated results are presented, which enlight the gain of the present approach over classical Importance Sampling schemes. Detailed algorithms are proposed."}
