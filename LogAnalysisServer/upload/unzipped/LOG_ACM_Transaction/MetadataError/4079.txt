Today, these systems are (re-)designed as a repository of enterprise services that are distributed throughout the available computing infrastructure. These service oriented architectures (SOAs) require advanced automatic and adaptive management concepts in order to achieve a high quality of service level in terms of, for example, availability, responsiveness, and throughput. The adaptive management has to allocate service instances to computing resources, adapt the resource allocation to unforeseen load fluctuations, and intelligently schedule individual requests to guarantee negotiated service level agreements (SLAs). Our AutoGlobe platform provides such a comprehensive adaptive service management comprising â\u20AC\u201Dstatic service-to-server allocation based on automatically detected service utilization patterns, â\u20AC\u201Dadaptive service management based on a fuzzy controller that remedies exceptional situations by automatically initiating, for example, service migration, service replication (scale-out), and â\u20AC\u201Dadaptive scheduling of individual service requests that prioritizes requests depending on the current degree of service level conformance. All three complementary control components are described in detail, and their effectiveness is analyzed by means of realistic business application scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23174","fieldValue":" One of the central problems in studying and understanding complex networks, such as online social networks or World Wide Web, is to discover hidden, either physically (e.g., interactions or hyperlinks) or logically (e.g., profiles or semantics) well-defined topological structures. From a practical point of view, a good example of such structures would be so-called network communities. Earlier studies have introduced various formulations as well as methods for the problem of identifying or extracting communities. While each of them has pros and cons as far as the effectiveness and efficiency are concerned, almost none of them has explicitly dealt with the potential relationship between the global topological property of a network and the local property of individual nodes. In order to study this problem, this paper presents a new algorithm, called ICS, which aims to discover natural network communities by inferring from the local information of nodes inherently hidden in networks based on a new centrality, that is, clustering centrality, which is a generalization of eigenvector centrality. As compared with existing methods, our method runs efficiently with a good clustering performance. Additionally, it is insensitive to its built-in parameters and prior knowledge."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23174","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23174","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3260","fieldValue":"Doel, Kees van den"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3260","fieldValue":" Wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise.
