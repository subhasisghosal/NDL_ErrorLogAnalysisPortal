{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25056","fieldValue":" In Operations Research and Management Science (OR\/MS), Discrete Event Simulation (DES) models are typically created using commercial off-the-shelf simulation packages (CSPs) such as AnyLogic#8482;, Arena#8482;, Flexsim#8482;, Simul8#8482;, SLX#8482;, Witness#8482;, and so on. A DES model represents the processes associated with a system of interest. Some models may be composed of submodels running in their own CSPs on different computers linked together over a communications network via distributed simulation software. The creation of a distributed simulation with CSPs is still complex and typically requires a partnership of problem owners, modelers, CSP vendors, and distributed simulation specialists. In an attempt to simplify this development and foster discussion between modelers and technologists, the SISO-STD-006-2010 Standard for COTS Simulation Package Interoperability Reference Models has been developed. The standard makes it possible to capture interoperability capabilities and requirements at a DES modeling level rather than a computing technical level. For example, it allows requirements for entity transfer between models to be clearly specified in DES terms (e.g. the relationship between departure and arrival simulation times and input element (queue, workstation, etc.), buffering rules, and entity priority, instead of using specialist technical terminology. This article explores the motivations for distributed simulation in this area, related work, and the rationale for the standard. The four Types of Interoperability Reference Model described in the standard are discussed and presented (A. Entity Transfer, B. Shared Resource, C. Shared Event, and D. Shared Data Structure). Case studies in healthcare and manufacturing are given to demonstrate how the standard is used in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25056","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25056","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3424","fieldValue":"Laitinen, Mikko-Ville"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3424","fieldValue":" Directional audio coding (DirAC) is a parametric time-frequency domain method for processing spatial audio based on psychophysical assumptions and on energetic analysis of the sound field. Methods to use DirAC in spatial sound synthesis for virtual worlds are presented in this article. Formal listening tests are used to show that DirAC can be used to position and to control the spatial extent of virtual sound sources with good audio quality. It is also shown that DirAC can be used to generate reverberation for N-channel horizontal listening with only two monophonic reverberators without a prominent loss in quality when compared with quality obtained with N-channel reverberators."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3424","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3424","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25057","fieldValue":" We propose new methods to solve simulation optimization problems over multidimensional discrete sets. The proposed methods are based on extending the objective function from a discrete domain to a continuous domain and applying stochastic approximation to the extended function. The extension of the objective function is constructed as a piecewise linear interpolation of the original objective function over a particular partition of $â\u201E?^d. The advantage of the proposed approach lies in that stochastic approximation is applied to the extension, not the original function, over â\u201E?d, so the estimated optimal solution at each iteration of the proposed methods is not restricted to be an integer point. Rather, we are free to approach the optimal solution aggressively by moving toward the direction of the steepest descent, thereby skipping over intervening points, thereby resulting in fast convergence in the early stage of the procedures. We provide a set of sufficient conditions under which the proposed methods guarantee the almost sure (a.s.) convergence to the optimal solution. One of such conditions is the multimodularity or L&natur;$-convexity of the objective function, which arises in various inventory systems and queueing networks with controlled admission. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in such settings."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25057","fieldValue":"Stochastic approximation over multidimensional discrete sets with applications to inventory systems and admission control of queueing networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25057","fieldValue":"ACM"}
