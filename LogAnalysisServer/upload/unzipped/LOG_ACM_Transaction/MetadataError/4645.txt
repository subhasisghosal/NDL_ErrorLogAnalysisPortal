{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25006","fieldValue":" We present a numerical inversion method for generating random variates from continuous distributions when only the density function is given. The algorithm is based on polynomial interpolation of the inverse CDF and Gauss-Lobatto integration. The user can select the required precision, which may be close to machine precision for smooth, bounded densities; the necessary tables have moderate size. Our computational experiments with the classical standard distributions (normal, beta, gamma, t-distributions) and with the noncentral chi-square, hyperbolic, generalized hyperbolic, and stable distributions showed that our algorithm always reaches the required precision. The setup time is moderate and the marginal execution time is very fast and nearly the same for all distributions. Thus for the case that large samples with fixed parameters are required the proposed algorithm is the fastest inversion method known. Speed-up factors up to 1000 are obtained when compared to inversion algorithms developed for the specific distributions. This makes our algorithm especially attractive for the simulation of copulas and for quasi--Monte Carlo applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25006","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25006","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25007","fieldValue":" Scheduling and resource management play an important role in building complex distributed systems, such as grids. In this article we study the impact on performance of job service demand variability in a two-level grid architecture, given that the grid and local schedulers are unaware of each job's service demand. We examine two scheduling policies at grid level, which utilize site load information and three policies at local level. A simulation model is used to evaluate performance. Results show that service demand variability degrades performance, and thus a suitable local resource allocation policy is needed to reduce its impact."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25007","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25008","fieldValue":"Tay, Victor Su-Han"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25008","fieldValue":" As a collective and highly dynamic social group, the human crowd is a fascinating phenomenon that has been frequently studied by experts from various areas. Recently, computer-based modeling and simulation technologies have emerged to support investigation of the dynamics of crowds, such as a crowd's behaviors under normal and emergent situations. This article assesses the major existing technologies for crowd modeling and simulation. We first propose a two-dimensional categorization mechanism to classify existing work depending on the size of crowds and the time-scale of the crowd phenomena of interest. Four evaluation criteria have also been introduced to evaluate existing crowd simulation systems from the point of view of both a modeler and an end-user. We have discussed some influential existing work in crowd modeling and simulation regarding their major features, performance as well as the technologies used in this work. We have also discussed some open problems in the area. This article will provide the researchers with useful information and insights on the state of the art of the technologies in crowd modeling and simulation as well as future research directions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25008","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25008","fieldValue":"ACM"}
