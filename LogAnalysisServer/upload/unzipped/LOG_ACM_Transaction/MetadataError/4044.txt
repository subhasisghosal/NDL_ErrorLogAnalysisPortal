{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23034","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a novel training method for a localized phrase-based prediction model for statistical machine translation (SMT). The model predicts block neighbors to carry out a phrase-based translation that explicitly handles local phrase reordering. We use a maximum likelihood criterion to train a log-linear block bigram model which uses real-valued features (e.g., a language model score) as well as binary features based on the block identities themselves (e.g., block bigram features). The model training relies on an efficient enumeration of local block neighbors in parallel training data. A novel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training algorithm is presented that can easily handle millions of features. Moreover, when viewing SMT as a block generation process, it becomes quite similar to sequential natural language annotation problems such as part-of-speech tagging, phrase chunking, or shallow parsing. Our novel approach is successfully tested on a standard Arabic-English translation task using two different phrase reordering models: a block orientation model and a phrase-distortion model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23034","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23034","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23035","fieldValue":" This article describes how an object-oriented approach can be applied to the architectural design of a spoken language dialog system with the aim of facilitating the modification, extension, and reuse of discourse-related expertise. The architecture of the developed system is described and a functionally similar VoiceXML system is used to provide a comparative baseline across a range of modification and reuse scenarios. It is shown that the use of an object-oriented dialog manager can provide a capable means of reusing existing discourse expertise in a manner that limits the degree of structural decay associated with system change."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23036","fieldValue":" Spoken language generation for dialogue systems requires a dictionary of mappings between the semantic representations of concepts that the system wants to express and the realizations of those concepts. Dictionary creation is a costly process; it is currently done by hand for each dialogue domain. We propose a novel unsupervised method for learning such mappings from user reviews in the target domain and test it in the restaurant and hotel domains. Experimental results show that the acquired mappings achieve high consistency between the semantic representation and the realization and that the naturalness of the realization is significantly higher than the baseline."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23036","fieldValue":"An unsupervised method for learning generation dictionaries for spoken dialogue systems by mining user reviews"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23036","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23036","fieldValue":"ACM"}
