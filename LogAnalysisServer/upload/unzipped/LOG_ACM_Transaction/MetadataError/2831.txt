Such functionality is required by numerical libraries that use different data layouts internally. Parallel algorithms and a software package for in-place matrix storage format conversion based on in-place matrix transposition are presented and evaluated. A new algorithm for in-place transposition which efficiently determines the structure of the transposition permutation a priori is one of the key ingredients. It enables effective load balancing in a parallel environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19321","fieldValue":"De Witte, Virginie"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19321","fieldValue":"Kuznetsov, Yuri A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19321","fieldValue":" matcont is a matlab continuation package for the interactive numerical study of a range of parameterized nonlinear dynamical systems, in particular ODEs, that allows to compute curves of equilibria, limit points, Hopf points, limit cycles, flip, fold and torus bifurcation points of limit cycles. It is now possible to continue homoclinic-to-hyperbolic-saddle and homoclinic-to-saddle-node orbits in matcont. The implementation is done using the continuation of invariant subspaces, with the Riccati equations included in the defining system. A key feature is the possibility to initiate both types of homoclinic orbits interactively, starting from an equilibrium point and using a homotopy method. All known codimension-two homoclinic bifurcations are tested for during continuation. The test functions for inclination-flip bifurcations are implemented in a new and more efficient way. Heteroclinic orbits can now also be continued and an analogous homotopy method can be used for the initialization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19321","fieldValue":"ACM"}
