{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5526","fieldValue":" This research addresses two issues in the domain of computer training (1) whether learners are able to use exploration-based practice methods effectively to learn to use software and (2) whether some minimal computing background is necessary to be successful with minimalist training and exploration practice. An empirical study was carried out to compare exploration, exercises, and a combined format consisting of an exercise followed by exploration. Subjects of both high and low computer experience were included in the study. It was thought that the combined format might lead to superior training outcomes because it would both structure learning through an exercise and allow learners to go beyond the simple procedures in the training manual through exploration. The results showed that the performance of the low-experience subjects at test did not differ based on the type of practice. However, high-experience subjects who were trained using exercises or the combined format did significantly better than those trained using exploration alone. The similarity of performance of subjects in the exercise and combined practice conditions suggests that the exercise component of the practice explains their success."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5526","fieldValue":"Hands-on practice in learning to use software: a comparison of exercise, exploration, and combined formats"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5527","fieldValue":" Graph drawings are increasingly finding their way into user interfaces to convey a variety of relationships. This article deals with rendering graphs to show proximity between vertices by making their configuration (screen) distances reflect their distances in the graph. An arrangement method is described that achieves good drawings at speeds suitable for user interaction on a desktop computer. The method is â\u20ACœincrementalâ\u20AC? in that it first arranges a small portion of the graph, then arranges successively larger fractions of the graph until a suitable arrangement for the entirety is achieved. The incremental approach not only offers speed improvements, but avoids many of the suboptimal solutions reached with other iterative approaches. Algorithms are described in pseudocode, and results are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5527","fieldValue":"MDS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5527","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5527","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5528","fieldValue":" Engineering models of human performance permit some aspects of usability of interface designs to be predicted from an analysis of the task, and thus they can replace to some extent expensive user-testing data. We successfully predicted human performance in telephone operator tasks with engineering models constructed in the EPIC (Executive Process-Interactive Control) architecture for human information processing, which is especially suited for modeling multimodal, complex tasks, and has demonstrated success in other task domains. Several models were constructed on an a priori basis to represent different hypotheses about how operators coordinate their activities to produce rapid task performance. The models predicted the total time with useful accuracy and clarified some important properties of the task. The best model was based directly on the GOMS analysis of the task and made simple assumptions about the operator's task strategy, suggesting that EPIC models are a feasible approach to predicting performance in multimodal high-performance tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5528","fieldValue":"Predictive engineering models based on the EPIC architecture for a multimodal high-performance human-computer interaction task"}
