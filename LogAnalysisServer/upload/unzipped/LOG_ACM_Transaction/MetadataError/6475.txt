Simultaneous analysis of unstructured and structured data enables the discovery of hidden relationships that cannot be identified from either of these sources when analyzed independently of each other. In this work, we present a visual text analytics tool for semi-structured documents (ViTA-SSD), that aims to support the user in the exploration and finding of insightful patterns in a visual and interactive manner in a semi-structured collection of documents. It achieves this goal by presenting to the user a set of coordinated visualizations that allows the linking of the metadata with interactively generated clusters of documents in such a way that relevant patterns can be easily spotted. The system contains two novel approaches in its back end: a feature-learning method to learn a compact representation of the corpus and a fast-clustering approach that has been redesigned to allow user supervision. These novel contributions make it possible for the user to interact with a large and dynamic document collection and to perform several text analytical tasks more efficiently. Finally, we present two use cases that illustrate the suitability of the system for in-depth interactive exploration of semi-structured document collections, two user studies, and results of several evaluations of our text-mining components."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7225","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7225","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1659","fieldValue":" The need to reduce power and complexity will increase the interest in Switch On Event multithreading (coarse-grained multithreading). Switch On Event multithreading is a low-power and low-complexity mechanism to improve processor throughput by switching threads on execution stalls. Fairness may, however, become a problem in a multithreaded processor. Unless fairness is properly handled, some threads may starve while others consume all of the processor cycles. Heuristics that were devised in order to improve fairness in simultaneous multithreading are not applicable to Switch On Event multithreading. This paper defines the fairness metric using the ratio of the individual threads' speedups and shows how it can be enforced in Switch On Event multithreading. Fairness is controlled by forcing additional thread switch points. These switch points are determined dynamically by runtime estimation of the single threaded performance of each of the individual threads. We analyze the impact of the fairness enforcement mechanism on aggregate IPC and weighted speedup. We present simulation results of the performance of Switch On Event multithreading. Switch On Event multithreading achieves an average aggregate IPC increase of 26&percnt; over single thread and 12&percnt; weighted speedup when no fairness is enforced. In this case, a sixth of our runs resulted in poor fairness in which one thread ran extremely slowly (10 to 100 times slower than its single-thread performance), while the other thread's performance was hardly affected. By using the proposed mechanism, we can guarantee fairness at different levels of strictness and, in most cases, even improve the weighted speedup."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1659","fieldValue":"SOE"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1659","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1659","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7226","fieldValue":"Frayret, Jean-Marc"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7226","fieldValue":" This article presents a review and a classification of interactive optimization methods. These interactive methods are used for solving optimization problems. The interaction with an end user or decision maker aims at improving the efficiency of the optimization procedure, enriching the optimization model, or informing the user regarding the solutions proposed by the optimization system. First, we present the challenges of using optimization methods as a tool for supporting decision making, and we justify the integration of the user in the optimization process. This integration is generally achieved via a dynamic interaction between the user and the system. Next, the different classes of interactive optimization approaches are presented. This detailed review includes trial and error, interactive reoptimization, interactive multiobjective optimization, interactive evolutionary algorithms, human-guided search, and other approaches that are less well covered in the research literature. On the basis of this review, we propose a classification that aims to better describe and compare interaction mechanisms. This classification offers two complementary views on interactive optimization methods. The first perspective focuses on the userâ\u20AC™s contribution to the optimization process, and the second concerns the components of interactive optimization systems. Finally, on the basis of this review and classification, we identify some open issues and potential perspectives for interactive optimization methods."}
