{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10248","fieldValue":" Complex interference in static multihop wireless mesh networks can adversely affect transport protocol performance. Since TCP does not explicitly account for this, starvation and unfairness can result from the use of TCP over such networks. In this paper, we explore mechanisms for achieving fair and efficient congestion control for multihop wireless mesh networks. First, we design an AIMD-based rate-control protocol called Wireless Control Protocol (WCP), which recognizes that wireless congestion is a neighborhood phenomenon, not a node-local one, and appropriately reacts to such congestion. Second, we design a distributed rate controller that estimates the available capacity within each neighborhood and divides this capacity to contending flows, a scheme we call Wireless Control Protocol with Capacity estimation (WCPCap). Using analysis, simulations, and real deployments, we find that our designs yield rates that are both fair and efficient. WCP assigns rates inversely proportional to the number of bottlenecks a flow passes through while remaining extremely easy to implement. An idealized version of WCPCap is max-min fair, whereas a practical implementation of the scheme achieves rates within 15% of the max-min optimal rates while still being distributed and amenable to real implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10248","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10248","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10248","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10249","fieldValue":"Budzisz, ukasz"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10249","fieldValue":" This paper presents and develops a novel delay-based additive increase, multiplicative decrease (AIMD) congestion control algorithm. The main features of the proposed solution include: 1) low standing queues and delay in homogeneous environments (with delay-based flows only); 2) fair coexistence of delay- and loss-based flows in heterogeneous environments; 3) delay-based flows behave as loss-based flows when loss-based flows are present in the network; otherwise they revert to delay-based operation. It is also shown that these properties can be achieved without any appreciable increase in network loss rate over that which would be present in a comparable network of standard TCP flows (loss-based AIMD). To demonstrate the potential of the presented algorithm, both analytical and simulation results are provided in a range of different network scenarios. These include stability and convergence results in general multiple-bottleneck networks and a number of simulation scenarios to demonstrate the utility of the proposed scheme. In particular, we show that networks employing our algorithm have the features of networks in which RED AQM's are deployed. Furthermore, in a wide range of situations (including high-speed scenarios), we show that low delay is achieved irrespective of the queueing algorithm employed in the network, with only sender-side modification to the basic AIMD algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10249","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10249","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10249","fieldValue":"ACM"}
