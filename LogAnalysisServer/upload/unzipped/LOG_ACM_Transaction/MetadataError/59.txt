Following the sharp rise in the number of computer and video games courses across higher education (HE) institutions in the UK and across the globe, this article examines the composition of existing British games design, development, and art programs in relation to prescribed study areas voiced by industry bodies. From a sample of 242 courses, and a further 11 industry-derived and accredited programs, the results explore content currently residing within a variety of games programs and qualification types and evaluate the extent to which such content adheres to the industryâ\u20AC™s demand for the focus on specific skills and study areas. The findings point toward certain shortfalls in some key areas deemed to be important by industry professionals and the consideration of the degree to which course providers should cater to the specific demands of industry."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11144","fieldValue":"Fitting the Needs of an Industry: An Examination of Games Design, Development, and Art Courses in the UK"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11145","fieldValue":"McGill, Monica M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11145","fieldValue":" Digital games are marketed, mass-produced, and consumed by an increasing number of people and the game industry is only expected to grow. In response, postsecondary institutions in the UK and the U.S. have started to create game degree programs. Though curriculum theorists provide insight into the process of creating a new program, no formal research contextualizes curriculum planning for game degree programs. The purpose of this research was to explore these processes when planning undergraduate game degree programs. The research methodology included an explanatory mixed-methods approach, using a quantitative survey of participants in the UK and the U.S., followed by interviews with several participants selected on the basis of their institutionâ\u20AC™s demographics. Results indicate that five external factors influence the development of game programs (government, industry, other universities, society, and trade associations) and eight internal factors influence curriculum planning (facilities, faculty, institution, interdisciplinary collaboration, learners, learning time and space, originating department, and backgrounds of the planners). Results also indicate that while some differences exist in the game degree programs across countries, the vast majority of curriculum planning processes and influencing factors are the same. The study concludes with a set of recommendations for educators, trade associations, and the games industry to improve game degree programs."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11145","fieldValue":"The Curriculum Planning Process for Undergraduate Game Degree Programs in the United Kingdom and United States"}
