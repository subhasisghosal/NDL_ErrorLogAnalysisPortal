While the Web has become an immense, diverse information space, it has also evolved into a powerful software platform. We believe that the established interaction techniques of searching and browsing do not sufficiently utilize these advances, since information seekers have to transform their information needs into specific, text-based search queries resulting in mostly text-based lists of resources. In contrast, we foresee a new type of information seeking that is high-level and more engaging, by providing the information seeker with interactive visualizations that give graphical overviews and enable query formulation. Building on recent work on faceted navigation, information visualization, and exploratory search, we conceptualize this type of information navigation as visual exploration and evaluate a prototype Web-based system that implements it. We discuss the results of a large-scale, mixed-method Web study that provides a better understanding of the potential benefits of visual exploration on the Web, and its particular performance challenges."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23253","fieldValue":"Cambazoglu, B Barla"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23253","fieldValue":"Ulusoy, zgr"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23253","fieldValue":" In practice, a search engine may fail to serve a query due to various reasons such as hardware\/network failures, excessive query load, lack of matching documents, or service contract limitations (e.g., the query rate limits for third-party users of a search service). In this kind of scenarios, where the backend search system is unable to generate answers to queries, approximate answers can be generated by exploiting the previously computed query results available in the result cache of the search engine. In this work, we propose two alternative strategies to implement this cache-based query processing idea. The first strategy aggregates the results of similar queries that are previously cached in order to create synthetic results for new queries. The second strategy forms an inverted index over the textual information (i.e., query terms and result snippets) present in the result cache and uses this index to answer new queries. Both approaches achieve reasonable result qualities compared to processing queries with an inverted index built on the collection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23254","fieldValue":" In recent years, the ubiquitous demands for cross-protocol application access are driving the need for deeper integration between SIP and SOAP. In this article we present a novel methodology for integrating these two protocols. Through an analysis of properties of SIP and SOAP we show that integration between these protocols should be based on application-specific converters. We describe a generic SIP\/SOAP gateway that implements message handling and network and storage management while relying on application-specific converters to define session management and message mapping for a specific set of SIP and SOAP communication nodes. In order to ease development of these converters, we introduce an XML-based domain-specific language for describing application-specific conversion processes. We show how conversion processes can be easily specified in the language using message sequence diagrams of the desired interaction. We evaluate the presented methodology through performance analysis of the developed prototype gateway and high-level comparison with other solutions."}
