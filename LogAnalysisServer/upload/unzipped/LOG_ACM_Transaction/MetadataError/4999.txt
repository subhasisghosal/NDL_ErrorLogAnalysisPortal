The deployment of a spherical array is not trivial especially for implementation in real rooms where the placement flexibility is highly desirable. This paper proposes a design of multiple circular loudspeaker arrays for reproducing three dimensional sound fields originating from a limited region of interest. We apply a functional analysis framework to formulate the sound field reproduction problem in a closed form. Secondary source distributions and target sound fields are modeled as two Hilbert spaces and mapped by an integral operator and its adjoint operator, from which a self-adjoint operator is constructed and the singular value decomposition is applied to represent source distributions and sound fields with two sets of interrelated singular functions. We derive the solutions for a circular secondary source arrangement and propose the design of placing multiple circular loudspeaker arrays only over the limited region of interest. Such a design allows for non-spherical and non-uniform loudspeaker placement and thus provides a flexible array arrangement. The reproduction accuracy of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3673","fieldValue":"Three dimensional sound field reproduction using multiple circular loudspeaker arrays: functional analysis guided approach"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3673","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3673","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3674","fieldValue":"Habets, Emanul A P"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3674","fieldValue":" Hands-free acquisition of speech is required in many human-machine interfaces and communication systems. The signals received by integrated microphones contain a desired speech signal, spatially coherent interfering signals, and background noise. In order to enhance the desired speech signal, state-of-the-art techniques apply data-dependent spatial filters which require the second order statistics (SOS) of the desired signal, the interfering signals and the background noise. As the number of sources and the reverberation time increase, the estimation accuracy of the SOS deteriorates, often resulting in insufficient noise and interference reduction. In this paper, a signal extraction framework with distributed microphone arrays is developed. An expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm detects the number of coherent speech sources and estimates source clusters using time-frequency (TF) bin-wise position estimates. Subsequently, the second order statistics (SOS) are estimated using bin-wise speech presence probability (SPP) and a source probability for each source. Finally, a desired source is extracted using a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) filter, a multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) and a parametric multichannel Wiener filter (PMWF). The same framework can be employed for source separation, where a spatial filter is computed for each source considering the remaining sources as interferers. Evaluation using simulated and measured data demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework in estimating the number of sources, clustering, signal enhancement, and source separation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3674","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3674","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3675","fieldValue":" In pursuing machine understanding of human language, highly accurate syntactic analysis is a crucial step. In this work, we focus on dependency grammar, which models syntax by encoding transparent predicate-argument structures. Recent advances in dependency parsing have shown that employing higher-order subtree structures in graph-based parsers can substantially improve the parsing accuracy. However, the inefficiency of this approach increases with the order of the subtrees. This work explores a new reranking approach for dependency parsing that can utilize complex subtree representations by applying efficient sub-tree selection methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in experiments conducted on the Penn Treebank and the Chinese Treebank. Our system achieves the best performance among known supervised systems evaluated on these datasets, improving the baseline accuracy from 91.88% to 93.42% for English, and from 87.39% to 89.25% for Chinese."}
