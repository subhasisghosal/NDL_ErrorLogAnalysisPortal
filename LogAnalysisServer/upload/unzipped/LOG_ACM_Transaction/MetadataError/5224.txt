The method relies primarily on the geometric 3D structure of the proteins, which is produced from the corresponding PDB files and secondarily on their primary and secondary structure. After proper positioning of the 3D structures, in terms of translation and scaling, the Spherical Trace Transform is applied to them so as to produce geometry-based descriptor vectors, which are completely rotation invariant and perfectly describe their 3D shape. Additionally, characteristic attributes of the primary and secondary structure of the protein molecules are extracted, forming attribute-based descriptor vectors. The descriptor vectors are weighted and an integrated descriptor vector is produced. Three classification methods are tested. A part of the FSSP\/DALI database, which provides a structural classification of the proteins, is used as the ground truth in order to evaluate the classification accuracy of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more than 99 percent classification accuracy while remaining much simpler and faster than the DALI method."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4242","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4243","fieldValue":" In this paper, we address the multiple peak alignment problem in sequential data analysis with an approach based on the Gaussian scale-space theory. We assume that multiple sets of detected peaks are the observed samples of a set of common peaks. We also assume that the locations of the observed peaks follow unimodal distributions (e.g., normal distribution) with their means equal to the corresponding locations of the common peaks and variances reflecting the extension of their variations. Under these assumptions, we convert the problem of estimating locations of the unknown number of common peaks from multiple sets of detected peaks into a much simpler problem of searching for local maxima in the scale-space representation. The optimization of the scale parameter is achieved using an energy minimization approach. We compare our approach with a hierarchical clustering method using both simulated data and real mass spectrometry data. We also demonstrate the merit of extending the binary peak detection method (i.e., a candidate is considered either as a peak or as a nonpeak) with a quantitative scoring measure-based approach (i.e., we assign to each candidate a possibility of being a peak)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4243","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4243","fieldValue":"Biomarker discovery, peak identification, multiple peak alignment, scale-space, prior information, energy minimization, parameter optimization."}
