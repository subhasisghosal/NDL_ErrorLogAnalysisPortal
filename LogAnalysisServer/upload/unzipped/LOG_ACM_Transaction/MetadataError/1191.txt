Views allow to compare widely different workflow systems by mapping them to a common representation capturing the observables relevant to the comparison. Using this framework, we compare the expressiveness of several workflow specification mechanisms, including automata, temporal constraints, and pre-and postconditions, with XML and relational databases as underlying data models. One surprising result shows the considerable power of static constraints to simulate apparently much richer workflow control mechanisms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14563","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of computing efficient anonymizations of partitioned databases. Given a database that is partitioned between several sites, either horizontally or vertically, we devise secure distributed algorithms that allow the different sites to obtain a k-anonymized and &ell;-diverse view of the union of their databases, without disclosing sensitive information. Our algorithms are based on the sequential algorithm &lsqb;Goldberger and Tassa 2010&rsqb; that offers anonymizations with utility that is significantly better than other anonymization algorithms, and in particular those that were implemented so far in the distributed setting. Our algorithms can apply to different generalization techniques and utility measures and to any number of sites. While previous distributed algorithms depend on costly cryptographic primitives, the cryptographic assumptions of our solution are surprisingly minimal."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/14563","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-anonymization"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14563","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-anonymization"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14563","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14563","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14564","fieldValue":" An (edge) hidden graph is a graph whose edges are notexplicitly given. Detecting the presence of an edge requires an expensive edge probing query. We consider the k Most Connected Vertex (k-MCV) problem on hidden bipartite graphs. Given a bipartite graph G with independent vertex sets B and W, the goal is to find the k vertices in B with the largest degrees using the minimum number of queries. This problem can be regarded as a top-k extension of semi-join, and is encountered in several applications in practice. If B and W have n and m vertices, respectively, the number of queries needed to solve the problem is nm in the worst case. This, however, is a pessimistic estimate on how many queries are necessary on practical data. In fact, on some inputs, the problem may be settled with only km + n queries, which is significantly lower than nm for k &Lt; n. The huge difference between km + n and nm makes it interesting to design an adaptive algorithm that is guaranteed to achieve the best possible performance on every input G. For k &leq; n\/2, we give an algorithm that is instance optimal among a broad class of solutions. This means that, for any G, our algorithm can perform more queries than the optimal solution (which is unknown) by only a constant factor, which can be shown at most 2. As a second step, we study an &epsiv;-approximate version of the k-MCV problem, where &epsiv; is a parameter satisfying 0 < &epsiv; < 1. The goal is to return k black vertices $b_1, â\u20AC¦, bk such that the degree of bi (i &leq; k) can be smaller than ti by a factor of at most &epsiv;, where ti, â\u20AC¦, tk (in nonascending order) are the degrees of the k most connected black vertices. We give an efficient randomized algorithm that successfully finds the correct answer with high probability. In particular, for a fixed &epsiv; and a fixed success probability, our algorithm performs o(nm) queries in expectation for tk &equals; Ï\u2030(log n). In other words, whenever tk$ is greater than log n by more than a constant, our algorithm beats the Î©(nm) lower bound for solving the k-MCV problem exactly. All the proposed algorithms, despite the complication of their underlying theory, are simple enough for easy implementation in practice. Extensive experiments have confirmed that their performance in reality agrees with our theoretical findings very well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14564","fieldValue":"ACM"}
