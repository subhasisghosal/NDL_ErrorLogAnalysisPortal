We show that if memory and bandwidth are bounded at moving objects, then the problem of determining whether a set of data items can be disseminated to all the moving objects is NP-complete. For a heuristic solution we postulate that a moving object should save and transmit the data items that are most likely to be new (i.e., previously unknown) to future encountered moving objects. We propose a method to be used by each moving object to prioritize data items based on their probabilities of being new to future receivers. The method employs a machine learning system for estimation of the novelty probability and the machine learning system is progressively trained by received data items. Through simulations based on real mobility traces, we show the superiority of the method against some natural alternatives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1176","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1176","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15853","fieldValue":" We present a discrete particle based method capable of creating very realistic animations of bubbles in fluids. It allows for the generation (nucleation) of bubbles from gas dissolved in the fluid, the motion of the discrete bubbles including bubble collisions and drag interactions with the liquid which could be undergoing complex free surface motion, the formation and motion of coupled foams and the final dissipation of bubbles. This allows comprehensive simulations of dynamic bubble behavior. The underlying fluid simulation is based on the mesh-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method. Each particle representing the liquid contains an amount of dissolved gas. Gas is transferred from the continuum fluid model to the discrete bubble model at nucleation sites on the surface of solid bodies. The rate of gas transport to the nucleation sites controls the rate of bubble generation, producing very natural time variations in bubble numbers. Rising bubbles also grow by gathering more gas from the surrounding liquid as they move. This model contains significant bubble scale physics and allows, in principle, the capturing of many important processes that cannot be directly modeled by traditional methods. The method is used here to realistically animate the pouring of a glass of beer, starting with a stream of fresh beer entering the glass, the formation of a dense cloud of bubbles, which rise to create a good head as the beer reaches the top of the glass."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15853","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15853","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15854","fieldValue":" Liquid and gas interactions often produce bubbles that stay for a long time without bursting on the surface, making a dry foam structure. Such long lasting bubbles simulated by the level set method can suffer from a small but steady volume error that accumulates to a visible amount of volume change. We propose to address this problem by using the volume control method. We track the volume change of each connected region, and apply a carefully computed divergence that compensates undesired volume changes. To compute the divergence, we construct a mathematical model of the volume change, choose control strategies that regulate the modeled volume error, and establish methods to compute the control gains that provide robust and fast reduction of the volume error, and (if desired) the control of how the volume changes over time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15854","fieldValue":"ACM"}
