Our research focuses on three aspects of intelligent assistance for to-dos. We investigated the use of intelligent agents to automate to-dos in an office setting. We collected a large corpus from users and developed a paraphrase-based approach to matching agent capabilities with to-dos. We also investigated to-dos for personal tasks and the kinds of assistance that can be offered to users by elaborating on them on the basis of substep knowledge extracted from the Web. Finally, we explored coordination of user tasks with other users through a to-do management application deployed in a popular social networking site. We discuss the emergence of Social Task Networks, which link usersâ\u20AC˜ tasks to their social network as well as to relevant resources on the Web. We show the benefits of using common sense knowledge to interpret and elaborate to-dos. Conversely, we also show that to-do lists are a valuable way to create repositories of common sense knowledge about tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7147","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7147","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7148","fieldValue":"Gordon, Andrew S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7148","fieldValue":" We describe Say Anything, a new interactive storytelling system that collaboratively writes textual narratives with human users. Unlike previous attempts, this interactive storytelling system places no restrictions on the content or direction of the userâ\u20AC™s contribution to the emerging storyline. In response to these contributions, the computer continues the storyline with narration that is both coherent and entertaining. This capacity for open-domain interactive storytelling is enabled by an extremely large repository of nonfiction personal stories, which is used as a knowledge base in a case-based reasoning architecture. In this article, we describe the three main components of our case-based reasoning approach: a million-item corpus of personal stories mined from internet weblogs, a case retrieval strategy that is optimized for narrative coherence, and an adaptation strategy that ensures that repurposed sentences from the case base are appropriate for the userâ\u20AC™s emerging fiction. We describe a series of evaluations of the systemâ\u20AC™s ability to produce coherent and entertaining stories, and we compare these narratives with single-author stories posted to internet weblogs."}
