We present a set of new algorithms to render line-art illustrations of dynamic and specular (reflective and refractive) surfaces. We first introduce a real-time principal direction estimation algorithm to determine the line stroke directions on dynamic opaque objects using neighboring normal ray triplets. To render reflections or refractions in a line-art style, we develop a stroke direction propagation algorithm by using multi-perspective projections to propagate the stroke directions from the nearby opaque objects onto specular surfaces. Finally, we present an image-space stroke mapping method to draw line strokes using the computed or propagated stroke directions. We implement these algorithms using a GPU and demonstrate real-time illustrations of scenes with dynamic and specular 3D models in line-art styles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16025","fieldValue":" Curves on objects can convey the inherent features of the shape. This paper defines a new class of view-independent curves, denoted demarcating curves. In a nutshell, demarcating curves are the loci of the \"strongest\" inflections on the surface. Due to their appealing capabilities to extract and emphasize 3D textures, they are applied to artifact illustration in archaeology, where they can serve as a worthy alternative to the expensive, time-consuming, and biased manual depiction currently used."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16025","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16025","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16026","fieldValue":" We present a novel method for procedurally modeling large complex shapes. Our approach is general-purpose and takes as input any 3D polyhedral model provided by a user. The algorithm exploits the connectivity between the adjacent boundary features of the input model and computes an output model that has similar connected features and resembles the input. No additional user input is needed to guide the model generation and the algorithm proceeds automatically. In practice, our algorithm is simple to implement and can generate a variety of complex shapes representing buildings, landscapes, and 3D fractal shapes in a few minutes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16026","fieldValue":"ACM"}
