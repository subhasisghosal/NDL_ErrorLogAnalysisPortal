We show that these continuous and non-negative coefficients ensuring linear precision can be efficiently and exactly computed through a power diagram of the polytope's vertices and the evaluation point. In particular, we point out that well-known explicit coordinates such as Wachspress, Discrete Harmonic, Voronoi, or Mean Value correspond to simple choices of power weights. We also present examples of new barycentric coordinates, and discuss possible extensions such as power coordinates for non-convex polygons and smooth shapes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17739","fieldValue":"de Goes, Fernando"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17739","fieldValue":" This paper presents a variational method to generate cell complexes with local anisotropy conforming to the Hessian of any given convex function and for any given local mesh density. Our formulation builds upon approximation theory to offer an anisotropic extension of Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations which can be seen as a dual form of Optimal Delaunay Triangulation. We thus refer to the resulting anisotropic polytopal meshes as Optimal Voronoi Tessellations. Our approach sharply contrasts with previous anisotropic versions of Voronoi diagrams as it employs first-type Bregman diagrams, a generalization of power diagrams where sites are augmented with not only a scalar-valued weight but also a vector-valued shift. As such, our OVT meshes contain only convex cells with straight edges, and admit an embedded dual triangulation that is combinatorially-regular. We show the effectiveness of our technique using off-the-shelf computational geometry libraries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17739","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17739","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2677","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of computing the distance between two piecewise-linear bivariate functions f and g defined over a common domain M, induced by the $L_2 normâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, &Verbar; f âˆ\u2019 g&Verbar;2 &equals; &sqrt;&intM$(f âˆ\u2019âˆ\u2019 $g)^2. If f is defined by linear interpolation over a triangulation of M with n triangles and g is defined over another such triangulation, the obvious naive algorithm requires Î˜(n2) arithmetic operations to compute this distance. We show that it is possible to compute it in O(nlog4$ nlog log n) arithmetic operations by reducing the problem to multipoint evaluation of a certain type of polynomials. We also present several generalizations and an application to terrain matching."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2677","fieldValue":"ACM"}
