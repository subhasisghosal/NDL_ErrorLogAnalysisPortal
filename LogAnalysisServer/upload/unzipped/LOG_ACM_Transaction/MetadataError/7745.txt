Conventional design of dynamic spectrum access focuses on maximizing spectrum utilization, but faces the problem of degraded reliability due to unregulated demands and access behaviors. Without providing proper reliability guarantee, dynamic spectrum access is unacceptable to many infrastructure networks and services. In this paper, we propose SPARTA, a new architecture for dynamic spectrum access that balances access reliability and spectrum utilization. SPARTA includes two complementary techniques: proactive admission control performed by a central entity to determine the set of wireless nodes to be supported with only statistical information of their spectrum demands, and online adaptation performed by admitted wireless nodes to adjust their instantaneous spectrum usage to time-varying demand. Using both theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that SPARTA fulfills the reliability requirements while dynamically multiplexing spectrum demands to improve utilization. Compared to conventional solutions, SPARTA improves spectrum utilization by 80%-200%. Finally, SPARTA also allows service providers to explore the tradeoff between utilization and reliability to make the best use of the spectrum. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to identify and address such a tradeoff."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10302","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10303","fieldValue":" Despite advances in measurement technology, it is still challenging to reliably compile large-scale network datasets. For example, because of flaws in the measurement systems or difficulties posed by the measurement problem itself, missing, ambiguous, or indirect data are common. In the case where such data have spatio-temporal structure, it is natural to try to leverage this structure to deal with the challenges posed by the problematic nature of the data. Our work involving network datasets draws on ideas from the area of compressive sensing and matrix completion, where sparsity is exploited in estimating quantities of interest. However, the standard results on compressive sensing are: 1) reliant on conditions that generally do not hold for network datasets; and 2) do not allow us to exploit all we know about their spatio-temporal structure. In this paper, we overcome these limitations with an algorithm that has at its heart the same ideas espoused in compressive sensing, but adapted to the problem of network datasets. We show how this algorithm can be used in a variety of ways, in particular on traffic data, to solve problems such as simple interpolation of missing values, traffic matrix inference from link data, prediction, and anomaly detection. The elegance of the approach lies in the fact that it unifies all of these tasks and allows themto be performed even when as much as 98% of the data is missing."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10303","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1937","fieldValue":" High-density DRAM devices spend significant time refreshing the DRAM cells, leading to performance drop. The JEDEC DDR4 standard provides a Fine Granularity Refresh (FGR) feature to tackle refresh. Motivated by the observation that in FGR mode, only a few banks are involved, we propose an Enhanced FGR (EFGR) feature that introduces three optimizations to the basic FGR feature and exposes the bank-level parallelism within the rank even during the refresh. The first optimization decouples the nonrefreshing banks. The second and third optimizations determine the maximum number of nonrefreshing banks that can be active during refresh and selectively precharge the banks before refresh, respectively. Our simulation results show that the EFGR feature is able to recover almost 56.6&percnt; of the performance loss incurred due to refresh operations."}
