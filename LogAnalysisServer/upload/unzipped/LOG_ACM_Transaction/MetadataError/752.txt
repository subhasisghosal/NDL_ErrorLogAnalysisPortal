{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13258","fieldValue":" Linear signal transforms such as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) are very widely used in digital signal processing and other domains. Due to high performance or efficiency requirements, these transforms are often implemented in hardware. This implementation is challenging due to the large number of algorithmic options (e.g., fast Fourier transform algorithms or FFTs), the variety of ways that a fixed algorithm can be mapped to a sequential datapath, and the design of the components of this datapath. The best choices depend heavily on the resource budget and the performance goals of the target application. Thus, it is difficult for a designer to determine which set of options will best meet a given set of requirements. In this article we introduce the Spiral hardware generation framework and system for linear transforms. The system takes a problem specification as input as well as directives that define characteristics of the desired datapath. Using a mathematical language to represent and explore transform algorithms and datapath characteristics, the system automatically generates an algorithm, maps it to a datapath, and outputs a synthesizable register transfer level Verilog description suitable for FPGA or ASIC implementation. The quality of the generated designs rivals the best available handwritten IP cores."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2264","fieldValue":" In the multicommodity rent-or-buy (MROB) network design problems, we are given a network together with a set of k terminal pairs $(s_1, t1), â\u20AC¦, (sk, tk. The goal is to provision the network so that a given amount of flow can be shipped between si and ti$ for all 1 â\u2030¤ i â\u2030¤ k simultaneously. In order to provision the network, one can either rent capacity on edges at some cost per unit of flow, or buy them at some larger fixed cost. Bought edges have no incremental, flow-dependent cost. The overall objective is to minimize the total provisioning cost. Recently, Gupta et al. [2003a] presented a 12-approximation for the MROB problem. Their algroithm chooses a subset of the terminal pairs in the graph at random and then buys the edges of an approximate Steiner forest for these pairs. This technique had previously been introduced [Gupta et al. 2003b] for the single-sink rent-or-buy network design problem. In this article we give a 6.828-approximation for the MROB problem by refining the algorithm of Gupta et al. and simplifying their analysis. The improvement in our article is based on a more careful adaptation and simplified analysis of the primal-dual algorithm for the Steiner forest problem due to Agrawal et al. [1995]. Our result significantly reduces the gap between the single-sink and multisink case."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2264","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2264","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13259","fieldValue":"Weng, Shih-Hung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13259","fieldValue":"Kuo, Yu-Min"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13259","fieldValue":"Chang, Shih-Chieh"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13259","fieldValue":" Clock gating is a popular technique for reducing power dissipation. In a circuit with clock gating, the clock signal can be shut off without changing the functionality under certain clock-gating conditions. In this article, we observe that the clock-gating conditions and the next-state function of a Flip-Flop (FF) are correlated and can be used for sequential circuit optimization. We also show that the implementation of the next-state function of any FF can be just an inverter if the clock signal is appropriately gated. By exploiting the flexibility between the clock-gating conditions and the next-state function, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm to improve the timing of sequential circuits. We present experimental results of a set of benchmark circuits with a timing improvement of 10.20&percnt; on average."}
