Consequently, the concept of using nodes with energy replenishment capabilities has been gaining popularity. However, new techniques and protocols must be developed to maximize the performance of sensor networks with energy replenishment. Here, we analyze limits of the performance of sensor nodes with limited energy, being replenished at a variable rate. We provide a simple localized energy management scheme that achieves a performance close to that with an unlimited energy source and at the same time keeps the probability of complete battery discharge low. Based on the insights developed, we address the problem of energy management for energy-replenishing nodes with finite battery and finite data buffer capacities. To this end, we give an energy management scheme that achieves the optimal utility asymptotically while keeping both the battery discharge and data loss probabilities low."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10479","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10479","fieldValue":"Basic performance limits and tradeoffs in energy-harvesting sensor nodes with finite data and energy storage"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10480","fieldValue":" It has been recently shown that queue-based carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) algorithms are throughput-optimal. In these algorithms, each link of the wireless network has two parameters: a transmission probability and an access probability. The transmission probability of each link is chosen as an appropriate function of its queue length, however the access probabilities are simply regarded as some random numbers since they do not play any role in establishing the network stability. In this paper, we show that the access probabilities control the mixing time of the CSMA Markov chain and, as a result, affect the delay performance of the CSMA. In particular, we derive formulas that relate the mixing time to access probabilities and use these to develop the following guideline for choosing access probabilities: Each link i should choose its access probability equal to1\/(di+1), where di is the number of links that interfere with link i. Simulation results show that this choice of access probabilities results in good delay performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10480","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
