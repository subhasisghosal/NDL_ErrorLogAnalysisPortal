{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13140","fieldValue":" This work presents a static timing-analysis method for verification of scenario-based real-time properties, on graphical task-level models of embedded applications. Scenario-based properties specify timing constraints which must be honored for specific control-flow behaviors and task execution orderings. Static checking of scenario-based properties currently requires computationally expensive model checking methods. Hence the proposed graph-based static timing-analysis algorithm improves upon the state-of-the-art. This is manifested in a significant performance advantage over timed model checking (up to 1000X in several cases), which suffers from state space explosion. The proposed algorithm also employs compositional reasoning and abstraction refinement for handling large problems. We also illustrate methods for using scenario-based timing analysis, which can act as alternatives to traditional timed model checking for verification of timed systems like FDDI and Fischer protocols. We implement this timing verification algorithm as a tool called SymTime and present experimental results for SymTime comparing it with SPIN, UPPAAL, and a TCTL model checker for Time Petri Nets, called Romeo."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13140","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13140","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13141","fieldValue":" Whereas the computing power of DSP or general-purpose processors was sufficient for 3G baseband telecommunication algorithms, stringent timing constraints of 4G wireless telecommunication systems require computing-intensive data-driven architectures. Managing the complexity of these systems within the energy constraints of a mobile terminal is becoming a major challenge for designers. System-level low-power policies have been widely explored for generic software-based systems, but data-flow architectures used for high data-rate telecommunication systems feature heterogeneous components that require specific configurations for power management. In this study, we propose an innovative power optimization scheme tailored to self-synchronized data-flow systems. Our technique, based on the synchronous data-flow modeling approach, takes advantage of the latest low-power techniques available for digital architectures. We illustrate our optimization method on a complete 4G telecommunication baseband modem and show the energy savings expected by this technique considering present and future silicon technologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13141","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13141","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13142","fieldValue":"Cheung, Peter Y K"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13142","fieldValue":" This article describes the first method for minimizing the dynamic power consumption of a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithm implemented on reconfigurable hardware via word-length optimization. Fast models for estimating the power consumption of the arithmetic components and the routing power of these algorithm implementations are used within a constrained nonlinear optimization formulation that solves a relaxed version of word-length optimization. Tight lower and upper bounds on the cost of the integer word-length problem can be obtained using the proposed solution, with typical upper bounds being 2.9&percnt; and 5.1&percnt; larger than the lower bounds for area and power consumption, respectively. Heuristics can then use the upper bound as a starting point from which to get even closer to the known lower bound. Results show that power consumption can be improved by up to 40&percnt; compared to that achieved when using simple word-length selection techniques, and further comparisons are made between the minimization of different cost functions that give insight into the advantages offered by multiple word-length optimization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13142","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13142","fieldValue":"ACM"}
