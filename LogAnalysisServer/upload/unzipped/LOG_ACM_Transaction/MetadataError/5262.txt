We design an analysis to remove or resolve most of these problems and to extract corrected data where markers occur in consecutive strips in both genomes. To do this we introduce the notion of pre-strip, an efficient way of generating these, and a compatibility analysis culminating in a Maximum Weighted Clique (MWC) search. The output can be directly analyzed with genome rearrangement algorithms, allowing the restoration of some of the data not incorporated into the clique solution. We investigate the trade-off between criteria for discarding excessive pre-strips to make MWC feasible, in terms of retaining as many markers as possible in the solution and producing an economical rearrangement analysis. We explore these questions through simulation and through comparison of the rice and sorghum genomes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4316","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
