Unfortunately, generalizations of divided differences to irregular knot geometries on two-dimensional domains are quite limited. As a result, most spline constructions for such domains typically focus on regular (or semi-regular) knot geometries. In the planar harmonic case, we show that the discrete Laplacian plays a role similar to that of the divided differences and can be used to define well-behaved harmonic B-splines. In our main contribution, we then construct an analogous discrete bi-Laplacian for both planar and curved domains and show that its corresponding biharmonic B-splines are also well-behaved. Finally, we derive a fully irregular, discrete refinement scheme for these splines that generalizes knot insertion for univariate B-splines."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16704","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16704","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16705","fieldValue":" Human hair is known to be very difficult to model or reconstruct. In this paper, we focus on applications related to portrait manipulation and take an application-driven approach to hair modeling. To enable an average user to achieve interesting portrait manipulation results, we develop a single-view hair modeling technique with modest user interaction to meet the unique requirements set by portrait manipulation. Our method relies on heuristics to generate a plausible high-resolution strand-based 3D hair model. This is made possible by an effective high-precision 2D strand tracing algorithm, which explicitly models uncertainty and local layering during tracing. The depth of the traced strands is solved through an optimization, which simultaneously considers depth constraints, layering constraints as well as regularization terms. Our single-view hair modeling enables a number of interesting applications that were previously challenging, including transferring the hairstyle of one subject to another in a potentially different pose, rendering the original portrait in a novel view and image-space hair editing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16705","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16705","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2583","fieldValue":"Chan, Timothy M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2583","fieldValue":" We answer a basic data structuring question (e.g., raised by Dietz and Raman [1991]): Can van Emde Boas trees be made persistent, without changing their asymptotic query\/update time? We present a (partially) persistent data structure that supports predecessor search in a set of integers in {1, ..., U} under an arbitrary sequence of n insertions and deletions, with O(log log U) expected query time and expected amortized update time, and O(n) space. The query bound is optimal in U for linear-space structures and improves previous near-O((log log $U)^2) methods. The same method solves a fundamental problem from computational geometry: point location in orthogonal planar subdivisions (where edges are vertical or horizontal). We obtain the first static data structure achieving O(log log U) worst-case query time and linear space. This result is again optimal in U for linear-space structures and improves the previous O((log log U)2$) method by de Berg et al. [1995]. The same result also holds for higher-dimensional subdivisions that are orthogonal binary space partitions, and for certain nonorthogonal planar subdivisions such as triangulations without small angles. Many geometric applications follow, including improved query times for orthogonal range reporting for dimensions â\u2030¥ 3 on the RAM. Our key technique is an interesting new van-Emde-Boas--style recursion that alternates between two strategies, both quite simple."}
