For example, time-series biological data can be used to construct dynamic genetic regulatory network models, which can be used to design intervention strategies to cure or manage major diseases. Also, copy number data can be used to determine the locations and extent of aberrations in chromosome sequences. Unfortunately, measured biological data are usually contaminated with errors that mask the important features in the data. Therefore, these noisy measurements need to be filtered to enhance their usefulness in practice. Wavelet-based multiscale filtering has been shown to be a powerful denoising tool. In this work, different batch as well as online multiscale filtering techniques are used to denoise biological data contaminated with white or colored noise. The performances of these techniques are demonstrated and compared to those of some conventional low-pass filters using two case studies. The first case study uses simulated dynamic metabolic data, while the second case study uses real copy number data. Simulation results show that significant improvement can be achieved using multiscale filtering over conventional filtering techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4836","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4837","fieldValue":" Gene translation is a central process in all living organisms. Developing a better understanding of this complex process may have ramifications to almost every biomedical discipline. Recently, Reuveni et al. proposed a new computational model of this process called the ribosome flow model (RFM). In this study, we show that the dynamical behavior of the RFM is relatively simple. There exists a unique equilibrium point e and every trajectory converges to e. Furthermore, convergence is monotone in the sense that the distance to e can never increase. This qualitative behavior is maintained for any feasible set of parameter values, suggesting that the RFM is highly robust. Our analysis is based on a contraction principle and the theory of monotone dynamical systems. These analysis tools may prove useful in studying other properties of the RFM as well as additional intracellular biological processes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4837","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4837","fieldValue":"Trajectory,Computational modeling,Mathematical model,Biological system modeling,Indexes,Vectors,Equations,tridiagonal cooperative systems.,Gene translation,systems biology,computational models,monotone dynamical systems"}
