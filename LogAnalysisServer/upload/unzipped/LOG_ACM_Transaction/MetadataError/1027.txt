{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14131","fieldValue":" In this paper we consider the communication complexity of maintaining the replicas of a logical data-item, in a database distributed over a computer network. We propose a new method, called the minimum spanning tree write, by which a processor in the network should multicast a write of a logical data-item, to all the processors that store replicas of the items. Then we show that the minimum spanning tree write is optimal from the communication cost point of view. We also demonstate that the method by which a write is multicast to all the replicas of a data-item affects the optimal replication scheme of the item, i.e., at which processors in the network the replicas should be located. Therefore, next we consider the problem of determining an optimal replicaiton scheme for a data item, assuming that each processor employs the minimum spanning tree write at run-time. The problem for general networks is shown NP-Complete, but we provide efficient algorithms to obtain an optimal allocation scheme for three common types of network topologies. They are completely-connected, tree, and ring networks. For these topologies, efficient algorithms are also provided for the case in which reliability considerations dictate a minimum number of replicas."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14131","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14131","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14132","fieldValue":" Nearly all query languages discussed recently for the Entity-Relationship (ER) model do not possess a formal semantics. Languages are often defined by means of examples only. The reason for this phenomenon is the essential gap between features of query languages and theoretical foundations like algebras and calculi. Known languages offer arithmetic capabilities and allow for aggregates, but algebras and calculi defined for ER models do not. This paper introduces an extended ER model concentrating nearly all concepts of known so-called semantic data models in a few syntactical constructs. Moreover, we provide our extended ER model with a formal mathematical semantics. On this basis a well-founded calculus is developed taking into account data operations on arbitrary user-defined data types and aggregate functions. We pay special attention to arithmetic operations, as well as multivalued terms allowing nested queries, in a uniform and consistent manner. We prove our calculus only allows the formulation of safe terms and queries yielding a finite result, and to be (at least) as expressive as the relational calculi."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2337","fieldValue":"Bar-Noy, Amotz"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2337","fieldValue":" We investigate deterministic algorithms for a frequency assignment problem in cellular networks. The problem can be modeled as a special vertex coloring problem for hypergraphs: In every hyperedge there must exist a vertex with a color that occurs exactly once in the hyperedge (the conflict-free property). We concentrate on a special case of the problem, called conflict-free coloring for intervals. We introduce a hierarchy of four models for the aforesaid problem: (i) static, (ii) dynamic offline, (iii) dynamic online with absolute positions, and (iv) dynamic online with relative positions. In the dynamic offline model, we give a deterministic algorithm that uses at most $log_3\/2 n + 1 &;approx; 1.71 log2 n colors and show inputs that force any algorithm to use at least 3 log5 n + 1 &approx; 1.29 log2 n colors. For the online absolute-positions model, we give a deterministic algorithm that uses at most 3‚åàlog3 n‚å\u2030 &approx; 1.89 log2$ n colors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic online algorithm using O(log n) colors in a nontrivial online model. In the online relative-positions model, we resolve an open problem by showing a tight analysis on the number of colors used by the first-fit greedy online algorithm. We also consider conflict-free coloring only with respect to intervals that contain at least one of the two extreme points."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2337","fieldValue":"ACM"}
