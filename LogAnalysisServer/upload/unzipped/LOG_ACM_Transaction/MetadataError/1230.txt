It works by injecting random noise into each query result such that it is provably hard for the adversary to infer the presence or absence of any individual record from the published noisy results. The main objective in differentially private query processing is to maximize the accuracy of the query results while satisfying the privacy guarantees. Previous work, notably Li et al. [2010], has suggested that, with an appropriate strategy, processing a batch of correlated queries as a whole achieves considerably higher accuracy than answering them individually. However, to our knowledge there is currently no practical solution to find such a strategy for an arbitrary query batch; existing methods either return strategies of poor quality (often worse than naive methods) or require prohibitively expensive computations for even moderately large domains. Motivated by this, we propose a low-rank mechanism (LRM), the first practical differentially private technique for answering batch linear queries with high accuracy. LRM works for both exact (i.e., &epsi;-) and approximate (i.e., (&epsi;, Î\u201D)-) differential privacy definitions. We derive the utility guarantees of LRM and provide guidance on how to set the privacy parameters, given the user's utility expectation. Extensive experiments using real data demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art query processing solutions under differential privacy, by large margins."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14660","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14660","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14661","fieldValue":" It is well established that extracting and annotating occurrences of entities in a collection of unstructured text documents with their concepts improves the effectiveness of answering queries over the collection. However, it is very resource intensive to create and maintain large annotated collections. Since the available resources of an enterprise are limited and\/or its users may have urgent information needs, it may have to select only a subset of relevant concepts for extraction and annotation. We call this subset a conceptual design for the annotated collection. In this article, we introduce and formally define the problem of cost-effective conceptual design where, given a collection, a set of relevant concepts, and a fixed budget, one likes to find a conceptual design that most improves the effectiveness of answering queries over the collection. We provide efficient algorithms for special cases of the problem and prove it is generally NP-hard in the number of relevant concepts. We propose three efficient approximations to solve the problem: a greedy algorithm, an approximate popularity maximization (APM for short), and approximate annotation-benefit maximization (AAM for short). We show that, if there are no constraints regrading the overlap of concepts, APM is a fully polynomial time approximation scheme. We also prove that if the relevant concepts are mutually exclusive, the greedy algorithm delivers a constant approximation ratio if the concepts are equally costly, APM has a constant approximation ratio, and AAM is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. Our empirical results using a Wikipedia collection and a search engine query log validate the proposed formalization of the problem and show that APM and AAM efficiently compute conceptual designs. They also indicate that, in general, APM delivers the optimal conceptual designs if the relevant concepts are not mutually exclusive. Also, if the relevant concepts are mutually exclusive, the conceptual designs delivered by AAM improve the effectiveness of answering queries over the collection more than the solutions provided by APM."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14661","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14661","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14662","fieldValue":"Jensen, Christian S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14662","fieldValue":" With the proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging techniques, spatio-textual objects that possess both a geographical location and a textual description are gaining in prevalence, and spatial keyword queries that exploit both location and textual description are gaining in prominence. However, the queries studied so far generally focus on finding individual objects that each satisfy a query rather than finding groups of objects where the objects in a group together satisfy a query. We define the problem of retrieving a group of spatio-textual objects such that the group's keywords cover the query's keywords and such that the objects are nearest to the query location and have the smallest inter-object distances. Specifically, we study three instantiations of this problem, all of which are NP-hard. We devise exact solutions as well as approximate solutions with provable approximation bounds to the problems. In addition, we solve the problems of retrieving top-k groups of three instantiations, and study a weighted version of the problem that incorporates object weights. We present empirical studies that offer insight into the efficiency of the solutions, as well as the accuracy of the approximate solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14662","fieldValue":"ACM"}
