The technique is a mixture of stochastic (density estimation) and deterministic (adaptive mesh refinement) algorithms used in a sequence and optimized to reduce the differences between the intermediate and final images as perceived by the human observer in the course of lighting computation. The quantitive measurements of visibility were obtained using the model of human vision captured in the visible differences predictor (VDP) developed by Daly [1993]. The VDP responses were used to support the selection of the best component algorithms from a pool of global illumination solutions, and to enhance the selected algorithms for even better progressive refinement of image quality. The VDP was also used to determine the optimal sequential order of component-algorithm execution, and to choose the points at which switchover between algorithms should take place. As the VDP is computationally expensive, it was applied exclusively at the design and tuning stage of the composite technique, and so perceptual considerations are embedded into the resulting solution, though no VDP calculations were performed during lighting simulation. The proposed illumination technique is also novel, providing intermediate image solutions of high quality at unprecedented speeds, even for complex scenes. One advantage of the technique is that local estimates of global illumination are readily available at the early stages of computing, making possible the development of a more robust adaptive mesh subdivision, which is guided by local contrast information. Efficient object space filtering, also based on stochastically-derived estimates of the local illumination error, is applied to substantially reduce the visible noise inherent in stochastic solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15185","fieldValue":"Using the visual differences predictor to improve performance of progressive global illumination computation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15185","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15185","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15186","fieldValue":" I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to take over as editor-in-chief after Holly Rushmeier's strong leadership of the past three years. ACM has made a big effort to get TOG back on schedule after the delays caused by changing to a new publication system. With this issue, we are almost on schedule again and the backlog of accepted papers is significantly reduced. I hope to further shorten the time the return reviews to authors and to get accepted paper to readers. As part of that effort, I have asked Steve Fortune for Bell Labs, John Hart from Washington State, Joe Marks from MERL, and Jorg Peters from the University of Florida to be new members of the editorial board to replace those who retired with the end of Holly's term.I expect that we'll see significant changes in the role of journals during my three-year term. Right now, journals utilize peer reviews and a revision cycle to provide accreditation to research, but this process is tied to a particular distribution medium and requires financial support in the form of subscription fees. With the increasing use of web-baed publishing, I expect that the accreditation and distribution functions will begin to separate. Accreditation will continue to play an important role in scientific reputations and academic careers, while the publication media will become far more diverse. This diversification is particularly important for graphics because many of its important results are not represented well on paper. TOG has moved in this direction with a web page that is expertly maintained by Eric Haines and contains occasional supplemental material (http:\/\/www.acm.org.\/tog\/). If TOG is to represent the true breadth of graphics, however, we will have to make much more of an effort in this direction.During the next three years, we will almost certainly see significant changes in graphics as well. Clearly, the field is expanding beyond the creation of beautiful and useful images and image sequences. New emphases include increasingly realistic physical modeling, interactive worlds, and nonvisual modalities. Graphics is a fascinating field, in part because researchers are able to adopt and adapt new ideas from so many other fields: art, vision, physics, materials science, control, optimization and biomechanics. I look forward to the innovative and creative work that the community will submit to TOG during the next three years."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15186","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15186","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15186","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15187","fieldValue":" A refined version of the texture potential mapping algorithm is introduced in which a one-dimensional MIP map is incorporated. This has the effect of controlling the maximum number of texture samples required. The new technique is compared to existing texture antialiasing methods in terms of quality and sample count. The new method is shown to compare favorably with existing techniques for producing high quality antialiased, texture-mapped images."}
