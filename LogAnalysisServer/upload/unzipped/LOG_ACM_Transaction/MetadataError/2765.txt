Some of these solvers were written primarily as research codes while others have been developed for commercial use. Our experiences of using the different packages to solve a wide range of problems arising from real applications were mixed. In this paper, we highlight some of these experiences with the aim of providing advice to both software developers and users of sparse direct solvers. We discuss key features that a direct solver should offer and conclude that while performance is an essential factor to consider when choosing a code, there are other features that a user should also consider looking for that vary significantly between packages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19174","fieldValue":"Beebe, Nelson H F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19174","fieldValue":" Integrals with logarithmic singularities are often difficult to evaluate by numerical methods. In this work, a quadrature method is developed that allows the exact evaluation (up to machine accuracy) of integrals of polynomials with two general types of logarithmic weights. The total work for the determination of N nodes and points of the quadrature method is $O(N^2$). Subsequently, integrals can be evaluated with O(N) operations and function evaluations, so the quadrature is efficient. This quadrature method can then be used to generate the nonclassical orthogonal polynomials for weight functions containing logarithms and obtain Gauss and Gauss-related quadratures for these weights. Two algorithms for each of the two types of logarithmic weights that incorporate these methods are given in this paper."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19174","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19174","fieldValue":"ACM"}
