Due to the explosive growth of the Web, the domain of Web personalization has gained great momentum both in the research and commercial areas. In this article we present a survey of the use of Web mining for Web personalization. More specifically, we introduce the modules that comprise a Web personalization system, emphasizing the Web usage mining module. A review of the most common methods that are used as well as technical issues that occur is given, along with a brief overview of the most popular tools and applications available from software vendors. Moreover, the most important research initiatives in the Web usage mining and personalization areas are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24275","fieldValue":"WWW"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24275","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24275","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24276","fieldValue":" This article investigates if and how mobile agents can execute secure electronic transactions on untrusted hosts. An overview of the security issues of mobile agents is first given. The problem of untrusted (i.e., potentially malicious) hosts is one of these issues, and appears to be the most difficult to solve. The current approaches to counter this problem are evaluated, and their relevance for secure electronic transactions is discussed. In particular, a state-of-the-art survey of mobile agent-based secure electronic transactions is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24276","fieldValue":"(How) can mobile agents do secure electronic transactions on untrusted hosts?
