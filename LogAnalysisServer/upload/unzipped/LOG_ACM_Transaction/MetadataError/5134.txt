In this paper, we study the design of beampatterns with multiple nulls in the same direction, which is clearly different from the design of beampatterns with distinct nulls. Our contributions are as follows. First, we show how to constrain multiple nulls to the same direction and design the desired beampattern with both the traditional and robust approaches. Second, we derive an explicit form of the white noise gain (WNG) of the traditional approach as a function of the frequency, interelement spacing, and null direction, which shows that the cardioid is the optimal beampattern as far as the WNG is concerned. Third, we prove that the WNG improvement of the robust approach rarely depends on the null direction at low frequencies. Finally, considering the fact that the robust differential beamforming approach may produce a frequency-dependent beampattern while improving the WNG, we develop a weighted-norm approach that can make a good compromise between the robustness of differential beamforming with respect to white noise and the frequency-invariant beampattern. The performance of the developed approach is verified by simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1306","fieldValue":" This article addresses the problem of self-tuning the data placement in replicated key-value stores. The goal is to automatically optimize replica placement in a way that leverages locality patterns in data accesses, such that internode communication is minimized. To do this efficiently is extremely challenging, as one needs not only to find lightweight and scalable ways to identify the right assignment of data replicas to nodes but also to preserve fast data lookup. The article introduces new techniques that address these challenges. The first challenge is addressed by optimizing, in a decentralized way, the placement of the objects generating the largest number of remote operations for each node. The second challenge is addressed by combining the usage of consistent hashing with a novel data structure, which provides efficient probabilistic data placement. These techniques have been integrated in a popular open-source key-value store. The performance results show that the throughput of the optimized system can be six times better than a baseline system employing the widely used static placement based on consistent hashing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3995","fieldValue":"Hung, Jeih-Weih"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3995","fieldValue":"Hsieh, Hsin-Ju"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3995","fieldValue":" The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel speech feature extraction framework for independently compensating the real and imaginary acoustic spectra of speech signals in the modulation domain with the techniques of histogram equalization (HEQ) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). By doing so, we can enhance not only the magnitude but also the phase components of the acoustic spectra, thereby creating noise-robust speech features. More specifically, the proposed framework makes the following three major contributions: First, via either of the HEQ and NMF operations, the long-term cross-frame correlation among the acoustic spectra at the same frequency can be captured to compensate for the spectral distortion caused by noise. Second, the noise effect can be handled in a high acoustic frequency resolution. Finally, the distortion dwelt in the acoustic spectra can be more extensively mitigated due to the independent processes for the respective real and imaginary parts. The evaluation experiments were carried out on the Aurora-2 and Aurora-4 benchmark tasks, and the corresponding results suggest that our proposed methods can achieve performance competitive to or better than many widely used noise robustness methods, including the well-known advanced front-end (AFE) extraction scheme, in speech recognition."}
