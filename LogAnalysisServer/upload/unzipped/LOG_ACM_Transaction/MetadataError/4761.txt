Detail-on-demand video is a form of hypervideo that supports one hyperlink at a time for navigating between video sequences. The Hyper-Hitchcock editor enables authoring of detail-on-demand video without programming and uses video processing to aid in the authoring process. The Hyper-Hitchcock player uses labels and keyframes to support navigation through and back hyperlinks. Hyper-Hitchcock includes techniques for automatically generating hypervideo summaries of one or more videos that take the form of multiple linear summaries of different lengths with links from the shorter to the longer summaries. User studies on authoring and viewing provided insight into the various roles of links in hypervideo and found that player interface design greatly affects people's understanding of hypervideo structure and the video they access."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25339","fieldValue":" The proliferation of multimedia applications over mobile, resource-constrained wireless networks has raised the need for techniques that adapt these applications both to clients' Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and to network resource constraints. This article investigates the upper-layer adaptation mechanisms to achieve end-to-end delay control for multimedia applications. The proposed adaptation approach spans application layer, middleware layer and network layer. In application layer, the requirement adaptor dynamically changes the requirement levels according to end-to-end delay measurement and acceptable QoS requirements for the end-users. In middleware layer, the priority adaptor is used to dynamically adjust the service classes for applications using feedback control theory. In network layer, the service differentiation scheduler assigns different network resources (e.g., bandwidth) to different service classes. With the coordination of these three layers, our approach can adaptively assign resources to multimedia applications. To evaluate the impact of our adaptation scheme, we built a real IEEE 802.11 ad hoc network testbed. The test-bed experiments show that the proposed upper-layer adaptation for end-to-end delay control successfully adjusts multimedia applications to meet delay requirements in many scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25340","fieldValue":" In this article, a novel criterion-based multilayer access control (CBMAC) approach is presented to enhance existing access control models such as Role-Based, Mandatory, and Discretionary Access Control models to support multilayer (multilevel) access control. The proposed approach is based on a set of predefined security criteria which are extracted from authorization rules. The security attributes of objects and users are specified by security criterion expressions (serving as locks) and the elements (serving as keys) of security criterion subsets respectively. An object embedded with a number of security criterion expressions becomes a secure object while a user associated with a security criterion subset is called a secure user. The multilayer access control is achieved by evaluating the embedded security criterion expressions (actuating locks) by the elements (keys) in a user's security criterion subset. The paper also provides the details of integrating the proposed approach with existing access control models and presents the implementation considerations of Criterion-Based Role-Based Multilayer Access Control, the integration of CBMAC and Role-Based Access Control."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25340","fieldValue":"A criterion-based multilayer access control approach for multimedia applications and the implementation considerations"}
