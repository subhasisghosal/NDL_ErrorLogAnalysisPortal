{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21712","fieldValue":" Elliptic curve cryptography has generated a lot of research interest due to its ability to provide greater security per bit compared to public key systems such as RSA. The designer of an elliptic curve hardware accelerator is faced with many choices at design time, each of which can impact the performance of the accelerator in different ways. There are many examples in the literature of how these design choices can effect the area and\/or speed of an elliptic curve hardware accelerator. The effect of design choices on power and energy consumption in elliptic curve hardware has been less well studied. This article studies the effect of design choices on the power and energy consumption of an FPGA-based reconfigurable elliptic curve hardware accelerator. A reconfigurable processor has been used for different system parameters and the power and energy consumption measured. The power and energy results are presented and compared."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21712","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3076","fieldValue":" A machine-readable bilingual dictionary plays a crucial role in many natural language processing tasks, such as statistical machine translation and cross-language information retrieval. In this article, we propose a framework for extracting a bilingual dictionary from comparable corpora by exploiting a novel combination of topic modeling and word aligners such as the IBM models. Using a multilingual topic model, we first convert a comparable document-aligned corpus into a parallel topic-aligned corpus. This novel topic-aligned corpus is similar in structure to the sentence-aligned corpus frequently employed in statistical machine translation and allows us to extract a bilingual dictionary using a word alignment model. The main advantages of our framework is that (1) no seed dictionary is necessary for bootstrapping the process, and (2) multilingual comparable corpora in more than two languages can also be exploited. In our experiments on a large-scale Wikipedia dataset, we demonstrate that our approach can extract higher precision dictionaries compared to previous approaches and that our method improves further as we add more languages to the dataset."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3076","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3076","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21713","fieldValue":"McEvoy, Robert P"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21713","fieldValue":"Murphy, Colin C"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21713","fieldValue":"Marnane, William P"}
