The algorithm combines a normalization stage, to remove channel dependency and to attenuate strong noise components, with a harmonic summing filter applied in the log-frequency power spectral domain, the impulse response of which is chosen to sum the energy of the fundamental frequency harmonics while attenuating smoothly-varying noise components. Temporal continuity constraints are applied to the selected pitch candidates and a voiced speech probability is computed from the likelihood ratio of two classifiers, one for voiced speech and one for unvoiced speech\/silence. We compare the performance of our algorithm with that of other widely used algorithms and demonstrate that it performs well in both high and low levels of additive noise."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3627","fieldValue":"Min Zhang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3627","fieldValue":"Xiangyu Duan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3627","fieldValue":"Wenliang Chen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3627","fieldValue":" Constituent Context Model (CCM) is an effective generative model for grammar induction, the aim of which is to induce hierarchical syntactic structure from natural text. The CCM simply defines the Multinomial distribution over constituents, which leads to a severe data sparse problem because long constituents are unlikely to appear in unseen data sets. This paper proposes a Bayesian method for constituent smoothing by defining two kinds of prior distributions over constituents: the Dirichlet prior and the Pitman-Yor Process prior. The Dirichlet prior functions as an additive smoothing method, and the PYP prior functions as a back-off smoothing method. Furthermore, a modified CCM is proposed to differentiate left constituents and right constituents in binary branching trees. Experiments show that both the proposed Bayesian smoothing method and the modified CCM are effective, and combining them attains or significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance of grammar induction evaluated on standard treebanks of various languages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3627","fieldValue":"ACM"}
