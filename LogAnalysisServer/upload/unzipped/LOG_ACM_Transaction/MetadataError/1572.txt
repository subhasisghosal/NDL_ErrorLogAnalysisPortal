{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15755","fieldValue":" To create a new, flexible system for volume illustration, we have explored the use of Wang Cubes, the 3D extension of 2D Wang Tiles. We use small sets of Wang Cubes to generate a large variety of nonperiodic illustrative 3D patterns and texture, which otherwise would be too large to use in real applications. We also develop a direct volume rendering framework with the generated patterns and textures. Our framework can be used to render volume datasets effectively and a variety of rendering styles can be achieved with less storage. Specifically, we extend the nonperiodic tiling process of Wang Tiles to Wang Cubes and modify it for multipurpose tiling. We automatically generate isotropic Wang Cubes consisting of 3D patterns or textures to simulate various illustrative effects. Anisotropic Wang Cubes are generated to yield patterns by using the volume data, curvature, and gradient information. We also extend the definition of Wang Cubes into a set of different sized cubes to provide multiresolution volume rendering. Finally, we provide both coherent 3D geometry-based and texture-based rendering frameworks that can be integrated with arbitrary feature exploration methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15755","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15755","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15756","fieldValue":" Multibody dynamics are used in interactive and real-time applications, ranging from computer games to virtual prototyping, and engineering. All these areas strive towards faster and larger scale simulations. Particularly challenging are large-scale simulations with highly organized and structured stacking. We present a stable, robust, and versatile method for multibody dynamics simulation. Novel contributions include a new, explicit, fixed time-stepping scheme for velocity-based complementarity formulations using shock propagation with a simple reliable implementation strategy for an iterative complementarity problem solver specifically optimized for multibody dynamics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15756","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15756","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15757","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15757","fieldValue":" Taking satisfactory photos under dim lighting conditions using a hand-held camera is challenging. If the camera is set to a long exposure time, the image is blurred due to camera shake. On the other hand, the image is dark and noisy if it is taken with a short exposure time but with a high camera gain. By combining information extracted from both blurred and noisy images, however, we show in this paper how to produce a high quality image that cannot be obtained by simply denoising the noisy image, or deblurring the blurred image alone. Our approach is image deblurring with the help of the noisy image. First, both images are used to estimate an accurate blur kernel, which otherwise is difficult to obtain from a single blurred image. Second, and again using both images, a residual deconvolution is proposed to significantly reduce ringing artifacts inherent to image deconvolution. Third, the remaining ringing artifacts in smooth image regions are further suppressed by a gain-controlled deconvolution process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a number of indoor and outdoor images taken by off-the-shelf hand-held cameras in poor lighting environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15757","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15757","fieldValue":"ACM"}
