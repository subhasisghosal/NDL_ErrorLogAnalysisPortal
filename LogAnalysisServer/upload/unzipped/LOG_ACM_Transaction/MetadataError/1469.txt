Our approach makes use of a novel family of tilings, called \"inflation tilings,\" which are particularly well suited as guides for creating star patterns. We describe a method for creating a parameterized set of motifs that can be used to fill the many regular polygons that comprise these tilings, as well as an algorithm to infer geometry for any irregular polygons that remain. Erasing the underlying tiling and joining together the inferred motifs produces the star patterns. By choice, Najm is build upon the subset of geometry that makes no assumption about the behavior of parallel lines. As a consequence, star patterns created by Najm can be designed equally well to fit the Euclidean plane, the hyperbolic plane, or the surface of a sphere."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15491","fieldValue":" Subsurface scattering is important for photo-realistic rendering of translucent materials. We make approximations to the BSSRDF model and propose a simple lighting model to simulate the effects on translucent meshes. Our approximations are based on the observation that subsurface scattering is relatively local due to its exponential falloff.In the preprocessing stage we build subsurface scattering neighborhood information, which includes all the vertices within effective scattering range from each vertex. We then modify the traditional local illumination model into a run-time two-stage process. The first stage involves computation of reflection and transmission of light on surface vertices. The second stage bleeds in scattering effects from a vertex's neighborhood to generate the final result. We then merge the run-time two-stage process into a run-time single-stage process using precomputed integrals, and reduce the complexity of our run-time algorithm to O(N), where N is the number of vertices. The selection of the optimum set size for precomputed integrals is guided by a standard imagespace error-metric. Furthermore, we show how to compress the precomputed integrals using spherical harmonics. We compensate for the inadequacy of spherical harmonics for storing high frequency components by a reference points scheme to store high frequency components of the precomputed integrals explicitly. With this approach, we greatly reduce memory usage without loss of visual quality under a high-frequency lighting environment and achieve interactive frame rates for medium-sized scenes. Our model is able to capture the most important features of subsurface scattering: reflection and transmission due to multiple scattering."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15491","fieldValue":"BSSRDF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15492","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15492","fieldValue":"Tang, Chi-Keung"}
