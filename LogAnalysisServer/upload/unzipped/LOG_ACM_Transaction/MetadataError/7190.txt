{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9200","fieldValue":" Packet Scale Rate Guarantee (PSRG) is a generic node model which underlies the definition of Expedited Forwarding (EF) proposed in the context of Internet Differentiated Services. For the case of first-in-first-out (FIFO) nodes, PSRG is equivalent to the well-understood concept of adaptive service curve. However, in practice, many devices do not necessarily preserve the FIFO property, and therefore, known FIFO results do not hold. This paper analyzes the properties of PSRG in the absence of FIFO assumption. Our analysis is based on a novel characterization of PSRG which avoids the use of virtual finish times and is obtained by min-max algebra. We use it to show that delay bounds previously obtained for the FIFO case are still valid; in contrast, we find that this is not true for the characterization of the concatenation of two nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9200","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9200","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9200","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9201","fieldValue":"van Uitert, Miranda"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9201","fieldValue":" We consider a queue fed by a mixture of light-tailed and heavy-tailed traffic. The two traffic flows are served in accordance with the generalized processor sharing (GPS) discipline. GPS-based scheduling algorithms, such as weighted fair queueing, have emerged as an important mechanism for achieving service differentiation in integrated networks. We derive the asymptotic workload behavior of the light-tailed traffic flow under the assumption that its GPS weight is larger than its traffic intensity. The GPS mechanism ensures that the workload is bounded above by that in an isolated system with the light-tailed flow served in isolation at a constant rate equal to its GPS weight. We show that the workload distribution is in fact asymptotically equivalent to that in the isolated system, multiplied with a certain pre-factor, which accounts for the interaction with the heavy-tailed flow. Specifically, the pre-factor represents the probability that the heavy-tailed flow is backlogged long enough for the light-tailed flow to reach overflow. The results provide crucial qualitative insight in the typical overflow scenario."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9201","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9202","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present three algorithms that provide performance guarantees for scheduling switches, such as optical switches, with configuration overhead. Each algorithm emulates an unconstrained (zero overhead) switch by accumulating a batch of configuration requests and generating a corresponding schedule for a constrained switch. Speedup is required both to cover the configuration overhead of the switch and to compensate for empty slots left by the scheduling algorithm. Scheduling algorithms are characterized by the number of configurations Ns they require to cover a batch of requests and the speedup required to compensate for empty slots Smin. Initially, all switch reconfiguration is assumed to occur simultaneously. We show that a well-known exact matching algorithm, EXACT, leaves no empty slots (i.e., Smin = 1), but requires Ns â\u2030ˆ $N^2$ configurations for an N-port switch leading to high configuration overhead or large batches and, hence, high delay. We present two new algorithms that reduce the number of configurations required substantially. MIN covers a batch of requests in the minimum possible number of configurations, Ns = N, but at the expense of many empty slots, Smin â\u2030ˆ 4log2 N. DOUBLE strikes a balance, requiring twice as many configurations,Ns = 2N, while reducing the number of empty slots so that Smin = 2. Loosening the restriction on reconfiguration times, the scheduling problem is cast as an open shop. The best known practical scheduling algorithm for open shops, list scheduling (LIST), gives the same emulation requirements as DOUBLE. Therefore, we conclude that our architecture gains no advantages from allowing arbitrary switch reconfiguration. Finally, we show that DOUBLE and LIST offer the lowest required speedup to emulate an unconstrained switch across a wide range of port count and delay."}
