It consists of analytic sequent calculi where the details of nonmonotonic assumption making are modelled by an axiomatic rejection method. Another distinctive feature of the calculi is the use of provability constraints that make reasoning largely independent of any specific derivation strategy. The resulting account of nonmonotonic inference is simple and flexible enough to be a promising playground for investigating and comparing proof strategies, and for describing the behavior of automated reasoning systems. We provide some preliminary evidence for this claim by introducing optimized calculi, and by simulating an existing tableaux-based method for circumscription. The calculi for skeptical reasoning support concise proofs that may depend on a strict subset of the given theory. This is a difficult task, given the nonmonotonic behavior of the logics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11372","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11372","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11373","fieldValue":" Abstract computable functions are defined by abstract finitedeterministic algorithms on many-sorted algebras. We show thatthere exist finite universal algebraic specifications that specifyuniquely (up to isomorphism) (i) all abstract computable functionson any many-sorted algebra; (ii) all functions effectivelyapproximable by abstract computable functions on any metricalgebra. We show that there exist universal algebraicspecifications for all the classically computable functions on theset â\u201E? of real numbers. The algebraic specifications used aremainly bounded universal equations and conditional equations. Weinvestigate the initial algebra semantics of these specifications,and derive situations where algebraic specifications preciselydefine the computable functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11374","fieldValue":" This special issue of ACM Transactions on Computational Logic is devoted to papers first presented at LICS 2000, the 15th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, held June 26--29, 2000, in Santa Barbara, California.In consultation with the LICS 2000 program committee, the guest editors selected five papers presented at the conference and invited their authors to submit full versions of the papers to this special issue. All submissions were refereed according to the usual standards of ACM Transactions on Computational Logic. They cover a range of lively areas within Logic in Computer Science, reflecting well the quality of the conference. We are grateful to the authors of the papers for their excellent contributions, and to all members of the program committee and reviewers for their efforts."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11374","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11374","fieldValue":"ACM"}
