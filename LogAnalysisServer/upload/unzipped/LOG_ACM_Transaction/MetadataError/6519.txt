{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7377","fieldValue":" The availability of large-scale images from the Internet has made the research on image search attract a lot of attention. Text-based image search engines, for example, Google\/Microsoft Bing\/Yahoo! image search engines using the surrounding text, have been developed and widely used. However, they suffer from an inability to search image content. In this article, we present an interactive image search system, image search by color map, which can be applied to, but not limited to, enhance text-based image search. This system enables users to indicate how the colors are spatially distributed in the desired images, by scribbling a few color strokes, or dragging an image and highlighting a few regions of interest in an intuitive way. In contrast to the conventional sketch-based image retrieval techniques, our system searches images based on colors rather than shapes, and we, technically, propose a simple but effective scheme to mine the latent search intention from the userâ\u20AC™s input, and exploit the dominant color filter strategy to make our system more efficient. We integrate our system to existing Web image search engines to demonstrate its superior performance over text-based image search. The user study shows that our system can indeed help users conveniently find desired images."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7378","fieldValue":" Cross-lingual adaptation is a special case of domain adaptation and refers to the transfer of classification knowledge between two languages. In this article we describe an extension of Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL), a recently proposed algorithm for domain adaptation, for cross-lingual adaptation in the context of text classification. The proposed method uses unlabeled documents from both languages, along with a word translation oracle, to induce a cross-lingual representation that enables the transfer of classification knowledge from the source to the target language. The main advantages of this method over existing methods are resource efficiency and task specificity. We conduct experiments in the area of cross-language topic and sentiment classification involving English as source language and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. The results show a significant improvement of the proposed method over a machine translation baseline, reducing the relative error due to cross-lingual adaptation by an average of 30&percnt; (topic classification) and 59&percnt; (sentiment classification). We further report on empirical analyses that reveal insights into the use of unlabeled data, the sensitivity with respect to important hyperparameters, and the nature of the induced cross-lingual word correspondences."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7378","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7378","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7379","fieldValue":"Broder, Andrei Z"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7379","fieldValue":" Contextual advertising is a type of Web advertising, which, given the URL of a Web page, aims to embed into the page the most relevant textual ads available. For static pages that are displayed repeatedly, the matching of ads can be based on prior analysis of their entire content; however, often ads need to be matched to new or dynamically created pages that cannot be processed ahead of time. Analyzing the entire content of such pages on-the-fly entails prohibitive communication and latency costs. To solve the three-horned dilemma of either low relevance or high latency or high load, we propose to use text summarization techniques paired with external knowledge (exogenous to the page) to craft short page summaries in real time. Empirical evaluation proves that matching ads on the basis of such summaries does not sacrifice relevance, and is competitive with matching based on the entire page content. Specifically, we found that analyzing a carefully selected 6&percnt; fraction of the page text can sacrifice only 1&percnt;--3&percnt; in ad relevance. Furthermore, our summaries are fully compatible with the standard JavaScript mechanisms used for ad placement: they can be produced at ad-display time by simple additions to the usual script, and they only add 500--600 bytes to the usual request. We also compared our summarization approach, which is based on structural properties of the HTML content of the page, with a more principled one based on one of the standard text summarization tools (MEAD), and found their performance to be comparable."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7379","fieldValue":"ACM"}
