The presence of flaws in published protocols highlights the complexity of security protocol design. Only formal verification can provide strong confidence in the correctness of security protocols and is considered an imperative step in their design. This paper presents a new theoretical concept, called Layered Proving Trees, for automatically applying logical postulates in logic-based security protocol verification.An algorithm for the new concept is introduced and the soundness and completeness of the technique is proved. Empirical results on the performance of the algorithm are presented. The presented proofs and empirical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the Layered Proving Tree approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22192","fieldValue":"The concept of layered proving trees and its application to the automation of security protocol verification"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22193","fieldValue":" Keystroke dynamics can be useful to ascertain personal identity even after an authentication phase has been passed, provided that we are able to deal with the typing rhythms of free text, chosen and entered by users without any specific constraint. In this paper we present a method to compare typing samples of free text that can be used to verify personal identity. We have tested our technique with a wide set of experiments on 205 individuals, obtaining a False Alarm Rate of less than 5&percent; and an Impostor Pass Rate of less than 0.005&percent;. Different trade-offs are, however, possible. Our approach can rely on what is typed by people because of their normal job, and a few lines of text, even collected in different working sessions, are sufficient to reach a high level of accuracy, which improves proportionally to the amount of available information: As a consequence, we argue that our method can be useful in computer security as a complementary or alternative way to user authentication and as an aid to intrusion detection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22194","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22194","fieldValue":"ACM"}
