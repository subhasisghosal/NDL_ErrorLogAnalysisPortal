Steady-state performance measures associated with these networks is often a topic of interset. Conceptually, under mild conditions, a sequence of regeneration times exists in multiclass networks, making them amenable to regenerative simulation for estimating steady-state performance measures. However, typically, identification of such a sequence in these networks is difficult. A well-known exception is when all interarrival times are exponentially distributed, where the instants corresponding to customer arrivals to an empty network constitute a sequence of regeneration times. In this article, we consider networks in which the interarrival times are generally distributed but have exponential or heavier tails. We show that these distributions can be decomposed into a mixture of sums of independent random variables such that at least one of the components is exponentially distributed. This allows an easily implementable embedded sequence of regeneration times in the underlying Markov process. We show that among all such interarrival time decompositions, the one with an exponential component that has the largest mean minimizes the asymptotic variance of the standard deviation estimator. We also show that under mild conditions on the network primitives, the regenerative mean and standard deviation estimators are consistent and satisfy a joint central limit theorem useful for constructing asymptotically valid confidence intervals."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25133","fieldValue":"Calvin, James M"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25133","fieldValue":"Nakayama, Marvin K"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25133","fieldValue":" We discuss some estimators for simulations of processes having multiple regenerative sequences. The estimators are obtained by resampling trajectories without and with replacement, which correspond to a type of U-statistic and a type of V-statistic, respectively. The U-statistic estimator turns out to be equivalent to the permuted regenerative estimator, which we previously proposed, but the V-statistic estimator is new. We compare analytically some properties of these estimators and the semiregenerative estimator. We show that when estimating the second moment of a cycle reward, the semiregenerative estimator has positive bias, which is strictly larger than the (positive) bias of the V-statistic estimator. The permuted estimator is unbiased. All of the estimators have the same asymptotic central limit behavior, with reduced asymptotic variance compared to the standard regenerative estimator. Some numerical results are included."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25133","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25133","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25134","fieldValue":"Kim, Song-Hee"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25134","fieldValue":" The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test is commonly used to determine if data can be regarded as a sample from a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with specified continuous cumulative distribution function (cdf) F, but with small samples it can have insufficient power, that is, its probability of rejecting natural alternatives can be too low. However, in 1961, Durbin showed that the power of the KS test often can be increased, for a given significance level, by a well-chosen transformation of the data. Simulation experiments reported here show that the power can often be more consistently and substantially increased by a different transformation. We first transform the given sequence to a sequence of mean-1 exponential random variables, which is equivalent to a rate-1 Poisson process. We then apply the classical conditional-uniform transformation to convert the arrival times into i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. And then, after those two preliminary steps, we apply the original Durbin transformation. Since these KS tests assume a fully specified cdf, we also investigate the consequence of having to estimate parameters of the cdf."}
