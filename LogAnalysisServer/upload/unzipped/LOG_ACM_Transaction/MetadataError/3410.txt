The characteristic of a multi-hop Real-Time Wireless Sensor Network raises new challenges. First, the constraints are more complicated and a new solution method is needed. Second, a distributed solution is needed to achieve scalability. This article presents solutions to both of the new challenges. The first solution to the optimal rate allocation is a centralized solution that can handle the more general form of constraints as compared with prior research. The second solution is a distributed version for large sensor networks using a pricing scheme. It is capable of incremental adjustment when utility functions change. This article also presents a new sensor device\/network backbone architecture---Real-time Independent CHannels (RICH), which can easily realize multi-hop real-time wireless sensor networking."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3020","fieldValue":" Despite being spoken by a large percentage of the world, Indic languages in general lack user-friendly and efficient methods for text input. These languages have poor or no support for typing. Soft keyboards, because of their ease of installation and lack of reliance on specific hardware, are a promising solution as an input device for many languages. Developing an acceptable soft keyboard requires the frequency analysis of characters in order to design a layout that minimizes text-input time. This article proposes the use of various development techniques, layout variations, and evaluation methods for the creation of soft keyboards for Brahmic scripts. We propose that using optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms and multi-objective Pareto optimization to develop multi-layer keyboards will increase the speed at which text can be entered."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3020","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3020","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21193","fieldValue":" We present a procedure for communication power optimization in a network of randomly distributed sensors with an observer (data collector) moving on a fixed path. The key challenge in using a mobile observer is that it remains within communication range of any sensor for a brief duration, and inability to transfer data in this duration leads to data loss. We establish that the process of data collection can be modeled by a queue with deadlines, where arrivals correspond to the observer entering the range of a sensor and a missed deadline means data loss. The queuing model is then used to identify the combination of system parameters that ensures adequate data collection with minimum power. The results obtained from the queuing analogy take a simple form in the asymptotic regime of dense sensor networks. Additionally, for sensor networks that cannot tolerate data loss, we derive a tight bound on minimum sensor separation that ensures that no data will be lost on account of mobility. We present two examples to illustrate our results, from which it is seen that power reduction by two orders of magnitude or more is typical relative to a static sensor network. The scenarios chosen for power comparisons also provide guidelines on the choice of path, if such a choice is available."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21194","fieldValue":" We study the problem of coverage in planar heterogeneous sensor networks. Coverage is a performance metric that quantifies how well a field of interest is monitored by the sensor deployment. To derive analytical expressions of coverage for heterogeneous sensor networks, we formulate the coverage problem as a set intersection problem, a problem studied in integral geometry. Compared to previous analytical results, our formulation allows us to consider a network model where sensors are deployed according to an arbitrary stochastic distribution; sensing areas of sensors need not follow the unit disk model but can have any arbitrary shape; sensors need not have an identical sensing capability. Furthermore, our formulation does not assume deployment of sensors over an infinite plane and, hence, our derivations do not suffer from the border effect problem arising in a bounded field of interest. We compare our theoretical results with the spatial Poisson approximation that is widely used in modeling coverage. By computing the Kullback-Leibler and total variation distance between the probability density functions derived via our theoretical results, the Poisson approximation, and the simulation, we show that our formulas provide a more accurate representation of the coverage in sensor networks. Finally, we provide examples of calculating network parameters such as the network size and sensing range in order to achieve a desired degree of coverage."}
