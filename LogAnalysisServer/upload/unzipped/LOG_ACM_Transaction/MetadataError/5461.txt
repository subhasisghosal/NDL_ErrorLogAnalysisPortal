Detecting the immunogenic region of the antigen is useful in numerous immunodetection and immunotherapeutics applications. The aim of this paper is to find relevant properties to discriminate the location of potential epitopes from the rest of the protein surface. The most relevant properties, identified using two evaluation approaches, are the geometric properties, followed by the conservation score and some chemical properties, such as the proportion of glycine. The selected properties are used in a patch-based epitope localization method including a Single-Layer Perceptron for regression. The output of this Single-Layer Perceptron is used to construct a probability map on the antigen surface. The predictive performances of the method are assessed by computing the AUC using cross validation on two benchmark data sets and by computing the AUC and the precision for a third independent test set."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4687","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4688","fieldValue":" In protein tertiary structure prediction, a crucial step is to select near-native structures from a large number of predicted structural models. Over the years, extensive research has been conducted for the protein structure selection problem with most approaches focusing on developing more accurate energy or scoring functions. Despite significant advances in this area, the discerning power of current approaches is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel consensus-based algorithm for the selection of predicted protein structures. Given a set of predicted models, our method first removes redundant structures to derive a subset of reference models. Then, a structure is ranked based on its average pairwise similarity to the reference models. Using the CASP8 data set containing a large collection of predicted models for 122 targets, we compared our method with the best CASP8 quality assessment (QA) servers, which are all consensus based, and showed that our QA scores correlate better with the GDT-TSs than those of the CASP8 QA servers. We also compared our method with the state-of-the-art scoring functions and showed its improved performance for near-native model selection. The GDT-TSs of the top models picked by our method are on average more than 8 percent better than the ones selected by the best performing scoring function."}
