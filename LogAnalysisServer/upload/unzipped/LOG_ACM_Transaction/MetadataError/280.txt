This shows that the simple counting argument that any formula refutable in width w must have a proof in size nO(w)$ is essentially tight. Moreover, our lower bound generalizes to polynomial calculus resolution and Sherali-Adams, implying that the corresponding size upper bounds in terms of degree and rank are tight as well. The lower bound does not extend all the way to Lasserre, however, since we show that there the formulas we study have proofs of constant rank and size polynomial in both n and w."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11787","fieldValue":"PCR"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11787","fieldValue":"SAR"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11788","fieldValue":" Recently, belief change within the framework of fragments of propositional logic has gained increasing attention. Previous research focused on belief contraction and belief revision on the Horn fragment. However, the problem of belief merging within fragments of propositional logic has been mostly neglected so far. We present a general approach to defining new merging operators derived from existing ones such that the result of merging remains in the fragment under consideration. Our approach is not limited to the case of Horn fragment; it is applicable to any fragment of propositional logic characterized by a closure property on the sets of models of its formulæ. We study the logical properties of the proposed operators regarding satisfaction of merging postulates, considering, in particular, distance-based merging operators for Horn and Krom fragments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11788","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11788","fieldValue":"ACM"}
