In this paper, a new congestion control scheme called TCP-Peach is introduced for satellite networks. TCP-Peach is composed of two new algorithms, namely Sudden Start and Rapid Recovery, as well as the two traditional TCP algorithms, Congestion Avoidance and Fast Retransmit. The new algorithms are based on the novel concept of using dummy segments to probe the availability of network resources without carrying any new information to the sender. Dummy segments are treated as low-priority segments and accordingly they do not effect the delivery of actual data traffic. Simulation experiments show that TCP-Peach outperforms other TCP schemes for satellite networks in terms of goodput. It also provides a fair share of network resources."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9028","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9028","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9028","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9029","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present a novel control-theoretic explicit rate (ER) allocation algorithm for the MAX-MIN flow control of elastic traffic services with minimum rate guarantee in the setting of the ATM available bit rate (ABR) service. The proposed ER algorithm is simple in that the number of operations required to compute it at a switch is minimized, scalable in that per-virtual-circuit (VC) operations including per-VC queueing, per VC accounting, and per-VC state management are virtually removed, and stable in that by employing it, the user transmission rates and the network queues are asymptotically stabilized at a unique equilibrium point at which MAX-MIN fairness with minimum rate guarantee and target queue lengths are achieved, respectively. To improve the speed of convergence, we normalize the controller gains of the algorithm by the estimate of the number of locally bottle-necked VCs. The estimation scheme is also computationally simple and scalable since it does not require per-VC accounting either. We verify its agreement with the practical performance through simulations in the case of multiple bottleneck nodes. We believe that the proposed algorithm will serve as an encouraging solution to the MAX-MIN flow control of elastic traffic services, the deployment of which has been debated long due to their lack of theoretical foundation and implementation complexity."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9029","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9029","fieldValue":"A simple, scalable, and stable explicit rate allocation algorithm for MAX-MIN flow control with minimum rate guarantee"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9029","fieldValue":"ACM"}
