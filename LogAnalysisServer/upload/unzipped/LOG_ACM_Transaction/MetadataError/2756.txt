The parameter m is a real number such that âˆ\u2018i Î½i &plus; m > âˆ\u20191 and the coefficients ai are strictly positive real numbers. The main ingredients in this algorithm are the well-known asymptotic expansion for JÎ½i$(x) and the observation that the infinite part of the integral can be approximated using the incomplete Gamma function Î\u201C(a,z). Accurate error estimates are included in the algorithm, which is implemented as a MATLAB program."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19151","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19151","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2853","fieldValue":" Automatic extraction and reasoning over temporal properties in natural language discourse has not had wide use in practical systems due to its demand for a rich and compositional, yet inference-friendly, representation of time. Motivated by our study of temporal expressions from the Penn Treebank corpora, we address the problem by proposing a two-level constraint-based framework for processing and reasoning over temporal information in natural language. Within this framework, temporal expressions are viewed as partial assignments to the variables of an underlying calendar constraint system, and multiple expressions together describe a temporal constraint-satisfaction problem (TCSP). To support this framework, we designed a typed formal language for encoding natural language expressions. The language can cope with phenomena such as under-specification and granularity change. The constraint problems can be solved using various constraint propagation and search methods, and the solutions can then be used to answer a wide range of time-related queries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2853","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2853","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19152","fieldValue":" BABDCR is a package of Fortran 90 subroutines for the solution of linear systems with bordered almost block diagonal coefficient matrices. It is designed to handle matrices with blocks of the same size, that is, having a block upper bidiagonal structure with an additional block in the right upper corner. The algorithm implemented in the package performs cyclic reduction of the coefficient matrix in order to reduce the fill-in due to the corner block."}
