In this paper, we develop explicit recursive representations for multiserver tandem queues with blocking. We demonstrate the application of these recursive representations with simulations of large-scale tandem queueing networks. We compare the computational efficiency of these representations with two other popular discrete-event simulation approaches, namely, event scheduling and process interaction. Experimental results show that these representations are seven (or more) times faster than their counterparts based on the event-scheduling and process-interaction approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25009","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25009","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25010","fieldValue":" The design, visualization, manipulation, and implementation of models for computer simulation are key parts of the discipline. Models are constructed as a means to understand physical phenomena as state changes occur over time. One issue that arises is the need to correlate models and their components with the phenomena being modeled. For example, a part of an automotive engine needs to be placed into cognitive context with the diagrammatic icon that represents that part's function. A typical solution to this problem is to display a dynamic model of the engine in one window and the engine's CAD model in another. Users are expected to, on their own, mentally blend the dynamic model and the physical phenomenon into the same context. However, this contextualization is not trivial in many applications. Our approach expands upon this form of user interaction by specifying two ways in which dynamic models and the corresponding physical phenomena may be viewed, and experimented with, within the same human interaction space. We present a methodology and implementation of contextualization for diagram-based dynamic models using an anesthesia machine, and then follow up with a human study of its effects on spatial cognition."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25010","fieldValue":"A mixed reality approach for interactively blending dynamic models with corresponding physical phenomena"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25011","fieldValue":"Son, Young-Jun"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25011","fieldValue":" An integrated Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) modeling framework is proposed for human decision making and planning for evacuation scenarios, whose submodules are based on a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), Decision-Field-Theory (DFT), and a Probabilistic Depth-First Search (PDFS) technique. A key novelty of the proposed model is its ability to represent both the human decision-making and decision-planning functions in a unified framework. To mimic realistic human behaviors, attributes of the BDI framework are reverse-engineered from human-in-the-loop experiments conducted in the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). The proposed modeling framework is demonstrated for a human's evacuation behaviors in response to a terrorist bomb attack. The simulated environment and agents (models of humans) conforming to the proposed BDI framework are implemented in AnyLogicÂ® agent-based simulation software, where each agent calls external Netica BBN software to perform its perceptual processing function and Soar software to perform its real-time planning and decision-execution functions. The constructed simulation has been used to test the impact of several factors (e.g., demographics, number of police officers, information sharing via speakers) on evacuation performance (e.g., average evacuation time, percentage of casualties)."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25011","fieldValue":"BDI"}
