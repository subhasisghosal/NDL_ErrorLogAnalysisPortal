The key idea in our method, based on biology, is the following. We considered the common decision-making mechanism in fish that allows them to instantly decide \"where and how to swim.\" The unified motion planner comprises two stages. In the first stage, where to swim to is decided. Using a probability distribution generated by integrating the perceptual information, the short-term target position and target speed are decided. In the second stage, how to swim is decided. A style of swimming that matches the information for transitioning from the current speed to the target speed is selected. Using the proposed method, we demonstrate 12 types of CG models with completely different sizes and skeletal structures, such as manta ray, tuna, and boxfish, as well as a scene where a school of a few thousand fish swim realistically. Our method is easy to integrate into existing graphics pipelines. In addition, in our method, the movement characteristics can easily be changed by adjusting the parameters. The method also has a feature where the expression of an entire school of fish, such as tornado or circling, can be designated top-down."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17568","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17568","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17569","fieldValue":"van de Panne, Michiel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17569","fieldValue":" Reinforcement learning offers a promising methodology for developing skills for simulated characters, but typically requires working with sparse hand-crafted features. Building on recent progress in deep reinforcement learning (DeepRL), we introduce a mixture of actor-critic experts (MACE) approach that learns terrain-adaptive dynamic locomotion skills using high-dimensional state and terrain descriptions as input, and parameterized leaps or steps as output actions. MACE learns more quickly than a single actor-critic approach and results in actor-critic experts that exhibit specialization. Additional elements of our solution that contribute towards efficient learning include Boltzmann exploration and the use of initial actor biases to encourage specialization. Results are demonstrated for multiple planar characters and terrain classes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17569","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17569","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17570","fieldValue":"van de Panne, Michiel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17570","fieldValue":" High quality locomotion is key to achieving believable character animation, but is often modeled as a generic stepping motion between two locations. In practice, locomotion often has task-specific characteristics and can exhibit a rich vocabulary of step types, including side steps, toe pivots, heel pivots, and intentional foot slides. We develop a model for such types of behaviors, based on task-specific foot-step plans that act as motion templates. The footstep plans are invoked and optimized at interactive rates and then serve as the basis for producing full body motion. We demonstrate the production of high-quality motions for three tasks: whiteboard writing, moving boxes, and sitting behaviors. The model enables retargeting to characters of varying proportions by yielding motion plans that are appropriately tailored to these proportions. We also show how the task effort or duration can be taken into account, yielding coarticulation behaviors."}
