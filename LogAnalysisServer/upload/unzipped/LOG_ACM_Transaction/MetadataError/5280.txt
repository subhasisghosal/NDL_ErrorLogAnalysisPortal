Generally speaking, two residue positions areconsidered coupled if, in the sequence record, some of theiramino acid type combinations are significantly more commonthan others. While the proposed approaches have proven useful infinding and describing coupling, a significant missing componentis a formal probabilistic model that explicates and compactlyrepresents the coupling, integrates information about sequence,structure, and function, and supports inferential procedures foranalysis, diagnosis, and prediction.We present an approach to learning and using probabilisticgraphical models of residue coupling. These models capturesignificant conservation and coupling constraints observable ina multiply-aligned set of sequences. Our approach can place astructural prior on considered couplings, so that all identifiedrelationships have direct mechanistic explanations. It can alsoincorporate information about functional classes, and therebylearn a differential graphical model that distinguishes constraintscommon to all classes from those unique to individual classes.Such differential models separately account for class-specificconservation and family-wide coupling, two different sourcesof sequence covariation. They are then able to perform interpretablefunctional classification of new sequences, explainingclassification decisions in terms of the underlying conservationand coupling constraints. We apply our approach in studies ofboth G protein-coupled receptors and PDZ domains, identifyingand analyzing family-wide and class-specific constraints, andperforming functional classification. The results demonstrate thatgraphical models of residue coupling provide a powerful toolfor uncovering, representing, and utilizing significant sequencestructure-function relationships in protein families."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4350","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4350","fieldValue":"Correlated mutations, graphical models, evolutionary covariation, sequence-structure-function relationships, functional classification"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4351","fieldValue":"Mena-Chalco, Jesus"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4351","fieldValue":"Cesar Jr, Roberto M."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4351","fieldValue":" An important topic in genomic sequence analysis is the identification of protein coding regions. In this context, several coding DNA model-independent methods, based on the occurrence of specific patterns of nucleotides at coding regions, have been proposed. Nonetheless, these methods have not been completely suitable due to their dependence on an empirically pre-defined window length required for a local analysis of a DNA region. We introduce a method, based on a modified Gabor-wavelet transform (MGWT), for the identification of protein coding regions. This novel transform is tuned to analyze periodic signal components and presents the advantage of being independent of the window length. We compared the performance of the MGWT with other methods using eukaryote datasets. The results show that the MGWT outperforms all assessed model-independent methods with respect to identification accuracy. These results indicate that the source of at least part of the identification errors produced by the previous methods is the fixed working scale. The new method not only avoids this source of errors, but also makes available a tool for detailed exploration of the nucleotide occurrence."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4351","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
