{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15647","fieldValue":" We introduce a novel method for the construction of discrete conformal mappings from surface meshes of arbitrary topology to the plane. Our approach is based on circle patterns, that is, arrangements of circles---one for each face---with prescribed intersection angles. Given these angles, the circle radii follow as the unique minimizer of a convex energy. The method supports very flexible boundary conditions ranging from free boundaries to control of the boundary shape via prescribed curvatures. Closed meshes of genus zero can be parameterized over the sphere. To parameterize higher genus meshes, we introduce cone singularities at designated vertices. The parameter domain is then a piecewise Euclidean surface. Cone singularities can also help to reduce the often very large area distortion of global conformal maps to moderate levels. Our method involves two optimization problems: a quadratic program and the unconstrained minimization of the circle pattern energy. The latter is a convex function of logarithmic radius variables with simple explicit expressions for gradient and Hessian. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of our algorithm with a variety of examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2483","fieldValue":" We present a streaming algorithm for constructing sparse spanners and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm for this task (due to Feigenbaum et al.). Specifically, the processing time per edge of our algorithm is O(1), and it is drastically smaller than that of the algorithm of Feigenbaum et al., and all other efficiency parameters of our algorithm are no greater (and some of them are strictly smaller) than the respective parameters of the state-of-the-art algorithm. We also devise a fully dynamic centralized algorithm maintaining sparse spanners. This algorithm has incremental update time of O(1), and a nontrivial decremental update time. To our knowledge, this is the first fully dynamic centralized algorithm for maintaining sparse spanners that provides nontrivial bounds on both incremental and decremental update time for a wide range of stretch parameter t."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15648","fieldValue":" We propose an automatic method for finding symmetries of 3D shapes, that is, isometric transforms which leave a shape globally unchanged. These symmetries are deterministically found through the use of an intermediate quantity: the generalized moments. By examining the extrema and spherical harmonic coefficients of these moments, we recover the parameters of the symmetries of the shape. The computation for large composite models is made efficient by using this information in an incremental algorithm capable of recovering the symmetries of a whole shape using the symmetries of its subparts. Applications of this work range from coherent remeshing of geometry with respect to the symmetries of a shape to geometric compression, intelligent mesh editing, and automatic instantiation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15648","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15648","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15649","fieldValue":" We present a new approach to interactive ray tracing of moderate-sized animated scenes based on traversing frustum-bounded packets of coherent rays through uniform grids. By incrementally computing the overlap of the frustum with a slice of grid cells, we accelerate grid traversal by more than a factor of 10, and achieve ray tracing performance competitive with the fastest known packet-based kd-tree ray tracers. The ability to efficiently rebuild the grid on every frame enables this performance even for fully dynamic scenes that typically challenge interactive ray tracing systems."}
