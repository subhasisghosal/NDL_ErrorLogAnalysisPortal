One such service is \"user-provided connectivity\" or UPC. The service offers an alternative to traditional infrastructure-based communication services by allowing users to share their \"home base\" connectivity with other users, thereby increasing their access to connectivity. More users means more connectivity alternatives, i.e., a positive externality, but also greater odds of having to share one's own connectivity, i.e., a negative externality. The tug of war between positive and negative externalities together with the fact that they often depend not just on how many but also which users adopt make it difficult to predict the service's eventual success. Exploring this issue is the focus of this paper, which investigates not only when and why such services may be viable, but also explores how pricing can be used to effectively and practically realize them."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10887","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10887","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10887","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10888","fieldValue":" Hardware-based packet classification has become an essential component in many networking devices. It often relies on ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs), which compare the packet header against a set of rules. TCAMs are not well suited to encode range rules. Range rules are often encoded by multiple TCAM entries, and little is known about the smallest number of entries that one needs for a specific range. In this paper, we introduce the In\/Out TCAM, a new architecture that combines a regular TCAM together with a modified TCAM. This custom architecture enables independent encoding of each rule in a set of rules. We provide the following theoretical results for the new architecture: 1) We give an upper bound on the worst-case expansion of range rules in one and two dimensions. 2) For extremal ranges, which are 89% of the ranges that occur in practice, we provide an efficient algorithm that computes an optimal encoding. 3) We present a closed-form formula for the average expansion of an extremal range."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10888","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10888","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10889","fieldValue":" To provide wide-area network services, resources from different infrastructure providers are needed. Leveraging the consensus-based resource allocation literature, we propose a general distributed auction mechanism for the (NP-hard) virtual network (VNET) embedding problem. Under reasonable assumptions on the bidding scheme, the proposed mechanism is proven to converge, and it is shown that the solutions guarantee a worst-case efficiency of (1 - (1\/e)) relative to the optimal node embedding, or VNET embedding if virtual links are mapped to exactly one physical link. This bound is optimal, that is, no better polynomial-time approximation algorithm exists, unless P = NP. Using extensive simulations, we confirm superior convergence properties and resource utilization when compared to existing distributed VNET embedding solutions, and we show how by appropriate policy design, our mechanism can be instantiated to accommodate the embedding goals of different service and infrastructure providers, resulting in an attractive and flexible resource allocation solution."}
