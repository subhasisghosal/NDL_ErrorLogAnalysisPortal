In these scenarios, artists want explicit control over the edge flows and the singularities of the quad mesh. Despite the significant advances in recent years, existing automatic quad remeshing algorithms are not yet able to achieve the quality of manually created remeshings. We present an interactive system for manual quad remeshing that provides the user with a high degree of control while avoiding the tediousness involved in existing manual tools. With our sketch-based interface the user constructs a quad mesh by defining patches consisting of individual quads. The desired edge flow is intuitively specified by the sketched patch boundaries, and the mesh topology can be adjusted by varying the number of edge subdivisions at patch boundaries. Our system automatically inserts singularities inside patches if necessary, while providing the user with direct control of their topological and geometrical locations. We developed a set of novel user interfaces that assist the user in constructing a curve network representing such patch boundaries. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated through a user evaluation with professional artists. Our system is also useful for editing automatically generated quad meshes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16878","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16878","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16879","fieldValue":"Ebke, Hans-Christian"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16879","fieldValue":" Quadrilateral remeshing approaches based on global parametrization enable many desirable mesh properties. Two of the most important ones are (1) high regularity due to explicit control over irregular vertices and (2) smooth distribution of distortion achieved by convex variational formulations. Apart from these strengths, state-of-the-art techniques suffer from limited reliability on real-world input data, i.e. the determined map might have degeneracies like (local) non-injectivities and consequently often cannot be used directly to generate a quadrilateral mesh. In this paper we propose a novel convex Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) formulation which ensures by construction that the resulting map is within the class of so called Integer-Grid Maps that are guaranteed to imply a quad mesh. In order to overcome the NP-hardness of MIQP and to be able to remesh typical input geometries in acceptable time we propose two additional problem specific optimizations: a complexity reduction algorithm and singularity separating conditions. While the former decouples the dimension of the MIQP search space from the input complexity of the triangle mesh and thus is able to dramatically speed up the computation without inducing inaccuracies, the latter improves the continuous relaxation, which is crucial for the success of modern MIQP optimizers. Our experiments show that the reliability of the resulting algorithm does not only annihilate the main drawback of parametrization based quad-remeshing but moreover enables the global search for high-quality coarse quad layouts - a difficult task solely tackled by greedy methodologies before."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16879","fieldValue":"ACM"}
