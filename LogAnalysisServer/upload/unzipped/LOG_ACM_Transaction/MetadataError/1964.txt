{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16759","fieldValue":" Analyzing and synthesizing point distributions are of central importance for a wide range of problems in computer graphics. Existing synthesis algorithms can only generate white or blue-noise distributions with characteristics dictated by the underlying processes used, and analysis tools have not been focused on exploring relations among distributions. We propose a unified analysis and general synthesis algorithms for point distributions. We employ the pair correlation function as the basis of our methods and design synthesis algorithms that can generate distributions with given target characteristics, possibly extracted from an example point set, and introduce a unified characterization of distributions by mapping them to a space implied by pair correlations. The algorithms accept example and output point sets of different sizes and dimensions, are applicable to multi-class distributions and non-Euclidean domains, simple to implement and run in O(n) time. We illustrate applications of our method to real world distributions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16759","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16759","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16760","fieldValue":"de Goes, Fernando"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16760","fieldValue":" We present a fast, scalable algorithm to generate high-quality blue noise point distributions of arbitrary density functions. At its core is a novel formulation of the recently-introduced concept of capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellation as an optimal transport problem. This insight leads to a continuous formulation able to enforce the capacity constraints exactly, unlike previous work. We exploit the variational nature of this formulation to design an efficient optimization technique of point distributions via constrained minimization in the space of power diagrams. Our mathematical, algorithmic, and practical contributions lead to high-quality blue noise point sets with improved spectral and spatial properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16760","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16760","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16761","fieldValue":" For thirty years, resolution-independent 2D standards (e.g. PostScript, SVG) have depended on CPU-based algorithms for the filling and stroking of paths. Advances in graphics hardware have largely ignored accelerating resolution-independent 2D graphics rendered from paths. We introduce a two-step \"Stencil, then Cover\" (StC) programming interface. Our GPU-based approach builds upon existing techniques for curve rendering using the stencil buffer, but we explicitly decouple in our programming interface the stencil step to determine a path's filled or stroked coverage from the subsequent cover step to rasterize conservative geometry intended to test and reset the coverage determinations of the first step while shading color samples within the path. Our goals are completeness, correctness, quality, and performance---yet we go further to unify path rendering with OpenGL's established 3D and shading pipeline. We have built and productized our approach to accelerate path rendering as an OpenGL extension."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16761","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16761","fieldValue":"ACM"}
