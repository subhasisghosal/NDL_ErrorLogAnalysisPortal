The original paper was written as a primer for research design and statistical evaluation of perceptual responses to auditory displays as well as a catalyst for the formation of interdisciplinary teams for such research. The authors' commentary notes that the ICAD community has shown an increase in cross-disciplinary collaboration but that researchers need to continue to improve their research designs and their statistical techniques to ensure accurate evaluation of auditory displays."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23099","fieldValue":" This research presents a new benchmark dataset for evaluating Short Text Semantic Similarity (STSS) measurement algorithms and the methodology used for its creation. The power of the dataset is evaluated by using it to compare two established algorithms, STASIS and Latent Semantic Analysis. This dataset focuses on measures for use in Conversational Agents; other potential applications include email processing and data mining of social networks. Such applications involve integrating the STSS algorithm in a complex system, but STSS algorithms must be evaluated in their own right and compared with others for their effectiveness before systems integration. Semantic similarity is an artifact of human perception; therefore its evaluation is inherently empirical and requires benchmark datasets derived from human similarity ratings. The new dataset of 64 sentence pairs, STSS-131, has been designed to meet these requirements drawing on a range of resources from traditional grammar to cognitive neuroscience. The human ratings are obtained from a set of trials using new and improved experimental methods, with validated measures and statistics. The results illustrate the increased challenge and the potential longevity of the STSS-131 dataset as the Gold Standard for future STSS algorithm evaluation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23100","fieldValue":" Natural language search relies strongly on perceiving semantics in a query sentence. Semantics is captured by the relationship among the query words, represented as a network (graph). Such a network of words can be fed into larger ontologies, like DBpedia or Google Knowledge Graph, where they appear as subgraphsâ\u20AC\u201D fashioning the name subnetworks (subnets). Thus, subnet is a canonical form for interfacing a natural language query to a graph database and is an integral step for graph-based searching. In this article, we present a novel standalone NLP technique that leverages the cognitive psychology notion of semantic strata for semantic subnetwork extraction from natural language queries. The cognitive model describes some of the fundamental structures employed by the human cognition to construct semantic information in the brain, called semantic strata. We propose a computational model based on conditional random fields to capture the cognitive abstraction provided by semantic strata, facilitating cognitive canonicalization of the query. Our results, conducted on approximately 5000 queries, suggest that the cognitive canonicals based on semantic strata are capable of significantly improving parsing and role labeling performance beyond pure lexical approaches, such as parts-of-speech based techniques. We also find that cognitive canonicalized subnets are more semantically coherent compared to syntax trees when explored in graph ontologies like DBpedia and improve ranking of retrieved documents."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23100","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23100","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.editor","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23101","fieldValue":"Davison, Brian D"}
