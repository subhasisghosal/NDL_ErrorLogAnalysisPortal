Performance of the mechanism is analyzed and evaluated experimentally on a shared memory multiprocessor. A running parallel discrete event simulation is dynamically cloned at decision points to explore different execution paths concurrently. In this way, what-if and alternative scenario analysis can be performed in applications such as gaming or tactical and strategic battle management. A construct called virtual logical processes avoids repeating common computations among clones and improves efficiency. The advantages of cloning are preserved regardless of the number of clones (or execution paths). Our performance results with a commercial air traffic control simulation demonstrate that cloning can significantly reduce the time required to compute multiple alternate futures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24848","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24848","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24849","fieldValue":" This article analyzes the transient buffer content distribution of a queue fed by a large number of Markov fluid sources. We characterize the probability of overflow at time t, given the current buffer level and the number of sources in the on-state. After scaling buffer and bandwidth resources by the number of sources n, we can apply large deviations techniques. The transient overflow probability decays exponentially in n. In case of exponential on\/off sources, we derive an expression for the decay rate of the rare event probability under consideration. For general, Markov fluid sources, we present a plausible conjecture. We also provide the \"most likely path\" from the initial state to overflow (at time t). Knowledge of the decay rate and the most likely path to overflow leads to (i) approximations of the transient overflow probability, and (ii) efficient simulation methods of the rare event of buffer overflow. The simulation methods, based on importance sampling, give a huge speed-up compared to straightforward simulations. The approximations are of low computational complexity, and accurate, as verified by means of simulation experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24849","fieldValue":"A large deviations analysis of the transient of a queue with many Markov fluid inputs: approximations and fast simulation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24849","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24849","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3403","fieldValue":"Holt, Gineke A Ten"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3403","fieldValue":"Doorn, Andrea J Van"}
