Systems and their properties are represented in the same logic, so the assertion that a system meets its specification and the assertion that one system implements another are both expressed by logical implication. TLA is very simple; its syntax and complete formal semantics are summarized in about a page. Yet, TLA is not just a logician's toy; it is extremely powerful, both in principle and in practice. This report introduces TLA and describes how it is used to specify and verify concurrent algorithms. The use of TLA to specify and reason about open systems will be described elsewhere."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20223","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20223","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20224","fieldValue":" The paper studies the incorporation of a fair nondeterministic choice operator into a generalization of Dijkstra's calculus of guarded commands. The generalization drops the law of the excluded miracle to allow commands that correspond to partial relations. Because of fairness, the new operator is not monotonic for the orderings that are generally used for proving the existence of least fixed points for recursive definitions. To prove the existence of fixed points it is necessary to consider several orderings at once, and to restrict the class of recursive definitions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20224","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20224","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20225","fieldValue":" This article presents a solution to the"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20225","fieldValue":" This article presents a solution to the"}
