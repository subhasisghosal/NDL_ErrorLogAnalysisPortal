Given the massive number of user-generated contents shared in online social networks, users are moving to directly access these contents in their preferred social network services. It is intriguing to study the service provision of social contents for global users with satisfactory quality of experience. In this article, we conduct large-scale measurement of a real-world online social network system to study the social content propagation. We have observed important propagation patterns, including social locality, geographical locality, and temporal locality. Motivated by the measurement insights, we propose a propagation-based social-aware delivery framework using a hybrid edge-cloud and peer-assisted architecture. We also design replication strategies for the architecture based on three propagation predictors designed by jointly considering user, content, and context information. In particular, we design a propagation region predictor and a global audience predictor to guide how the edge-cloud servers backup the contents, and a local audience predictor to guide how peers cache the contents for their friends. Our trace-driven experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25535","fieldValue":" Social media is becoming popular these days, where users necessarily interact with each other to form social networks. Influence network, as one special case of social network, has been recognized as significantly impacting social activities and user decisions. We emphasize in this article that the inter-user influence is essentially topic-sensitive, as for different tasks users tend to trust different influencers and be influenced most by them. While existing research focuses on global influence modeling and applies to text-based networks, this work investigates the problem of topic-sensitive influence modeling in the multimedia domain. According to temporal data justification, we propose a multimodal probabilistic model, considering both users' textual annotation and uploaded visual images. This model is capable of simultaneously extracting user topic distributions and topic-sensitive influence strengths. By identifying the topic-sensitive influencer, we are able to conduct applications, like collective search and collaborative recommendation. A risk minimization-based general framework for personalized image search is further presented, where the image search task is transferred to measure the distance of image and personalized query language models. The framework considers the noisy tag issue and enables easy incorporation of social influence. We have conducted experiments on a large-scale Flickr dataset. Qualitative as well as quantitative evaluation results have validated the effectiveness of the topic-sensitive influencer mining model, and demonstrated the advantage of incorporating topic-sensitive influence in personalized image search and topic-based image recommendation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25536","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25536","fieldValue":"ACM"}
