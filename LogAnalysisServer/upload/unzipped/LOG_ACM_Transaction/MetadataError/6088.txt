These problems may be especially difficult for power wheelchair users, as the frame of their wheelchair may obstruct the usersâ\u20AC™ range of motion and reduce their ability to reach objects in the environment. The concept of â\u20ACœchairableâ\u20AC? input devices refers to input devices that are designed to fit with the form of an individual's wheelchair, much like wearable technology fits with an individual's clothing. In this paper, we introduce a new family of chairable input devices: Gest-Rests. A Gest-Rest is a gesture based input device that fits over a standard power wheelchair armrest. A Gest-Rest enables users to perform traditional touch screen gestures, such as press and flick, as well as pressure-based gestures such as squeezing and punching. We have developed the Gest-Rest Family, a suite of armrest-based input devices designed for power wheelchair users. In this paper, we present formative evaluations of these prototypes with wheelchair users and therapists and present their opinions of this new integrated input technology. Our results show the benefits of armrest-based input devices as well as a comparison of physical switches, force sensing, and capacitive input for individuals with limited dexterity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6248","fieldValue":"Talpin, Jean-Pierre"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6248","fieldValue":" This special issue is based on innovative ideas presented and discussed during the first ACM\/IEEE Conference on Formal Methods and Models for Co-Design (MEMOCODE) held at Mont Saint Michel in France during the summer of 2003. Selected papers from the conference were invited for this special issue together with an open call for papers soliciting novel contributions on the topics of this conference. Rigorous reviews of 12 submissions led to the selection of four papers for this special issue. In this editorial statement, we outline the premise and the context of this special issue, and give a short introduction to the theme under consideration and briefly introduce the papers selected. We also thank the authors who submitted their contributions to this special issue, and all the reviewers without whose dedication and hard work toward ensuring the quality of the selections, editing this special issue would have been impossible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6248","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6248","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6249","fieldValue":"Morin-Allory, Katell"}
