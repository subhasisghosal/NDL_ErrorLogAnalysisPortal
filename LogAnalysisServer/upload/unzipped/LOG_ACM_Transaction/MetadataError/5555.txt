PAAs provide a unifying framework to approach many problems arising in computational biology and elsewhere. We present five different applications, namely 1) pattern matching statistics on random texts, including the computation of the distribution of occurrence counts, waiting times, and clump sizes under hidden Markov background models; 2) exact analysis of window-based pattern matching algorithms; 3) sensitivity of filtration seeds used to detect candidate sequence alignments; 4) length and mass statistics of peptide fragments resulting from enzymatic cleavage reactions; and 5) read length statistics of 454 and IonTorrent sequencing reads. The diversity of these applications indicates the flexibility and unifying character of the presented framework. While the construction of a PAA depends on the particular application, we single out a frequently applicable construction method: We introduce deterministic arithmetic automata (DAAs) to model deterministic calculations on sequences, and demonstrate how to construct a PAA from a given DAA and a finite-memory random text model. This procedure is used for all five discussed applications and greatly simplifies the construction of PAAs. Implementations are available as part of the MoSDi package. Its application programming interface facilitates the rapid development of new applications based on the PAA framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4854","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4854","fieldValue":"Hidden Markov models,Automata,Computational modeling,Markov processes,Probabilistic logic,Context,Bioinformatics,dynamic programming.,Probabilistic automaton,text model,hidden Markov model,pattern matching,statistics,clump,string algorithm,analysis of algorithms,alignment seed,peptide mass fingerprinting,DNA sequencing"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4854","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4854","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4855","fieldValue":"Wong, Hau-San"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4855","fieldValue":" In order to perform successful diagnosis and treatment of cancer, discovering, and classifying cancer types correctly is essential. One of the challenging properties of class discovery from cancer data sets is that cancer gene expression profiles not only include a large number of genes, but also contains a lot of noisy genes. In order to reduce the effect of noisy genes in cancer gene expression profiles, we propose two new consensus clustering frameworks, named as triple spectral clustering-based consensus clustering (SC^{3}) and double spectral clustering-based consensus clustering (SC^{2}Ncut) in this paper, for cancer discovery from gene expression profiles. SC^{3} integrates the spectral clustering (SC) algorithm multiple times into the ensemble framework to process gene expression profiles. Specifically, spectral clustering is applied to perform clustering on the gene dimension and the cancer sample dimension, and also used as the consensus function to partition the consensus matrix constructed from multiple clustering solutions. Compared with SC^{3}, SC^{2}Ncut adopts the normalized cut algorithm, instead of spectral clustering, as the consensus function. Experiments on both synthetic data sets and real cancer gene expression profiles illustrate that the proposed approaches not only achieve good performance on gene expression profiles, but also outperforms most of the existing approaches in the process of class discovery from these profiles."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4855","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
