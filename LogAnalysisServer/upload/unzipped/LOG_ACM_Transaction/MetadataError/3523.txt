Multicamera video summarization seeks to make this task more tractable by generating a reduced set of output summary videos that concisely capture important portions of the input set. We present a system that approaches summarization at the level of detected activity motifs and shortens the input videos by compacting the representation of individual activities. Additionally, redundancy is removed across camera views by omitting from the summary activity occurrences that can be predicted by other occurrences. The system also detects anomalous events within a unified framework and can highlight them in the summary. Our contributions are a method for selecting useful parts of an activity to present to a viewer using activity motifs and a novel framework to score the importance of activity occurrences and allow transfer of importance between temporally related activities without solving the correspondence problem. We provide summarization results for a two camera network, an eleven camera network, and data from PETS 2001. We also include results from Amazon Mechanical Turk human experiments to evaluate how our visualization decisions affect task performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21478","fieldValue":" Interference model is the basis of MAC protocol design in wireless networked sensing and control, and it directly affects the efficiency and predictability of wireless messaging. To exploit the strengths of both the physical and the protocol interference models, we analyze how network traffic, link length, and wireless signal attenuation affect the optimal instantiation of the protocol model. We also identify the inherent trade-off between reliability and throughput in the model instantiation. Our analysis sheds light on the open problem of efficiently optimizing the protocol model instantiation. Based on the analytical results, we propose the physical-ratio-K (PRK) interference model as a reliability-oriented instantiation of the protocol model. Via analysis, simulation, and testbed-based measurement, we show that PRK-based scheduling achieves a network throughput very close to (e.g., 95&percnt;) what is enabled by physical-model-based scheduling while ensuring the required packet delivery reliability. The PRK model inherits both the high fidelity of the physical model and the locality of the protocol model, thus it is expected to be suitable for distributed protocol design. These findings shed new light on wireless interference models; they also suggest new approaches to MAC protocol design in the presence of uncertainties in network and environmental conditions as well as application QoS requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21479","fieldValue":"Coyle, Edward J"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21479","fieldValue":" We determine the optimal nonuniform spatial density of nodes in a single-hop Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) whose task is the distributed detection of a target within its sensing field. The optimization approach accounts for such factors as the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol being used, the wireless channel's propagation characteristics, a randomized sleep\/wake-up scheduling protocol, network coverage constraints, the energy consumed, the time to reach a decision, and the number of nodes in the network. The node density that minimizes the average Decision Error Probability (DEP) when a node at the center of the network serves as the Cluster Head (CH) is shown to be a function of the distance from this CH. The solution of this optimization problem and simulations demonstrate both the significant performance improvement provided by nonuniform spatial densities and the trade-offs that are possible amongst energy, network lifetime, detection performance, and time to reach a decision."}
