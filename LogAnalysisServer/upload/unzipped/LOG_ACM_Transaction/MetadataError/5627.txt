It may reach from one steady state to other within a finite time span. In this paper, a closed-loop control scheme is proposed to steer states of the glycolysis and glycogenolysis (GG) pathway from one of its steady states to other. The GG pathway is modeled in the synergism and saturation system formalism, known as S-system. This S-system model is linearized into the controllable Brunovsky canonical form using a feedback linearization technique. For closed-loop control, the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and the linear-quadratic gaussian (LQG) regulator are invoked to design a controller for tracking prespecified steady states. In the feedback linearization technique, a global diffeomorphism function is proposed that facilitates in achieving the regulation requirement. The robustness of the regulated GG pathway is studied considering input perturbation and with measurement noise."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4977","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4977","fieldValue":"Controllability, feedback linearization, linear quadratic gaussian regulator, S-system, glycolysis, glycogenolysis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4978","fieldValue":"Eren Ozsoy, Oyku"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4978","fieldValue":" Inference of topology of signaling networks from perturbation experiments is a challenging problem. Recently, the inference problem has been formulated as a reference network editing problem and it has been shown that finding the minimum number of edit operations on a reference network to comply with perturbation experiments is an NP-complete problem. In this paper, we propose an integer linear optimization (ILP) model for reconstruction of signaling networks from RNAi data and a reference network. The ILP model guarantees the optimal solution; however, is practical only for small signaling networks of size 10-15 genes due to computational complexity. To scale for large signaling networks, we propose a divide and conquer-based heuristic, in which a given reference network is divided into smaller subnetworks that are solved separately and the solutions are merged together to form the solution for the large network. We validate our proposed approach on real and synthetic data sets, and comparison with the state of the art shows that our proposed approach is able to scale better for large networks while attaining similar or better biological accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4978","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4978","fieldValue":"A Divide and Conquer Approach for Construction of Large-Scale Signaling Networks from PPI and RNAi Data Using Linear Programming"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4978","fieldValue":"ACM"}
