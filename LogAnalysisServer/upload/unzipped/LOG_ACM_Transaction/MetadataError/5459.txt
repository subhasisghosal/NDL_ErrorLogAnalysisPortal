For high-dimensional data, a normal prognostic method undergoes two steps: feature selection and prognosis analysis. Recently, the L_1\\hbox{-}L_2-norm Support Vector Machine (L_1\\hbox{-}L_2 SVM) has been developed as an effective classification technique and shown good classification performance with automatic feature selection. In this paper, we extend L_1\\hbox{-}L_2 SVM for regression analysis with automatic feature selection. We further improve the L_1\\hbox{-}L_2 SVM for prognostic prediction by utilizing the information of censored data as constraints. We design an efficient solution to the new optimization problem. The proposed method is compared with other seven prognostic prediction methods on three real-world data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs consistently better than the medium performance. It is more efficient than other algorithms with the similar performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4683","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4683","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4683","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4684","fieldValue":"Muller-Wittig, Wolfgang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4684","fieldValue":" Scanning protein sequence database is an often repeated task in computational biology and bioinformatics. However, scanning large protein databases, such as GenBank, with popular tools such as BLASTP requires long runtimes on sequential architectures. Due to the continuing rapid growth of sequence databases, there is a high demand to accelerate this task. In this paper, we demonstrate how GPUs, powered by the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), can be used as an efficient computational platform to accelerate the BLASTP algorithm. In order to exploit the GPU's capabilities for accelerating BLASTP, we have used a compressed deterministic finite state automaton for hit detection as well as a hybrid parallelization scheme. Our implementation achieves speedups up to 10.0 on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295 GPU compared to the sequential NCBI BLASTP 2.2.22.
