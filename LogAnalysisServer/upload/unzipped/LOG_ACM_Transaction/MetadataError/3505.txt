{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21437","fieldValue":" High-frequency sampling is not only a prerogative of high-energy physics or machinery diagnostic monitoring: critical environmental and structural health monitoring applications also have such a challenging constraint. Moreover, such unique design constraints are often coupled with the requirement of high synchronism among the distributed acquisition units, minimal energy consumption, and large communication bandwidth. Such severe constraints have led scholars to suggest wired centralized monitoring solutions, which have only recently been complemented with wireless technologies. This article suggests a hybrid wireless-wired monitoring system combining the advantages of wireless and wired technologies within a distributed high-frequency-sampling framework. The suggested architecture satisfies the mentioned constraints, thanks to an ad-hoc design of the hardware, the availability of efficient energy management policies, and up-to-date harvesting mechanisms. At the same time, the architecture supports adaptation capabilities by relying on the remote reprogrammability of key application parameters. The proposed architecture has been successfully deployed in the Swiss-Italian Alps to monitor the collapse of rock faces in three geographical areas."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21438","fieldValue":" It is well known that periodically putting nodes into sleep can effectively save energy in wireless sensor networks at the cost of increased communication delays. However, most existing work mainly focuses on the static sleep scheduling, which cannot guarantee the desired delay when the network conditions change dynamically. In many applications with user-specified end-to-end delay requirements, the duty cycle of every node should be tuned individually at runtime based on the network conditions to achieve the desired end-to-end delay guarantees and energy efficiency. In this article, we propose DutyCon, a control theory-based dynamic duty-cycle control approach. DutyCon decomposes the end-to-end delay guarantee problem into a set of single-hop delay guarantee problems along each data flow in the network. We then formulate the single-hop delay guarantee problem as a dynamic feedback control problem and design the controller rigorously, based on feedback control theory, for analytic assurance of control accuracy and system stability. DutyCon also features a queuing delay adaptation scheme that adapts the duty cycle of each node to unpredictable incoming packet rates, as well as a novel energy-balancing approach that extends the network lifetime by dynamically adjusting the delay requirement allocated to each hop. Our empirical results on a hardware testbed demonstrate that DutyCon can effectively achieve the desired trade-off between end-to-end delay and energy conservation. Extensive simulation results also show that DutyCon outperforms two baseline sleep scheduling protocols by having more energy savings while meeting the end-to-end delay requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21438","fieldValue":"DutyCon: A dynamic duty-cycle control approach to end-to-end delay guarantees in wireless sensor networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21438","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21438","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21439","fieldValue":" A coalitional game theoretic scheme is proposed that aims at maximizing wireless sensor network lifetime under specified QoS. Employing a small number of nodes of increased computing power and lifetime called representatives, an adaptive clustering scheme is proposed where neighboring nodes form coalitions in order to increase energy efficiency at the cost of controllable data-accuracy reduction. The coalition formation is globally optimized by the representatives. The spatial correlation of the sensed phenomenon measurements is exploited to formulate a cooperation scheme that reduces drastically the number of node transmissions. The specifications regarding the accuracy of the collected data determine the extent of coalition formation. The efficiency and stability of the proposed coalitional scheme are studied through simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21439","fieldValue":"Energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks: A game-theoretic approach based on coalition formation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21439","fieldValue":"ACM"}
