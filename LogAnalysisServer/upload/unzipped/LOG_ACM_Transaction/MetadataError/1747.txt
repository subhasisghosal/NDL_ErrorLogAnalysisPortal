In this work, we draw from the literature on design and human cognition to better understand the design processes of novice and casual modelers, whose goals and motivations are often distinct from those of professional artists. The result is a method for creating exploratory modeling tools, which are appropriate for casual users who may lack rigidly-specified goals or operational knowledge of modeling techniques. Our method is based on parametric design spaces, which are often high dimensional and contain wide quality variations. Our system estimates the distribution of good models in a space by tracking the modeling activity of a distributed community of users. These estimates drive intuitive modeling tools, creating a self-reinforcing system that becomes easier to use as more people participate. We present empirical evidence that the tools developed with our method allow rapid creation of complex, high-quality 3D models by users with no specialized modeling skills or experience. We report analyses of usage patterns garnered throughout the year-long deployment of one such tool, and demonstrate the generality of the method by applying it to several design spaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16206","fieldValue":" This paper describes a method for optimizing the parameters of a physics-based controller for full-body, 3D walking. A modified version of the SIMBICON controller [Yin et al. 2007] is optimized for characters of varying body shape, walking speed and step length. The objective function includes terms for power minimization, angular momentum minimization, and minimal head motion, among others. Together these terms produce a number of important features of natural walking, including active toe-off, near-passive knee swing, and leg extension during swing. We explain the specific form of our objective criteria, and show the importance of each term to walking style. We demonstrate optimized controllers for walking with different speeds, variation in body shape, and in ground slope."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16207","fieldValue":" We present methods for creating compact and efficient data-driven character controllers. Our first method identifies the essential motion data examples tailored for a given task. It enables complex yet efficient high-dimensional controllers, as well as automatically generated connecting controllers that merge a set of independent controllers into a much larger aggregate one without modifying existing ones. Our second method iteratively refines basis functions to enable highly complex value functions. We show that our methods dramatically reduce the computation and storage requirement of controllers and enable very complex behaviors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16207","fieldValue":"ACM"}
