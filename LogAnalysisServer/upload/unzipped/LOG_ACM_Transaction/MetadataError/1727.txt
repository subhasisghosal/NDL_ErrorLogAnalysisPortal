{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16154","fieldValue":" We present a new Laplacian solver for minimal surfaces---surfaces having a mean curvature of zero everywhere except at some fixed (Dirichlet) boundary conditions. Our solution has two main contributions: First, we provide a robust rasterization technique to transform continuous boundary values (diffusion curves) to a discrete domain. Second, we define a variable stencil size diffusion solver that solves the minimal surface problem. We prove that the solver converges to the right solution, and demonstrate that it is at least as fast as commonly proposed multigrid solvers, but much simpler to implement. It also works for arbitrary image resolutions, as well as 8 bit data. We show examples of robust diffusion curve rendering where our curve rasterization and diffusion solver eliminate the strobing artifacts present in previous methods. We also show results for real-time seamless cloning and stitching of large image panoramas."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16154","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16154","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16155","fieldValue":" Diffusion curve images (DCI) provide a powerful tool for efficient 2D image generation, storage and manipulation. A DCI consist of curves with colors defined on either side. By diffusing these colors over the image, the final result includes sharp boundaries along the curves with smoothly shaded regions between them. This paper extends the application of diffusion curves to render high quality surface details on 3D objects. The first extension is a view dependent warping technique that dynamically reallocates texture space so that object parts that appear large on screen get more texture for increased detail. The second extension is a dynamic feature embedding technique that retains crisp, anti-aliased curve details even in extreme closeups. The third extension is the application of dynamic feature embedding to displacement mapping and geometry images. Our results show high quality renderings of diffusion curve textures, displacements, and geometry images, all rendered interactively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16155","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16155","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16156","fieldValue":"Hu, Shi-Min"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16156","fieldValue":"Liu, Tian-Qiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16156","fieldValue":" Image\/video editing by strokes has become increasingly popular due to the ease of interaction. Propagating the user inputs to the rest of the image\/video, however, is often time and memory consuming especially for large data. We propose here an efficient scheme that allows affinity-based edit propagation to be computed on data containing tens of millions of pixels at interactive rate (in matter of seconds). The key in our scheme is a novel means for approximately solving the optimization problem involved in edit propagation, using adaptive clustering in a high-dimensional, affinity space. Our approximation significantly reduces the cost of existing affinity-based propagation methods while maintaining visual fidelity, and enables interactive stroke-based editing even on high resolution images and long video sequences using commodity computers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16156","fieldValue":"ACM"}
