This allows features of a connected drawing to merge, split, appear, or disappear at desired times via keyframes that introduce the desired topological change. Because the resulting space-time complex directly captures the time-varying topological structure, features are readily edited in both space and time in a way that reflects the intent of the drawing. A formal description of the data structure is provided, along with topological and geometric invariants. We illustrate our modeling paradigm with experimental results on various examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17393","fieldValue":"2D"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17393","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17393","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17394","fieldValue":" We describe our successful initiative to accelerate Adobe Illustrator with the graphics hardware pipeline of modern GPUs. Relying on OpenGL 4.4 plus recent OpenGL extensions for advanced blend modes and first-class GPU-accelerated path rendering, we accelerate the Adobe Graphics Model (AGM) layer responsible for rendering sophisticated Illustrator scenes. Illustrator documents render in either an RGB or CMYK color mode. While GPUs are designed and optimized for RGB rendering, we orchestrate OpenGL rendering of vector content in the proper CMYK color space and accommodate the 5+ color components required. We support both non-isolated and isolated transparency groups, knockout, patterns, and arbitrary path clipping. We harness GPU tessellation to shade paths smoothly with gradient meshes. We do all this and render complex Illustrator scenes 2 to 6x faster than CPU rendering at Full HD resolutions; and 5 to 16x faster at Ultra HD resolutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17394","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17394","fieldValue":"ACM"}
