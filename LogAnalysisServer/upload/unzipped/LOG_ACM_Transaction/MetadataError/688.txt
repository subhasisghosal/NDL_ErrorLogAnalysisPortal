This article presents an improved MCF model based CAD flow that performs aggressive optimizations, such as topology and wire style optimization, to reduce the energy and switch area of FPGA global routing architectures. The experiments show that when compared to traditional mesh architecture, the optimized FPGA routing architectures achieve up to 10&percnt; to 15&percnt; energy savings and up to 20&percnt; switch area savings in average for a set of seven benchmark circuits."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13116","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13116","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13116","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13117","fieldValue":"Huang, Shih-Hsu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13117","fieldValue":"Chang, Chia-Ming"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13117","fieldValue":"Nieh, Yow-Tyng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13117","fieldValue":" In a synchronous sequential circuit, huge current peaks are often observed at the moment of clock transition (since all registers are clocked). Previous works focus on reducing the number of switching registers. However, even though the switching registers are the same, different combinations of switching directions still result in different peak currents. Based on that observation, in this article, we propose an ECO (engineering change order) approach to minimize the peak current by considering the switching directions of registers. Our approach is well suitable for reducing the peak current in IC testing. Experimental data consistently show that our approach works well in practice."}
