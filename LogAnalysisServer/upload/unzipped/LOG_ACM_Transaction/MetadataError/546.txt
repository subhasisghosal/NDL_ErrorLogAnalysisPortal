We analyze the control flow of the specification model to detect mutually exclusive sections of the computation. A selectively-clocked interconnection of interacting FSMs is automatically generated and optimized, where each FSM controls the execution of one section of computation. Only one of the interacting FSMs is active for a high fraction of the operation time, while the others are idle and their clocks are stopped. Periodically, the active machine releases the control of the system to another FSM and stops. Our interacting FSM implementation achieves consistently lower power dissipation than the functionally equivalent monolithic implementation. On average, 37% power savings and 12% speedup are obtained, despite a 30% area overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12773","fieldValue":" One of the primary advantages of a high-level synthesis system is its ability to explore the design space. This paper presents several methodologies for design space exploration that compute all optimal tradeoff points for the combined problem of scheduling, clock-length determination, and module selection. We discuss how each methodology takes advantage of the structure within the design space itself as well as the structure of, and interactions among, each of the three subproblems.
