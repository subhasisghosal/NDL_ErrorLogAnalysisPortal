We show that the worst-case delay problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, whose size grows exponentially with the number of nodes involved. Furthermore, we present approximate solution schemes to find upper and lower delay bounds on the worst-case delay. Both only require to solve just one linear programming problem and yield bounds that are generally more accurate than those found in the previous work, which are computed under more restrictive assumptions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10800","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10800","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10800","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10801","fieldValue":"Di Francesco, Mario"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10801","fieldValue":" In most wireless sensor network (WSN) applications, data are typically gathered by sensor nodes and reported to a data collection point called sink. To support such a data collection pattern, a tree structure rooted at the sink is defined. Depending on various factors, including the WSN topology and the availability of resources, the energy consumption of nodes in different paths of the data collection tree may vary largely, thus affecting the overall network lifetime. This paper addresses the problem of lifetime maximization of WSNs based on data collection trees. Specifically, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm, called Randomized Switching for Maximizing Lifetime (RaSMaLai), that aims at extending the lifetime of WSNs through load balancing. Given an initial data collection tree, RaSMaLai randomly switches some sensor nodes from their original paths to other paths with lower load. We prove that, under appropriate settings of the operating parameters, RaSMaLai converges with a low time complexity. We further design a distributed version of our algorithm. Through an extensive performance evaluation study that includes simulation of large-scale scenarios and real experiments on a WSN testbed, we show that the proposed RaSMaLai algorithm and its distributed version achieve a longer network lifetime than the state-of-the-art solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10801","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10801","fieldValue":"ACM"}
