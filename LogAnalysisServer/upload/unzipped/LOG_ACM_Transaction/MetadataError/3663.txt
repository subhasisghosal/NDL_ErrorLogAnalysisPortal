{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3088","fieldValue":" High-quality bilingual dictionaries are very useful, but such resources are rarely available for lower-density language pairs, especially for those that are closely related. Using a third language to link two other languages is a well-known solution and usually requires only two input bilingual dictionaries A-B and B-C to automatically induce the new one, A-C. This approach, however, has never been demonstrated to utilize the complete structures of the input bilingual dictionaries, and this is a key failing because the dropped meanings negatively influence the result. This article proposes a constraint approach to pivot-based dictionary induction where language A and C are closely related. We create constraints from language similarity and model the structures of the input dictionaries as a Boolean optimization problem, which is then formulated within the Weighted Partial Max-SAT framework, an extension of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). All of the encoded CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form), the predominant input language of modern SAT\/MAX-SAT solvers, formulas are evaluated by a solver to produce the target (output) bilingual dictionary. Moreover, we discuss alternative formalizations as a comparison study. We designed a tool that uses the Sat4j library as the default solver to implement our method and conducted an experiment in which the output bilingual dictionary achieved better quality than the baseline method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3088","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3088","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21836","fieldValue":"Rajavel, Senthilkumar T"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21836","fieldValue":" In FPGA CAD flow, the clustering stage builds the foundation for placement and routing stages and affects performance parameters, such as routability, delay, and channel width significantly. Net sharing and criticality are the two most commonly used factors in clustering cost functions. With this study, we first derive a third term, net-length factor, and then design a generic method for integrating net length into the clustering algorithms. Net-length factor enables characterizing the nets based on the routing stress they might cause during later stages of the CAD flow and is essential for enhancing the routability of the design. We evaluate the effectiveness of integrating net length as a factor into the well-known timing (T-VPack)-, depopulation (T-NDPack)-, and routability (iRAC and T-RPack)-driven clustering algorithms. Through exhaustive experimental studies, we show that net-length factor consistently helps improve the channel-width performance of routability-, depopulation-, and timing-driven clustering algorithms that do not explicitly target low fan-out nets in their cost functions. Particularly, net-length factor leads to average reduction in channel width for T-VPack, T-RPack, and T-NDPack by 11.6&percnt;, 10.8&percnt;, and 14.2&percnt;, respectively, and in a majority of the cases, improves the critical-path delay without increasing the array size."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21836","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21837","fieldValue":" The problem of creating efficient mappings of dataflow graphs onto specific architectures (i.e., solving the place and route problem) is incredibly challenging. The difficulty is especially acute in the area of Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs) to the extent that solving the mapping problem may remove a significant bottleneck to adoption. We believe that the next generation of mapping algorithms will exhibit pattern recognition, the ability to learn from experience, and identification of creative solutions, all of which are human characteristics. This manuscript describes our game UNTANGLED, developed and fine-tuned over the course of a year to allow us to capture and analyze human mapping strategies. It also describes our results to date. We find that the mapping problem can be crowdsourced very effectively, that players can outperform existing algorithms, and that successful player strategies share many elements in common. Based on our observations and analysis, we make concrete recommendations for future research directions for mapping onto CGRAs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21837","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21837","fieldValue":"ACM"}
