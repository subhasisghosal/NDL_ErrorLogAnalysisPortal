The functional correctness and design robustness of the embedded systems involved in such domains are crucial for the safety of personal\/enterprise property or even human lives. Thereby, a holistic design procedure that considers all the important design concerns is essential. In this article, we approach embedded systems design from an integral perspective. We consider not only the classic real-time and quality of service requirements, but also the emerging security and power efficiency demands. Modern embedded systems are not any more developed for a fixed purpose, but instead designed for undertaking various processing requests. This leads to the concept of multimode embedded systems, in which the number and nature of active tasks change during runtime. Under dynamic situations, providing high performance along with various design concerns becomes a really difficult problem. Therefore, we propose a novel power-aware secure embedded systems design framework that efficiently solves the problem of runtime quality optimization with security and power constraints. The efficiency of our proposed techniques are evaluated in extensive experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6973","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6973","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1638","fieldValue":" Instruction delivery is a critical component for wide-issue, high-frequency processors since its bandwidth and accuracy place an upper limit on performance. The processor front-end accuracy and bandwidth are limited by instruction-cache misses, multicycle instruction-cache accesses, and target or direction mispredictions for control-flow operations. This paper presents a block-aware instruction set (BLISS) that allows software to assist with front-end challenges. BLISS defines basic block descriptors that are stored separately from the actual instructions in a program. We show that BLISS allows for a decoupled front-end that tolerates instruction-cache latency, facilitates instruction prefetching, and leads to higher prediction accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1638","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1638","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6974","fieldValue":" This article presents a survey of energy-aware scheduling algorithms proposed for real-time systems. The analysis presents the main results starting from the middle 1990s until today, showing how the proposed solutions evolved to address the evolution of the platform's features and needs. The survey first presents a taxonomy to classify the existing approaches for uniprocessor systems, distinguishing them according to the technology exploited for reducing energy consumption, that is, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), Dynamic Power Management (DPM), or both. Then, the survey discusses the approaches proposed in the literature to deal with the additional problems related to the evolution of computing platforms toward multicore architectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6974","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6974","fieldValue":"ACM"}
