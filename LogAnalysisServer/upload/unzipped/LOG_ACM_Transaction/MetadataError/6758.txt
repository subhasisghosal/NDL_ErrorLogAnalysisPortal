{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8026","fieldValue":" Traditional clustering algorithms deal with a single clustering task on a single dataset. However, there are many related tasks in the real world, which motivates multitask clustering. Recently some multitask clustering algorithms have been proposed, and among them multitask Bregman clustering (MBC) is a very applicable method. MBC alternatively updates clusters and learns relationships between clusters of different tasks, and the two phases boost each other. However, the boosting does not always have positive effects on improving the clustering performance, it may also cause negative effects. Another issue of MBC is that it cannot deal with nonlinear separable data. In this article, we show that in MBC, the process of using cluster relationship to boost the cluster updating phase may cause negative effects, that is, cluster centroids may be skewed under some conditions. We propose a smart multitask Bregman clustering (S-MBC) algorithm which can identify the negative effects of the boosting and avoid the negative effects if they occur. We then propose a multitask kernel clustering (MKC) framework for nonlinear separable data by using a similar framework like MBC in the kernel space. We also propose a specific optimization method, which is quite different from that of MBC, to implement the MKC framework. Since MKC can also cause negative effects like MBC, we further extend the framework of MKC to a smart multitask kernel clustering (S-MKC) framework in a similar way that S-MBC is extended from MBC. We conduct experiments on 10 real world multitask clustering datasets to evaluate the performance of S-MBC and S-MKC. The results on clustering accuracy show that: (1) compared with the original MBC algorithm MBC, S-MBC and S-MKC perform much better; (2) compared with the convex discriminative multitask relationship clustering (DMTRC) algorithms DMTRC-L and DMTRC-R which also avoid negative transfer, S-MBC and S-MKC perform worse in the (ideal) case in which different tasks have the same cluster number and the empirical label marginal distribution in each task distributes evenly, but better or comparable in other (more general) cases. Moreover, S-MBC and S-MKC can work on the datasets in which different tasks have different number of clusters, violating the assumptions of DMTRC-L and DMTRC-R. The results on efficiency show that S-MBC and S-MKC consume more computational time than MBC and less computational time than DMTRC-L and DMTRC-R. Overall S-MBC and S-MKC are competitive compared with the state-of-the-art multitask clustering algorithms in synthetical terms of accuracy, efficiency and applicability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8027","fieldValue":"Carley, Kathleen M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8027","fieldValue":" Given social networks over time, how can we measure network activities across different timesteps with a limited number of metrics? We propose two classes of dynamic metrics for assessing temporal evolution patterns of agents in terms of persistency and emergence. For each class of dynamic metrics, we implement it using three different temporal aggregation models ranging from the most commonly used Average Aggregation Model to more the complex models such as the Exponential Aggregation Model. We argue that the problem of measuring temporal patterns can be formulated using Recency and Primacy effect, which is a concept used to characterize human cognitive processes. Experimental results show that the way metrics model Recency--Primacy effect is closely related to their abilities to measure temporal patterns. Furthermore, our results indicate that future network agent activities can be predicted based on history information using dynamic metrics. By conducting multiple experiments, we are also able to find an optimal length of history information that is most relevant to future activities. This optimal length is highly consistent within a dataset and can be used as an intrinsic metric to evaluate a dynamic social network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8028","fieldValue":" The availability of trajectories tracking the geographical locations of people as a function of time offers an opportunity to study human behaviors. In this article, we study rationality from the perspective of user decision on visiting a point of interest (POI) which is represented as a trajectory. However, the analysis of rationality is challenged by a number of issues, for example, how to model a trajectory in terms of complex user decision processes? and how to detect hidden factors that have significant impact on the rational decision making? In this study, we propose Rationality Analysis Model (RAM) to analyze rationality from trajectories in terms of a set of impact factors. In order to automatically identify hidden factors, we propose a method, Collective Hidden Factor Retrieval (CHFR), which can also be generalized to parse multiple trajectories at the same time or parse individual trajectories of different time periods. Extensive experimental study is conducted on three large-scale real-life datasets (i.e., taxi trajectories, user shopping trajectories, and visiting trajectories in a theme park). The results show that the proposed methods are efficient, effective, and scalable. We also deploy a system in a large theme park to conduct a field study. Interesting findings and user feedback of the field study are provided to support other applications in user behavior mining and analysis, such as business intelligence and user management for marketing purposes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8028","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8028","fieldValue":"ACM"}
