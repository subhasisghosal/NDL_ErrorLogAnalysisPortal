In this article we present a measurement-based admission control algorithm that helps control traffic congestion and guarantee QoS throughout the lifetime of a connection. When a new user requests to enter the network, probe packets are sent from the source to the destination to estimate the impact that the new connection will have on the QoS of both the new and the existing users. The algorithm uses a novel algebra of QoS metrics, inspired by Warshall's algorithm, to look for a path with acceptable QoS values to accommodate the new flow. We describe the underlying mathematical principles and present experimental results obtained by evaluating the method in a large laboratory test-bed operating the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) protocol."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1136","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1136","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2014","fieldValue":"J, Soumya"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2014","fieldValue":" The addition of express channels to a traditional mesh network-on-chip (NoC) has emerged as a viable solution to solve the problem of high latency. In this article, we address the problem of integrated mapping and synthesis for express channel--based mesh NoC topologies. An integer linear programming--based formulation has been presented for the mapping problem followed by a constructive heuristic for simultaneous application mapping and synthesis for an express channel--based NoC. The static and dynamic simulation results indicate that the obtained mappings lead to significant reduction in both average packet delay and network energy consumption. The obtained synthesized topologies were also found to be much more power efficient compared to conventional express channel topologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2014","fieldValue":"ACM"}
