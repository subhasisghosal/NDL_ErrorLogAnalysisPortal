Unlike previous shading reuse methods that require an explicit object-to-image space mapping for shading density estimation or shading accuracy, our method performs shading density control and actual shading reuse in different spaces with uncorrelated criterions. Specifically, we generate the shading points by shooting a user-controlled number of shading rays from the image space, while the evaluated shading values are assigned to antialiasing samples through object-space nearest neighbor searches. Shading samples are generated in separate layers corresponding to first bounce ray paths to reduce spurious reuse from very different ray paths. This method eliminates the necessity of an explicit object-to-image space mapping, enabling the elegant handling of ray tracing effects such as reflection and refraction. The overhead of our shading reuse operations is minimized by a highly parallel implementation on the GPU. Compared to the state-of-the-art micropolygon ray tracing algorithm, our method is able to reduce the required shading evaluations by an order of magnitude and achieve significant performance gains."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16549","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16549","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16549","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2569","fieldValue":" A long-standing open question in information theory is to characterize the unicast capacity of a wireless relay network. The difficulty arises due to the complex signal interactions induced in the network, since the wireless channel inherently broadcasts the signals and there is interference among transmissions. Recently, Avestimehr et al. [2007b] proposed a linear deterministic model that takes into account the shared nature of wireless channels, focusing on the signal interactions rather than the background noise. They generalized the min-cut max-flow theorem for graphs to networks of deterministic channels and proved that the capacity can be achieved using information theoretical tools. They showed that the value of the minimum cut is in this case the minimum rank of all the adjacency matrices describing source-destination cuts. In this article, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that discovers the relay encoding strategy to achieve the min-cut value in linear deterministic (wireless) networks, for the case of a unicast connection. Our algorithm crucially uses a notion of linear independence between channels to calculate the capacity in polynomial time. Moreover, we can achieve the capacity by using very simple one-symbol processing at the intermediate nodes, thereby constructively yielding finite-length strategies that achieve the unicast capacity of the linear deterministic (wireless) relay network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2569","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2569","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16550","fieldValue":"Sitthi-Amorn, Pitchaya"}
