For the consideration of costs, low-cost embedded flash storages such as flash memory cards are often employed on such devices. Different from solid-state disks, the RAM buffer equipped on low-cost embedded flash storages are very small, for example, limited under several dozens of kilobytes, despite of the rapidly growing capacity of the storages. The significance of effectively utilizing the very limited on-device RAM buffers of embedded flash storages is therefore highlighted, and a novel design of scalable flash management schemes is needed to tackle the new access constraints of MLC NAND flash memory. In this work, a highly scalable design of the flash translation layer is presented with the considerations of the on-device RAM size, user access patterns, address-mapping-information caching and MLC access constraints. Through a series of experiments, it is verified that, with appropriate settings of cache sizes, the proposed management scheme provides comparable performance results to prior arts with much lower requirements on the on-device RAM. In other words, the proposed scheme suggests a strategy to make better use of the on-device RAM, and is suitable for embedded flash storages."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13350","fieldValue":"An index-based management scheme with adaptive caching for huge-scale low-cost embedded flash storages"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13351","fieldValue":" Traditional array organization of bipolar nonvolatile memories such as STT-MRAM and memristor utilizes two bitlines for cell manipulations. With technology scaling, such bitline pair will soon become the bottleneck for further density improvement. In this article we propose a novel common-source-line array architecture, which uses a shared source-line along the row, leaving only one bitline per column. We elaborate the array design to ensure reliability, and demonstrate its effectiveness on STT-MRAM and memristor memory arrays. Our study results show that with comparable latency and energy, the proposed common-source-line array can save 34&percnt; and 33&percnt; area for Memristor-RAM and STT-MRAM respectively, compared with corresponding dual-bitline arrays."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13351","fieldValue":"STT-MRAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13351","fieldValue":"ACM"}
