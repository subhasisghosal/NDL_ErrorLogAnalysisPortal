Unlike the original formulation where the knots of the first parametric coordinate can evolve arbitrarily with respect to the second coordinate, our formulation designs the knot functions as special curves that guarantee a monotonic blending of the knots corresponding to opposite surface boundaries. Furthermore, we demonstrate that local derivatives on the boundary can be described as an ordinary B-spline surface. The latter property allows for constructing smooth transitions between B-spline boundaries with different knot vectors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2631","fieldValue":" We consider maintaining a dynamic set S of N horizontal segments in $&Ropf;^2 such that, given a vertical ray Q in &Ropf;2$, the segments in S intersecting Q can be reported efficiently. In the external memory model, we give a structure that consumes O(N\/B) space, answers a query in O(log$ _BN &plus; K\/B) time (where K is the number of reported segments), and can be updated in O(log B$N) amortized time per insertion and deletion. With B set to a constant, the structure also works in internal memory, consuming space O(N), answering a query in O(log N &plus; K) time, and supporting an update in O(log N) amortized time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2631","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2631","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17242","fieldValue":"Obrien, James F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17242","fieldValue":" We describe a method for detecting physical inconsistencies in lighting from the shading and shadows in an image. This method imposes a multitude of shading- and shadow-based constraints on the projected location of a distant point light source. The consistency of a collection of such constraints is posed as a linear programming problem. A feasible solution indicates that the combination of shading and shadows is physically consistent, while a failure to find a solution provides evidence of photo tampering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17242","fieldValue":"ACM"}
