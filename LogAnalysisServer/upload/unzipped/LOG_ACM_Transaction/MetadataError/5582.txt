Previous works have shown that these regulatory proteins favor specific organizational theme along promoters. Details about how they cooperatively regulate transcriptional process, however, remain unclear. We developed a method to reconstruct a Bayesian network (BN) model representing functional relationships among various transcriptional components. The positive\/negative influence between these components was measured from protein binding and nucleosome occupancy data and embedded into the model. Application on S.cerevisiae ChIP-Chip data showed that the proposed method can recover confirmed relationships, such as Isw1-Pol II, TFIIH-Pol II, TFIIB-TBP, Pol II-H3K36Me3, H3K4Me3-H3K14Ac, etc. Moreover, it can distinguish colocating components from functionally related ones. Novel relationships, e.g., ones between Mediator and chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs), and the combinatorial regulation of Pol II recruitment and activity by CRCs and general transcription factors (GTFs), were also suggested. Conclusion: protein binding events during transcription positively influence each other. Among contributing components, GTFs and CRCs play pivotal roles in transcriptional regulation. These findings provide insights into the regulatory mechanism."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4900","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4900","fieldValue":"Bioinformatics,Proteins,Stability analysis,Genomics,Machinery,Bayesian methods,Data models,nucleosome positioning,Bioinformatics,Proteins,Stability analysis,Genomics,Machinery,Bayesian methods,Data models,chromatin remodeling complex,Transcriptional relationship,Bayesian network,ChIP-Chip data,histone modification"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4901","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4901","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4901","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4902","fieldValue":" We introduce propagation models (PMs), a formalism able to express several kinds of equations that describe the behavior of biochemical reaction networks. Furthermore, we introduce the propagation abstract data type (PADT), which separates concerns regarding different numerical algorithms for the transient analysis of biochemical reaction networks from concerns regarding their implementation, thus allowing for portable and efficient solutions. The state of a propagation abstract data type is given by a vector that assigns mass values to a set of nodes, and its $({\\bf next})$ operator propagates mass values through this set of nodes. We propose an approximate implementation of the $({\\bf next})$ operator, based on threshold abstraction, which propagates only \"significant\" mass values and thus achieves a compromise between efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we give three use cases for propagation models: the chemical master equation (CME), the reaction rate equation (RRE), and a hybrid method that combines these two equations. These three applications use propagation models in order to propagate probabilities and\/or expected values and variances of the model's variables."}
