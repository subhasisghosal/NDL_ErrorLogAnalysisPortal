While good results have been reported, geometric methods are problematic for unstructured grids, widely varying material properties, and varying anisotropies, and they often have difficulty handling constraints arising from collisions. This paper applies the algebraic multigrid method known as smoothed aggregation to cloth simulation. This method is agnostic to the underlying tessellation, which can even vary over time, and it only requires the user to provide a fine-level mesh. To handle contact constraints efficiently, a prefiltered preconditioned conjugate gradient method is introduced. For highly efficient preconditioners, like the ones proposed here, prefiltering is essential, but, even for simple preconditioners, prefiltering provides significant benefits in the presence of many constraints. Numerical tests of the new approach on a range of examples confirm 6--8x speedups on a fully dressed character with 371k vertices, and even larger speedups on synthetic examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17481","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17481","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17482","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study the use of the Chebyshev semi-iterative approach in projective and position-based dynamics. Although projective dynamics is fundamentally nonlinear, its convergence behavior is similar to that of an iterative method solving a linear system. Because of that, we can estimate the \"spectral radius\" and use it in the Chebyshev approach to accelerate the convergence by at least one order of magnitude, when the global step is handled by the direct solver, the Jacobi solver, or even the Gauss-Seidel solver. Our experiment shows that the combination of the Chebyshev approach and the direct solver runs fastest on CPU, while the combination of the Chebyshev approach and the Jacobi solver outperforms any other combination on GPU, as it is highly compatible with parallel computing. Our experiment further shows position-based dynamics can be accelerated by the Chebyshev approach as well, although the effect is less obvious for tetrahedral meshes. The whole approach is simple, fast, effective, GPU-friendly, and has a small memory cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17482","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17482","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17483","fieldValue":" Level sets have been established as highly versatile implicit surface representations, with widespread use in graphics applications including modeling and dynamic simulation. Nevertheless, level sets are often presumed to be limited, compared to explicit meshes, in their ability to represent domains with thin topological features (e.g. narrow slits and gaps) or, even worse, material overlap. Geometries with such features may arise from modeling tools that tolerate occasional self-intersections, fracture modeling algorithms that create narrow or zero-width cuts by design, or as transient states in collision processing pipelines for deformable objects. Converting such models to level sets can alter their topology if thin features are not resolved by the grid size. We argue that this ostensible limitation is not an inherent defect of the implicit surface concept, but a collateral consequence of the standard Cartesian lattice used to store the level set values. We propose storing signed distance values on a regular hexahedral mesh which can have multiple collocated cubic elements and non-manifold bifurcation to accommodate non-trivial topology. We show how such non-manifold level sets can be systematically generated from convenient alternative geometric representations. Finally we demonstrate how this representation can facilitate fast and robust treatment of self-collision in simulations of volumetric elastic deformable bodies."}
