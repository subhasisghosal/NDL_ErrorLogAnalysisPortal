To analyze these models, one must compute the probability distribution over system states at a given time point. Doing this exactly is infeasible for large models; hence one must use approximate algorithms. The Factored Frontier algorithm (FF) is one such algorithm [CHECK END OF SENTENCE]. However FF as well as the earlier Boyen-Koller (BK) algorithm [CHECK END OF SENTENCE] can incur large errors. To address this, we present a new approximate algorithm called the Hybrid Factored Frontier (HFF) algorithm. At each time slice, in addition to maintaining probability distributions over local statesâ\u20AC\u201Das FF doesâ\u20AC\u201DHFF explicitly maintains the probabilities of a number of global states called spikes. When the number of spikes is 0, we get FF and with all global states as spikes, we get the exact inference algorithm. We show that by increasing the number of spikes one can reduce errors while the additional computational effort required is only quadratic in the number of spikes. We validated the performance of HFF on large DBN models of biopathways. Each pathway has more than 30 species and the corresponding DBN has more than 3,000 nodes. Comparisons with FF and BK show that HFF is a useful and powerful approximate inferencing algorithm for DBNs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4818","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4818","fieldValue":"Biological system modeling,Mathematical model,Trajectory,Approximation algorithms,Probability distribution,Approximation methods,Computational modeling,life and medical sciences&#x2014"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4819","fieldValue":" Our work focuses on bone remodeling with a multiscale breadth that ranges from modeling intracellular and intercellular RANK\/RANKL signaling to tissue dynamics, by developing a multilevel modeling framework. Several important findings provide clear evidences of the multiscale properties of bone formation and of the links between RANK\/RANKL and bone density in healthy and disease conditions. Recent studies indicate that the circulating levels of OPG and RANKL are inversely related to bone turnover and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and contribute to the development of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and thalassemic patients. We make use of a spatial process algebra, the Shape Calculus, to control stochastic cell agents that are continuously remodeling the bone. We found that our description is effective for such a multiscale, multilevel process and that RANKL signaling small dynamic concentration defects are greatly amplified by the continuous alternation of absorption and formation resulting in large structural bone defects. This work contributes to the computational modeling of complex systems with a multilevel approach connecting formal languages and agent-based simulation tools."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4819","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4819","fieldValue":"Bones,Shape,Three dimensional displays,Calculus,Computational modeling,Biological system modeling,Osteoporosis,agent-based simulation.,Osteoporosis,multilevel,shape calculus,bone remodeling,multiscale,RANK\/RANKL"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4819","fieldValue":"ACM"}
