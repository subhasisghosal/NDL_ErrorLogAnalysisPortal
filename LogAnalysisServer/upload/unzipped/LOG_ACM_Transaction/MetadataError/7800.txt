{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10415","fieldValue":" Most of the commercial peer-to-peer (P2P) video streaming deployments support hundreds of channels and are referred to as multichannel systems. Recent research studies have proposed specific protocols to improve the streaming quality for all channels by enabling cross-channel cooperation among multiple channels. In this paper, we focus on the following fundamental problems in designing cooperating multichannel systems: 1) what are the general characteristics of existing and potential designs? and 2) under what circumstances should a particular design be used to achieve the desired streaming quality with the lowest implementation complexity? To answer the first question, we propose simple models based on linear programming and network-flow graphs for three general designs, namely Naive Bandwidth allocation Approach (NBA), Passive Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (PCA), and Active Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (ACA), which provide insight into understanding the key characteristics of cross-channel resource sharing. For the second question, we first develop closed-form results for two-channel systems. Then, we use extensive numerical simulations to compare the three designs for various peer population distributions, upload bandwidth distributions, and channel structures. Our analytical and simulation results show that: 1) the NBA design can rarely achieve the desired streaming quality in general cases; 2) the PCA design can achieve the same performance as the ACA design in general cases; and 3) the ACA design should be used for special applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10415","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10416","fieldValue":" Recently, dynamic spectrum sharing has been gaining interest as a potential solution to scarcity of available spectrum. We investigate the problem of designing a secondary spectrum-trading market when there are multiple sellers and multiple buyers and propose a general framework for the trading market based on an auction mechanism. To this end, we first introduce a new optimal auction mechanism, called the generalized Branco's mechanism (GBM). The GBM, which is both incentive-compatible and individually rational, is used to determine the assigned frequency bands and prices for them. Second, we assume that buyers of the spectrum are selfish and model their interaction as a noncooperative game. Using this model, we prove that when the sellers employ the GBM to vend their frequency bands, they can guarantee themselves the largest expected profits by selling their frequency bands jointly. Third, based on the previous finding, we model the interaction among the sellers as a cooperative game and demonstrate that, for any fixed strategies of the buyers, the core of the cooperative game is nonempty. This suggests that there exists a way for the sellers to share the profits from the joint sale of the spectrum so that no subset of sellers will find it beneficial to vend their frequency bands separately without the remaining sellers. Finally, we propose a profit-sharing scheme that can achieve any expected profit vector in the nonempty core of the cooperative game while satisfying two desirable properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10416","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10417","fieldValue":" There are several analytical results on distributed hash tables (DHTs) that can tolerate Byzantine faults. Unfortunately, in such systems, operations such as data retrieval and message sending incur significant communication costs. For example, a simple scheme used in many Byzantine fault-tolerant DHT constructions of n nodes requires $O(log^3 n) messages; this is likely impractical for real-world applications. The previous best known message complexity is O(log2 n) in expectation. However, the corresponding protocol suffers from prohibitive costs owing to hidden constants in the asymptotic notation and setup costs. In this paper, we focus on reducing the communication costs against a computationally bounded adversary. We employ threshold cryptography and distributed key generation to define two protocols, both of which are more efficient than existing solutions. In comparison, our first protocol is deterministic with O(log2$ n) message complexity, and our second protocol is randomized with expected O(log n) message complexity. Furthermore, both the hidden constants and setup costs for our protocols are small, and no trusted third party is required. Finally, we present results from microbenchmarks conducted over PlanetLab showing that our protocols are practical for deployment under significant levels of churn and adversarial behavior."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10417","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
