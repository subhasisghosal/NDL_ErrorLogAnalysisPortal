Applications of TAS range from online self-optimization of in-production applications to the automatic generation of QoS\/cost-driven elastic scaling policies, as well as to support for what-if analysis on the scalability of transactional applications. In this article, we present the key innovation at the core of TAS, namely, a novel performance forecasting methodology that relies on the joint usage of analytical modeling and machine learning. By exploiting these two classically competing approaches in a synergic fashion, TAS achieves the best of the two worlds, namely, high extrapolation power and good accuracy, even when faced with complex workloads deployed over public cloud infrastructures. We demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of TASâ\u20AC™s performance forecasting methodology via an extensive experimental study based on a fully fledged prototype implementation integrated with a popular open-source in-memory transactional data grid (Red Hatâ\u20AC™s Infinispan) and industry-standard benchmarks generating a breadth of heterogeneous workloads."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1294","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1294","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3854","fieldValue":"Van Walstijn, Maarten"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3854","fieldValue":" Due to its efficiency and simplicity, the finite-difference time-domain method is becoming a popular choice for solving wideband, transient problems in various fields of acoustics. So far, the issue of extracting a binaural response from finite difference simulations has only been discussed in the context of embedding a listener geometry in the grid. In this paper, we propose and study a method for binaural response rendering based on a spatial decomposition of the sound field. The finite difference grid is locally sampled using a volumetric array of receivers, from which a plane wave density function is computed and integrated with free-field head related transfer functions, in the spherical harmonics domain. The volumetric array is studied in terms of numerical robustness and spatial aliasing. Analytic formulas that predict the performance of the array are developed, facilitating spatial resolution analysis and numerical binaural response analysis for a number of finite difference schemes. Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of numerical dispersion on array processing and on the resulting binaural responses. Our method is compared to a binaural simulation based on the image method. Results indicate good spatial and temporal agreement between the two methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3854","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3854","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3855","fieldValue":"Huang, Po-Sen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3855","fieldValue":"Hasegawa-Johnson, Mark"}
