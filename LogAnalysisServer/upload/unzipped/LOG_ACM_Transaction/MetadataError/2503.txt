Weisfeld later demonstrated that Forsythe's approach could be extended to polynomials in an arbitrary number of variables. In this paper we sharpen Weisfeld's results and present a method for computing weighted, multinomial, least-squares approximations to given data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18472","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18472","fieldValue":"ACM"}
