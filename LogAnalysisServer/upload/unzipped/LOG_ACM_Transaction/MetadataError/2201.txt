However, most of those techniques require a pre-labeled model with some semantic information. We introduce a fully automatic approach to simultaneously segment and detect similarities within an existing 3D architectural model. Our framework approaches the segmentation problem as a weighted minimum set cover over an input triangle soup, and maximizes the repetition of similar segments to find a best set of unique component types and instances. The solution for this set-cover formulation starts with a search space reduction to eliminate unlikely combinations of triangles, and continues with a combinatorial optimization within each disjoint subspace that outputs the components and their types. We show the discovered components of a variety of architectural models obtained from public databases. We demonstrate experiments testing the robustness of our algorithm, in terms of threshold sensitivity, vertex displacement, and triangulation variations of the original model. In addition, we compare our components with those of competing approaches and evaluate our results against user-based segmentations. We have processed a database of 50 buildings, with various structures and over 200K polygons per building, with a segmentation time averaging up to 4 minutes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17352","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17352","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17353","fieldValue":" We present a method for controlling the output of procedural modeling programs using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Previous probabilistic methods for controlling procedural models use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which receives control feedback only for completely-generated models. In contrast, SMC receives feedback incrementally on incomplete models, allowing it to reallocate computational resources and converge quickly. To handle the many possible sequentializations of a structured, recursive procedural modeling program, we develop and prove the correctness of a new SMC variant, Stochastically-Ordered Sequential Monte Carlo (SOSMC). We implement SOSMC for general-purpose programs using a new programming primitive: the stochastic future. Finally, we show that SOSMC reliably generates high-quality outputs for a variety of programs and control scoring functions. For small computational budgets, SOSMC's outputs often score nearly twice as high as those of MCMC or normal SMC."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17353","fieldValue":"ACM"}
