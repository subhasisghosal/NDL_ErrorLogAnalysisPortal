We have developed three visualization and animation tools that demonstrate various information security concepts and actively engage learners. The information security concepts illustrated include: packet sniffer and related computer network concepts, the Kerberos authentication architecture, and wireless network attacks. These tools are implemented using Macromedia Flash MX Professional Edition. The animations can run from a Web page as Flash Applets or as standalone applications. These visualization tools are intended to be used in undergraduate level computer network and security courses. They can be used as classroom instructor demos, student exercises, or Web-based student learning resources. These tools have been used in various computer network and information security courses at North Carolina A&T State University, and have received positive feedback from the students."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/11096","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"10.1145.1656255.1656258\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11096","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11096","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11097","fieldValue":"Meerbaum--Salant, Orni"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11097","fieldValue":" This article describes the construction process and evaluation of the Agile Constructionist Mentoring Methodology (ACMM), a mentoring method for guiding software development projects in the high school. The need for such a methodology has arisen due to the complexity of mentoring software project development in the high school. We introduce the ACMM and suggest a year-long mentoring template that includes the practices required for the actual mentoring process. The evaluation of the ACMM reveals that the methodology addresses each of the challenges teachers cope with during the mentoring process, which were identified in the first phase of the research."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/11097","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"10.1145.1656255.1656259\"}"}
