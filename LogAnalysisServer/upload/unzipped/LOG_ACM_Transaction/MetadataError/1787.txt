It provides a high-resolution result in both the spatial and angular domains by decomposing reflectance measurement into two lower-dimensional phases. The first acquires representatives of high angular dimension but sampled sparsely over the surface, while the second acquires keys of low angular dimension but sampled densely over the surface. We develop a hand-held, high-speed BRDF capturing device for phase one measurements. A condenser-based optical setup collects a dense hemisphere of rays emanating from a single point on the target sample as it is manually scanned over it, yielding 10 BRDF point measurements per second. Lighting directions from 6 LEDs are applied at each measurement; these are amplified to a full 4D BRDF using the general (NDF-tabulated) microfacet model. The second phase captures N=20-200 images of the entire sample from a fixed view and lit by a varying area source. We show that the resulting N-dimensional keys capture much of the distance information in the original BRDF space, so that they effectively discriminate among representatives, though they lack sufficient angular detail to reconstruct the SVBRDF by themselves. At each surface position, a local linear combination of a small number of neighboring representatives is computed to match each key, yielding a high-resolution SVBRDF. A quick capture session (10-20 minutes) on simple devices yields results showing sharp and anisotropic specularity and rich spatial detail."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16304","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16304","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16305","fieldValue":" We present a novel optical setup and processing pipeline for measuring the 3D geometry and spatially-varying surface reflectance of physical objects. Central to our design is a digital camera and a high frequency spatially-modulated light source aligned to share a common focal point and optical axis. Pairs of such devices allow capturing a sequence of images from which precise measurements of geometry and reflectance can be recovered. Our approach is enabled by two technical contributions: a new active multiview stereo algorithm and an analysis of light descattering that has important implications for image-based reflectometry. We show that the geometry measured by our scanner is accurate to within 50 microns at a resolution of roughly 200 microns and that the reflectance agrees with reference data to within 5.5%. Additionally, we present an image relighting application and show renderings that agree very well with reference images at light and view positions far from those that were initially measured."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16306","fieldValue":" Local image histograms contain a great deal of information useful for applications in computer graphics, computer vision and computational photography. Making use of that information has been challenging because of the expense of computing histogram properties over large neighborhoods. Efficient algorithms exist for some specific computations like the bilateral filter, but not others. Here, we present an efficient and practical method for computing accurate derivatives and integrals of locally-weighted histograms over large neighborhoods. The method allows us to compute the location, height, width and integral of all local histogram modes at interactive rates. Among other things, it enables the first constant-time isotropic median filter, robust isotropic image morphology operators, an efficient \"dominant mode\" filter and a non-iterative alternative to the mean shift. In addition, we present a method to combat the over-sharpening that is typical of histogram-based edge-preserving smoothing. This post-processing step should make histogram-based filters not only fast and efficient, but also suitable for a variety of new applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16306","fieldValue":"ACM"}
