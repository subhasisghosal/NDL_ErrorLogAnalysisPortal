To fulfill the requirements of such a sophisticated retrieval, we propose a document retrieval model and system based on the representation of knowledge describing the semantic contents of documents, the way in which the documents are managed by procedures and by people in the office, and the application domain where the office operates. The article describes the knowledge representation issues needed for the document retrieval system and presents a document retrieval model that captures these issues. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by describing a system, named Kabiria, built on top of such model. The article describes the querying and browsing environments, and the architecture of the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23745","fieldValue":" A software specification language Templar is defined in this article. The development of the language was guided by the following objectives: requirements specifications written in Templar should have a clear syntax and formal semantics, should be easy for a systems analyst to develop and for an end-user to understand, and it should be easy to map them into a broad range of design specifications. Templar is based on temporal logic and on the Activity-Event-Condition-Activity model of a rule which is an extension of the Event-Condition-Activity model in active databases. The language supports a rich set of modeling primitives, including rules, procedures, temporal logic operators, events, activities, hierarchical decomposition of activities, parallelism, and decisions combined together into a cohesive system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23745","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23745","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23746","fieldValue":" Computer users often must view large amounts of information through video displays which are physically limited in size. Although some methods, which automatically display\/erase information units based on their degrees of importance, have been proposed, they lack an ability to keep the total amount of displayed information nearly constant. We propose a new method for information display based on fractal theory. By regarding the information structures used in computers as complex objects, we can abstract these objects as well as control their amount. Using our method, (1) the total amount of information is kept nearly constant even when users change their focuses of attention and (2) this amount can be set flexibly. Through mathematical analysis, we show our method's ability to control the amount. An application to program display is also shown. When this method is applied to the display of structured programs, it provides fisheye-like views which integrate local details around the focal point and major landmarks further away."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23746","fieldValue":"ACM"}
