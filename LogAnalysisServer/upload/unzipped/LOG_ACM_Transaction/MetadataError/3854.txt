In such cases, at least partially relevant documents must be retrieved. We propose a novel multilingual framework, MultiStructPRF, which expands the query with related terms by (i) using a resource-rich assisting language and (ii) giving varied importance to the expansion terms depending on their position of occurrence in the document. Our system uses the help of an assisting language to expand the query in order to improve system recall. We propose a systematic expansion model for weighting the expansion terms coming from different parts of the document. To combine the expansion terms from query language and assisting language, we propose a heuristics-based fusion model. Our experimental results show an improvement over other PRF techniques in both precision and recall for multiple resource-scarce languages like Marathi, Bengali, Odia, Finnish, and the like. We study the effect of different assisting languages on precision and recall for multiple query languages. Our experiments reveal an interesting fact: Precision is positively correlated with the typological closeness of query language and assisting language, whereas recall is positively correlated with the resource richness of the assisting language."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3136","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3136","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22378","fieldValue":" Cloud computing services are becoming more prevalent and readily available today, bringing to us economies of scale and making large-scale computation feasible. Security and privacy considerations, however, stand in the way of fully utilizing the benefits of such services and architectures. In this work we address the problem of secure outsourcing of large-scale biometric experiments to a cloud or grid in a way that the client can verify that with very high probability the task was computed correctly. We conduct thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed techniques and provide implementation results that indicate that our solution imposes modest overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22378","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22378","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22379","fieldValue":" We introduce a new practical mechanism for remote data storage with access pattern privacy and correctness. A storage client can deploy this mechanism to issue encrypted reads, writes, and inserts to a potentially curious and malicious storage service provider, without revealing information or access patterns. The provider is unable to establish any correlation between successive accesses, or even to distinguish between a read and a write. Moreover, the client is provided with strong correctness assurances for its operationsâ\u20AC\u201Dillicit provider behavior does not go undetected. We describe a practical system that can execute an unprecedented several queries per second on terabyte-plus databases while maintaining full computational privacy and correctness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22379","fieldValue":"ACM"}
