Many of the existing work in NLP deals with specific NLP problems in a highly heuristic manner, yet not from an explicit reasoning perspective. Recently, there have been developments on models that allow reasoning in NLP such as language models, logical models, and so on. The goal of this special issue is to present high-quality contributions that integrate reasoning involved in different areas of natural language processing both at theoretical and\/or practical levels. In this article, we give a brief overview on some major aspects of explicating reasoning in NLP and summarize the articles included in this special issue."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2909","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2909","fieldValue":"ACM"}
