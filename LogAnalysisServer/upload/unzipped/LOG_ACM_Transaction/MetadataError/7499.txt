We consider these questions from a networking standpoint assuming point-to-point links, and employ a rigorous physical layer model to model conflict relationships between them. Since we seek capacity results, we assume that the network is operated using an appropriate schedule of conflict-free link activations. We develop and investigate a novel optimization framework to determine the optimal throughput and configuration, i.e., flow routes, link activation schedules and physical layer parameters. Determining the optimal throughput is a computationally hard problem, in general. However, using a smart enumerative technique we obtain numerical results for several different scenarios of interest. We obtain several important insights into the structure of the optimal routes, schedules and physical layer parameters. Besides determining the achievable throughput, we believe that our optimization-based framework can also be used as a tool, for configuring scheduled wireless networks, such as those based on IEEE 802.16."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9806","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9807","fieldValue":" In this paper we study the asymptotic minimum energy (which is defined as the minimum transporting energy) required to transport (via multiple hops) data packets from a source to a destination. Under the assumptions that nodes are distributed according to a Poisson point process with node density n in a unit-area square and the distance between a source and a destination is of constant order, we prove that the minimum transporting energy is Θ $(n^(1-α)\/2) with probability approaching one as the node density goes to infinity, where α is the path loss exponent. We demonstrate use of the derived results to obtain the bounds of the capacity of wireless networks that operate in UWB. In particular, we prove the transport capacity of UWB-operated networks is Θ (n(α-1)\/2$) with high probability. We also carry out simulations to validate the derived results and to estimate the constant factor associated with the bounds on the minimum energy. The simulation results indicate that the constant associated with the minimum energy converges to the source-destination distance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9807","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9807","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9807","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9808","fieldValue":" We consider a one-hop wireless network with independent time varying ON\/OFF channels and N users, such as a multi-user uplink or downlink. We first show that general classes of scheduling algorithms that do not consider queue backlog must incur average delay that grows at least linearly with N. We then construct a dynamic queue-length aware algorithm that maximizes throughput and achieves an average delay that is independent of N. This is the first order-optimal delay result for opportunistic scheduling with asymmetric links. The delay bounds are achieved via a technique of queue grouping together with Lyapunov drift and statistical multiplexing concepts."}
