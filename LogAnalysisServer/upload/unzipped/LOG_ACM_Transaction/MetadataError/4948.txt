This article reviews several of the personalization solutions provided to date and proposes two hypotheses: (A) an incremental machine learning approach is better suited to the preference learning problem as opposed to the commonly employed batch learning techniques, (B) temporal data related to the duration that user context states and preference settings endure is a beneficial input to a preference learning solution. These two hypotheses are the cornerstones of the Dynamic Incremental Associative Neural NEtwork (DIANNE) developed as a tailored solution to preference learning in a pervasive environment. DIANNE has been evaluated in two ways: first, by applying it to benchmark datasets to test DIANNE's performance and scalability as a machine learning solution; second, by end-users in live trials to determine the validity of the proposed hypotheses and to evaluate DIANNE's utility as a preference learning solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/1267","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2451248.2451253\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3523","fieldValue":" We introduce coefficient K, defined on a novel parametric scale, derived from processing a traditionally eye-tracked time course of eye movements. Positive and negative ordinates of K indicate focal or ambient viewing, respectively, while the abscissa serves to indicate time, so that K acts as a dynamic indicator of fluctuation between ambient\/focal visual behavior. The coefficient indicates the difference between fixation duration and its subsequent saccade amplitude expressed in standard deviation units, facilitating parametric statistical testing. To validate K empirically, we test its utility by capturing ambient and focal attention during serial and parallel visual search tasks (Study 1). We then show how K quantitatively depicts the difference in scanning behaviors when attention is guided by audio description during perception of art (Study 2)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3524","fieldValue":" Blur is an important attribute in the study and modeling of the human visual system. In the blur discrimination experiments, just-noticeable additional blur required to differentiate from the reference blur level is measured. The past studies on blur discrimination have measured the sensitivity of the human visual system to blur using two-dimensional (2D) test patterns. In this study, subjective tests are performed to measure blur discrimination thresholds using stereoscopic 3D test patterns. Specifically, how the binocular disparity affects the blur sensitivity is measured on a passive stereoscopic display. A passive stereoscopic display renders the left and right eye images in a row interleaved format. The subjects have to wear circularly polarized glasses to filter the appropriate images to the left and right eyes. Positive, negative, and zero disparity values are considered in these experiments. A positive disparity value projects the objects behind the display screen, a negative disparity value projects the objects in front of the display screen, and a zero disparity value projects the objects at the display plane. The blur discrimination thresholds are measured for both symmetric and asymmetric stereo viewing cases. In the symmetric viewing case, the same level of additional blur is applied to the left and right eye stimulus. In the asymmetric viewing case, different levels of additional blur are applied to the left and right eye stimuli. The results of this study indicate that, in the symmetric stereo viewing case, binocular disparity does not affect the blur discrimination thresholds for the selected 3D test patterns. As a consequence of these findings, we conclude that the models developed for 2D blur discrimination can be used for 3D blur discrimination. We also show that the Weber model provides a good fit to the blur discrimination threshold measurements for the symmetric stereo viewing case. In the asymmetric viewing case, the blur discrimination thresholds decreased, and the decrease in threshold values is found to be dominated by eye observing the higher blur."}
