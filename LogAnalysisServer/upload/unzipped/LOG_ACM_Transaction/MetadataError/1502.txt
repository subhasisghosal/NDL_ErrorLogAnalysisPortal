To animate small-scale details of incompressible viscous multi-phase fluids realistically, we focus on the discontinuities in the state variables that express these properties. Surface tension of both free and bubble surfaces is modeled using the jump condition in the pressure field; and discontinuities in the velocity gradient field. driven by viscosity differences, are also considered. To obtain derivatives of the pressure and velocity fields with sub-grid accuracy, they are extrapolated across interfaces using continuous variables based on physical properties. The numerical methods that we present are easy to implement and do not impact the performance of existing solvers. Small-scale fluid motions, such as capillary instability, breakup of liquid sheets, and bubbly water can all be successfully animated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15575","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15575","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15576","fieldValue":" We present a physically-based method to enforce contact angles at the intersection of fluid free surfaces and solid objects, allowing us to simulate a variety of small-scale fluid phenomena including water drops on surfaces. The heart of this technique is a virtual surface method, which modifies the level set distance field representing the fluid surface in order to maintain an appropriate contact angle. The surface tension that is calculated on the contact line between the solid surface and liquid surface can then capture all interfacial tensions, including liquid-solid, liquid-air and solid-air tensions. We use a simple dynamic contact angle model to select contact angles according to the solid material property, water history, and the fluid front's motion. Our algorithm robustly and accurately treats various drop shape deformations, and handles both flat and curved solid surfaces. Our results show that our algorithm is capable of realistically simulating several small-scale liquid phenomena such as beading and flattened drops, stretched and separating drops, suspended drops on curved surfaces, and capillary action."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15576","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15576","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15577","fieldValue":" We introduce CrossY, a simple drawing application developed as a benchmark to demonstrate the feasibility of goal-crossing as the basis for a graphical user interface.
