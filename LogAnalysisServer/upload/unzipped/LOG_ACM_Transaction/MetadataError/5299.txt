Small changes in gap penalties, for example, can yield radically different alignments. A rigorous way to compute parameter values that are appropriate for aligning biological sequences is through inverse parametric sequence alignment. Given a collection of examples of biologically correct alignments, this is the problem of finding parameter values that make the scores of the example alignments close to those of optimal alignments for their sequences. We extend prior work on inverse parametric alignment to partial examples, which contain regions where the alignment is left unspecified, and to an improved formulation based on minimizing the average error between the score of an example and the score of an optimal alignment. Experiments on benchmark biological alignments show we can find parameters that generalize across protein families and that boost the accuracy of multiple sequence alignment by as much as 25%."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4385","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4385","fieldValue":"Pattern matching, Analysis of Algorithms and Problem Complexity, Linear programming, Biology and genetics"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4385","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4385","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4386","fieldValue":" The representation of a genome by oligonucleotide probes is a prerequisite for the analysis of many of its basic properties, such as transcription factor binding sites, chromosomal breakpoints, gene expression of known genes and detection of novel genes, in particular those coding for small RNAs. An ideal representation would consist of a high density set of oligonucleotides with similar melting temperatures that do not cross-hybridize with other regions of the genome and are equidistantly spaced. The implementation of such design is typically called a tiling array or genome array. We formulate the minimal cost tiling path problem for the selection of oligonucleotides from a set of candidates. Computing the selection of probes requires multi-criterion optimization, which we cast into a shortest path problem. Standard algorithms running in linear time allow us to compute globally optimal tiling paths from millions of candidate oligonucleotides on a standard desktop computer for most problem variants. The solutions to this multi-criterion optimization are spatially adaptive to the problem instance. Our formulation incorporates experimental constraints with respect to specific regions of interest and trade offs between hybridization parameters, probe quality and tiling density easily."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4386","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4386","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4386","fieldValue":"ACM"}
