The IHM allows the interrupt handler to be migrated from the interrupt handler thread to the corresponding target process so that additional context switch can be avoided and the cache hit ratio with respect to the data generated by the interrupt handler can be improved. In addition, the DIS allows the shortest path reserved for urgent interrupt-process pairs to be laid between the interrupt arrival and target process by dividing a series of interrupt-driven operations into nondeferrable and deferrable operations. Both the IHM and DIS can be combined in a natural way and can operate concurrently. These techniques can be applied to all kinds of interrupt handlers with no modification to them. The proposed techniques not only reduce the scheduling latency, but also resolve the interrupt-driven priority inversion problem. We implemented a prototype in the Linux 2.6.19 kernel after adding real-time patches. Experimental results show that the scheduling latency is significantly reduced by up to 84.2&percnt; when both techniques are applied together. When the Linux OS runs on an ARM-based embedded CPU running at 200MHz, the scheduling latency can become as low as 30Î¼s, which is much closer to the hardware-specific limitations. By lowering the scheduling latency, the limited CPU cycles can be consumed more for user-level processes and less for system-level tasks, such as interrupt handling and scheduling."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6458","fieldValue":"Interrupt handler migration and direct interrupt scheduling for rapid scheduling of interrupt-driven tasks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6459","fieldValue":" In this article, we present Microsearch, a search system suitable for embedded devices used in ubiquitous computing environments. Akin to a desktop search engine, Microsearch indexes the information inside a small device, and accurately resolves a user's queries. Given the limited hardware, conventional search engine design and algorithms cannot be used. We adopt Information Retrieval (IR) techniques for query resolution, and proposed a new space-efficient top-k query resolution algorithm. A theoretical model of Microsearch is given to better understand the trade-offs in design parameters. Evaluation is done via actual implementation on off-the-shelf hardware."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6459","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6459","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6460","fieldValue":"Higuera-Toledano, M.
