The estimators were constructed by applying a quadratic function to a vector obtained from iterated integrations of the simulation output. The previous article concentrated on deriving the limiting distributions of the estimators and on their computational efficiency for a particular choice of quadratic function. The present article considers estimators constructed from different quadratic functions, chosen mainly to reduce bias compared to the estimators of the previous article. Overlapping and nonoverlapping batch means versions of the estimators are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24979","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24979","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24980","fieldValue":" We propose an indifference-zone approach for a ranking and selection problem with the goal of reducing both the number of simulated samples of the performance and the frequency of configuration changes. We prove that with a prespecified high probability, our algorithm finds the best system configuration. Our proof hinges on several ideas, including the use of Anderson's probability bound, that have not been fully investigated for the ranking and selection problem. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm can select the best system configuration using up to 50&percnt; fewer simulated samples than existing algorithms without increasing the frequency of configuration changes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24981","fieldValue":"Vzquez-Abad, Felisa J."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24981","fieldValue":" This article presents a comparison of different gradient estimators for the sensitivity of waiting times in a bulk server system. Inspired by a transportation network, our model is that of a bursty arrival process that waits at a â\u20ACœplatformâ\u20AC? until the server is available (representing a train or bus ready for departure). At the departure epochs, all waiting passengers leave at once. The departure process is assumed to be a renewal process and, based on a limiting result, the interdeparture times are approximated by truncated normal random variables. The interarrival times are assumed to be identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.), with a general distribution of bounded density. We are interested in calculating the sensitivities of the total cumulative waiting time of all passengers with respect to the interdeparture times. For this general model where neither the interarrival times nor the interdeparture times are exponential, there is no analytical formula available. However, the estimation of such sensitivities is an important problem for flow control in such networks. We establish a Smoothed Perturbation Analysis (SPA), a Measure-Valued Differentiation (MVD), and a Score Function (SF) estimator, including numerical experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24981","fieldValue":"ACM"}
