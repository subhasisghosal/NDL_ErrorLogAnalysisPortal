We reduce contrast in low-contrast regions using an approximation to anisotropic diffusion, and artificially increase contrast in higher contrast regions with difference-of-Gaussian edges. The abstraction step is extensible and allows for artistic or data-driven control. Abstracted images can optionally be stylized using soft color quantization to create cartoon-like effects with good temporal coherence. Our framework design is highly parallel, allowing for a GPU-based, real-time implementation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our abstraction framework with a user-study and find that participants are faster at naming abstracted faces of known persons compared to photographs. Participants are also better at remembering abstracted images of arbitrary scenes in a memory task."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15735","fieldValue":" The contour generator is an important visibility feature of a smooth object seen under parallel projection. It is the curve on the surface which seperates front-facing from back-facing regions. The apparent contour is the projection of the contour generator onto a plane perpendicular to the view direction. Both curves play an important role in computer graphics.Our goal is to obtain fast and robust algorithms that compute the contour generator with a guarantee of topological correctness. To this end, we first study the singularities of the contour generator and apparent contour for both generic views and generic time-dependent projections, for example, when the surface is rotated or deformed. The singularities indicate when components of the contour generator merge or split as time evolves.We present an algorithm to compute an initial contour generator by using a dynamic step size. An interval test guarantees the topological correctness. This initial contour generator can thus be maintained under a time-dependent projection by examining its singularities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15735","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15735","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2491","fieldValue":" In the mobile facility location problem, which is a variant of the classical facility location, each facility and client is assigned to a start location in a metric graph and our goal is to find a destination node for each client and facility such that every client is sent to a node which is the destination of some facility. The quality of a solution can be measured either by the total distance clients and facilities travel or by the maximum distance traveled by any client or facility. As we show in this article (by an approximation-preserving reduction), the problem of minimizing the total movement of facilities and clients generalizes the classical k-median problem. The class of movement problems was introduced by Demaine et al. [2007] where a simple 2-approximation was proposed for the minimum maximum movement mobile facility location problem while an approximation for the minimum total movement variant and hardness results for both were left as open problems. Our main result here is an 8-approximation algorithm for the minimum total movement mobile facility location problem. Our algorithm is obtained by rounding an LP relaxation in five phases. For the minimum maximum movement mobile facility location problem, we show that we cannot have a better than a 2-approximation for the problem, unless P&equals;NP so the simple algorithm proposed by Demaine et al. [2007] is essentially best possible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2491","fieldValue":"ACM"}
