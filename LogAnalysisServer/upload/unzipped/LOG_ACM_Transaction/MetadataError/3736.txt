In this article, we focus on developing efficient methods for LM construction. Our main contribution is that we propose a Natural N-grams based Converting (NNGC) method for transforming a Continuous-Space Language Model (CSLM) to a Back-off N-gram Language Model (BNLM). Furthermore, a Bilingual LM Pruning (BLMP) approach is developed for enhancing LMs in SMT decoding and speeding up CSLM converting. The proposed pruning and converting methods can convert a large LM efficiently by working jointly. That is, a LM can be effectively pruned before it is converted from CSLM without sacrificing performance, and further improved if an additional corpus contains out-of-domain information. For different SMT tasks, our experimental results indicate that the proposed NNGC and BLMP methods outperform the existing counterpart approaches significantly in BLEU and computational cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3104","fieldValue":"Converting Continuous-Space Language Models into N-gram Language Models with Efficient Bilingual Pruning for Statistical Machine Translation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3104","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3104","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22087","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22087","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22087","fieldValue":"ACM"}
