The nearly orthogonal Latin hypercube and the generalized Halton sequence are two popular methods when it comes to generate low-discrepancy sequences. In this article, we propose to use evolutionary algorithms in order to find optimized solutions to the combinatorial problem of configuring generators of these sequences. Experimental results show that the optimized sequence generators behave at least as well as generators from the literature for the Halton sequence and significantly better for the nearly orthogonal Latin hypercube."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25048","fieldValue":" Quantiles, which are also known as values-at-risk in finance, frequently arise in practice as measures of risk. This article develops asymptotically valid confidence intervals for quantiles estimated via simulation using variance-reduction techniques (VRTs). We establish our results within a general framework for VRTs, which we show includes importance sampling, stratified sampling, antithetic variates, and control variates. Our method for verifying asymptotic validity is to first demonstrate that a quantile estimator obtained via a VRT within our framework satisfies a Bahadur-Ghosh representation. We then exploit this to show that the quantile estimator obeys a central limit theorem (CLT) and to develop a consistent estimator for the variance constant appearing in the CLT, which enables us to construct a confidence interval. We provide explicit formulae for the estimators for each of the VRTs considered."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25048","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25048","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3423","fieldValue":"Creem-Regehr, Sarah"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3423","fieldValue":" Understanding how users perceive 3D geometric objects can provide a basis for creating more effective tools for visualization in applications such as CAD or medical imaging. This article examines how orientation indicators affect users' accuracy in perceiving the shape of a 3D object shown as multiple views. Multiple views force users to infer the orientation of an object and recognize corresponding features between distinct vantage points. These are difficult tasks, and not all users are able to carry them out accurately. We use a cognitive experimental paradigm to evaluate the effectiveness of two types of orientation indicators on a person's ability to compare views of objects presented in different orientations. The orientation indicators implemented were colocated, which shared a center-point with the 3D object, or noncolocated with (displaced from) the 3D object. The study accounts for additional factors including object complexity, axis of rotation, and users' individual differences in spatial abilities. Our results show that an orientation indicator helps users in comparing multiple views, and that the effect is influenced by the type of aid, a person's spatial ability, and the difficulty of the task. In addition to establishing an effect of an orientation indicator, this article helps demonstrate the application of a particular experimental paradigm and analysis, as well as the importance of considering individual differences when designing interface aids."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3423","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3423","fieldValue":"ACM"}
