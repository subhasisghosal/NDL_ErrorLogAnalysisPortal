We develop a practical theory of micro-solar power systems that is materialized in a simulation suite that models component and system behavior over a long time scale and in an external environment that depends on time, location, weather, and local variations. This simulation provides sufficient accuracy to guide specific design choices in a large design space. Unlike the many macro-solar calculators, this design tool models detailed behavior of milliwatt systems in the worst conditions, rather than typical behavior of kilowatt systems in the best conditions. Our simulation suite is validated with a concrete design of micro-solar power systems, the HydroWatch node. With our simulation suite, micro-solar power systems can be designed in a systematic fashion. Putting the model and empirical vehicle together, the design choices in each component of a micro-solar power system are studied to reach a deployable candidate. The deployment is evaluated by analyzing the effects of different solar profiles across the network. The analysis from the deployment can be used to refine the next system-design iteration."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3040","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose the first work that investigates the feasibility of Arabic discourse segmentation into elementary discourse units within the segmented discourse representation theory framework. We first describe our annotation scheme that defines a set of principles to guide the segmentation process. Two corpora have been annotated according to this scheme: elementary school textbooks and newspaper documents extracted from the syntactically annotated Arabic Treebank. Then, we propose a multiclass supervised learning approach that predicts nested units. Our approach uses a combination of punctuation, morphological, lexical, and shallow syntactic features. We investigate how each feature contributes to the learning process. We show that an extensive morphological analysis is crucial to achieve good results in both corpora. In addition, we show that adding chunks does not boost the performance of our system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3040","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3040","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21406","fieldValue":" Multi-channel communications can effectively reduce channel competition and interference in a wireless sensor network and thus achieve increased throughput and improved end-to-end delay guarantees with reduced power consumption. However, existing work relies only on a small number of orthogonal channels, resulting in degraded performance when a large number of data flows need to be transmitted on different channels. In this article, we conduct empirical studies to investigate interferences among overlapping channels. Our results show that overlapping channels can also be utilized for improved real-time performance if the node transmission power is carefully configured. In order to minimize the overall transmission power consumption of a network with multiple data flows under end-to-end delay constraints, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to configure the transmission power level of every node and assign overlapping channels to different data flows. Since the optimization problem has an exponential computational complexity, we then present a heuristic algorithm designed based on simulated annealing to find a suboptimal solution. Our extensive empirical results on a 33-mote testbed demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better real-time performance and less power consumption than two baselines, including a scheme using only orthogonal channels."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21406","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2422966.2422967\"}"}
