This is because the biclustering approach, in contrast to the conventional clustering techniques, focuses on finding a subset of the genes and a subset of the experimental conditions that together exhibit coherent behavior. However, the biclustering problem is inherently intractable, and it is often computationally costly to find biclusters with high levels of coherence. In this work, we propose a novel biclustering algorithm that exploits the zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZBDDs) data structure to cope with the computational challenges. Our method can find all biclusters that satisfy specific input conditions, and it is scalable to practical gene expression data. We also present experimental results confirming the effectiveness of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4219","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4219","fieldValue":"Discovering Coherent Biclusters from Gene Expression Data Using Zero-Suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4219","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4219","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4220","fieldValue":"Kao, Ching-Pin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4220","fieldValue":" Clustering analysis has been an important research topic in the machine learning field due to the wide applications. In recent years, it has even become a valuable and useful tool for in-silico analysis of microarray or gene expression data. Although a number of clustering methods have been proposed, they are confronted with difficulties in meeting the requirements of automation, high quality, and high efficiency at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel, parameterless and efficient clustering algorithm, namely, Correlation Search Technique (CST), which fits for analysis of gene expression data. The unique feature of CST is it incorporates the validation techniques into the clustering process so that high quality clustering results can be produced on the fly. Through experimental evaluation, CST is shown to outperform other clustering methods greatly in terms of clustering quality, efficiency, and automation on both of synthetic and real data sets."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4220","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
