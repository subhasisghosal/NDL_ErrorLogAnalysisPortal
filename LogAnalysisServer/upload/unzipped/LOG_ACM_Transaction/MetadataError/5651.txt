Unsupervised learning has the advantage of compensating for missing annotated data, and is thus promising to be effective to identify cis-regulatory elements and modules. We introduced a Conditional Random Fields model, referred to as CRFEM, to integrate sequence features and long-range dependency of genomic sequences such as epigenetic features to identify cis-regulatory elements and modules at the same time. The proposed method is able to automatically learn model parameters with no labeled data and explicitly optimize the predictive probability of cis-regulatory elements and modules. In comparison with existing methods, our method is more accurate and can be used for genome-wide studies of gene regulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5023","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5023","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5023","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1429","fieldValue":" Many deaf adults in the United States have difficulty reading written English text; computer animations of American Sign Language (ASL) can improve these individualsâ\u20AC™ access to information, communication, and services. Planning and scripting the movements of a virtual characterâ\u20AC™s arms and body to perform a grammatically correct and understandable ASL sentence is a difficult task, and the timing subtleties of the animation can be particularly challenging. After examining the psycholinguistics literature on the speed and timing of ASL, we have designed software to calculate realistic timing of the movements in ASL animations. We have built algorithms to calculate the time-duration of signs and the location\/length of pauses during an ASL animation. To determine whether our software can improve the quality of ASL animations, we conducted a study in which native ASL signers evaluated the ASL animations processed by our algorithms. We have found that: (1) adding linguistically motivated pauses and variations in sign-durations improved signersâ\u20AC™ performance on a comprehension task and (2) these animations were rated as more understandable by ASL signers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1429","fieldValue":"ACM"}
