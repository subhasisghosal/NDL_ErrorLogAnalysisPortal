Recently, related studies have shown the feasibility of identifying RFID-enabled devices based on physical-layer fingerprints. In this work, we leverage on these findings and demonstrate that physical-layer identification of HF RFID devices is also practical, that is, can achieve high accuracy and stability. We propose an improved hardware setup and enhanced techniques for fingerprint extraction and matching. Our new system enables device identification with an Equal Error Rate as low as 0.005 (0.5&percnt;) on a set 50 HF RFID smart cards of the same manufacturer and type. We further investigate the fingerprint stability over an extended period of time and across different acquisition setups. In the latter case, we propose a solution based on channel equalization that preserves the fingerprint quality across setups. Our results strengthen the practical use of physical-layer identification of RFID devices in product and document anti-counterfeiting solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22356","fieldValue":"RFID"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22356","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22356","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22357","fieldValue":"Plotkin, Gordon D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22357","fieldValue":" Layout randomization is a powerful, popular technique for software protection. We present it and study it in programming-language terms. More specifically, we consider layout randomization as part of an implementation for a high-level programming language; the implementation translates this language to a lower-level language in which memory addresses are numbers. We analyze this implementation, by relating low-level attacks against the implementation to contexts in the high-level programming language, and by establishing full abstraction results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22357","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22357","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22358","fieldValue":"Yavuz, Attila A"}
