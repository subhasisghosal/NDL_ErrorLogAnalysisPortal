Our main contribution lies in dealing with high-dimensionality minimization problems, which are often difficult to solve by all known minimization methods with or without gradient. In this article we take a special interest in the variables discretization issue. We also develop and implement several complementary stopping criteria. The original Metropolis iterative random search, which takes place in a Euclidean space Rn, is replaced by another similar exploration, performed within a succession of Euclidean spaces Rp, with p "}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18884","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18884","fieldValue":"ACM"}
