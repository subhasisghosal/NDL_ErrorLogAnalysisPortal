With more than 100,000 papers published each year just in computer science, performing a complete literature search becomes a Herculean task. Some of the existing approaches and tools for literature search cannot compete with the characteristics of todayâ\u20AC™s literature, and they suffer from ambiguity and homonymy. Techniques based on citation information are more robust to the mentioned issues. Thus, we recently built a Web service called the advisor, which provides personalized recommendations to researchers based on their papers of interest. Since most recommendation methods may return redundant results, diversifying the results of the search process is necessary to increase the amount of information that one can reach via an automated search. This article targets the problem of result diversification in citation-based bibliographic search, assuming that the citation graph itself is the only information available and no categories or intents are known. The contribution of this work is threefold. We survey various random walk--based diversification methods and enhance them with the direction awareness property to allow users to reach either old, foundational (possibly well-cited and well-known) research papers or recent (most likely less-known) ones. Next, we propose a set of novel algorithms based on vertex selection and query refinement. A set of experiments with various evaluation criteria shows that the proposed Î³-RLM algorithm performs better than the existing approaches and is suitable for real-time bibliographic search in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7571","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7571","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7572","fieldValue":" Recommender systems are in the center of network science, and they are becoming increasingly important in individual businesses for providing efficient, personalized services and products to users. Previous research in the field of recommendation systems focused on improving the precision of the system through designing more accurate recommendation lists. Recently, the community has been paying attention to diversity and novelty of recommendation lists as key characteristics of modern recommender systems. In many cases, novelty and precision do not go hand in hand, and the accuracy--novelty dilemma is one of the challenging problems in recommender systems, which needs efforts in making a trade-off between them. In this work, we propose an algorithm for providing novel and accurate recommendation to users. We consider the standard definition of accuracy and an effective self-information--based measure to assess novelty of the recommendation list. The proposed algorithm is based on item popularity, which is defined as the number of votes received in a certain time interval. Wavelet transform is used for analyzing popularity time series and forecasting their trend in future timesteps. We introduce two filtering algorithms based on the information extracted from analyzing popularity time series of the items. The popularity-based filtering algorithm gives a higher chance to items that are predicted to be popular in future timesteps. The other algorithm, denoted as a novelty and population-based filtering algorithm, is to move toward items with low popularity in past timesteps that are predicted to become popular in the future. The introduced filters can be applied as adds-on to any recommendation algorithm. In this article, we use the proposed algorithms to improve the performance of classic recommenders, including item-based collaborative filtering and Markov-based recommender systems. The experiments show that the algorithms could significantly improve both the accuracy and effective novelty of the classic recommenders."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7572","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7572","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7573","fieldValue":" Recent advances in mobile devices and their sensing capabilities have enabled the collection of rich contextual information and mobile device usage records through the device logs. These context-rich logs open a venue for mining the personal preferences of mobile users under varying contexts and thus enabling the development of personalized context-aware recommendation and other related services, such as mobile online advertising. In this article, we illustrate how to extract personal context-aware preferences from the context-rich device logs, or context logs for short, and exploit these identified preferences for building personalized context-aware recommender systems. A critical challenge along this line is that the context log of each individual user may not contain sufficient data for mining his or her context-aware preferences. Therefore, we propose to first learn common context-aware preferences from the context logs of many users. Then, the preference of each user can be represented as a distribution of these common context-aware preferences. Specifically, we develop two approaches for mining common context-aware preferences based on two different assumptions, namely, context-independent and context-dependent assumptions, which can fit into different application scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show that both approaches are effective and outperform baselines with respect to mining personal context-aware preferences for mobile users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7573","fieldValue":"ACM"}
