The goal is to reconstruct the scene while online identifying the objects from among a large collection of 3D shapes. Fine-grained shape identification demands a meticulous series of observations attending to varying views and parts of the object of interest. Inspired by the recent success of attention-based models for 2D recognition, we develop a 3D Attention Model that selects the best views to scan from, as well as the most informative regions in each view to focus on, to achieve efficient object recognition. The region-level attention leads to focus-driven features which are quite robust against object occlusion. The attention model, trained with the 3D shape collection, encodes the temporal dependencies among consecutive views with deep recurrent networks. This facilitates order-aware view planning accounting for robot movement cost. In achieving instance identification, the shape collection is organized into a hierarchy, associated with pre-trained hierarchical classifiers. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on an autonomous robot (PR) that explores a scene and identifies the objects to construct a 3D scene model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17735","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17735","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17736","fieldValue":" Demand for high-volume 3D scanning of real objects is rapidly growing in a wide range of applications, including online retailing, quality-control for manufacturing, stop motion capture for 3D animation, and archaeological documentation and reconstruction. Although mature technologies exist for high-fidelity 3D model acquisition, deploying them at scale continues to require non-trivial manual labor. We describe a system that allows non-expert users to scan large numbers of physical objects within a reasonable amount of time, and with greater ease. Our system uses novel view- and path-planning algorithms to control a structured-light scanner mounted on a calibrated motorized positioning system. We demonstrate the ability of our prototype to safely, robustly, and automatically acquire 3D models for large collections of small objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17737","fieldValue":"Lau, Rynson W H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17737","fieldValue":" We present a novel approach that allows web designers to easily direct user attention via visual flow on web designs. By collecting and analyzing users' eye gaze data on real-world webpages under the task-driven condition, we build two user attention models that characterize user attention patterns between a pair of page components. These models enable a novel web design interaction for designers to easily create a visual flow to guide users' eyes (i.e., direct user attention along a given path) through a web design with minimal effort. In particular, given an existing web design as well as a designer-specified path over a subset of page components, our approach automatically optimizes the web design so that the resulting design can direct users' attention to move along the input path. We have tested our approach on various web designs of different categories. Results show that our approach can effectively guide user attention through the web design according to the designer's high-level specification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17737","fieldValue":"ACM"}
