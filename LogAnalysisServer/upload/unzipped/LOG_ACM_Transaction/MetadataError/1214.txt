We call this approach dissociation and give an exact characterization of optimal oblivious bounds, that is, when the new probabilities are chosen independently of the probabilities of all other variables. Our motivation comes from the weighted model counting problem (or, equivalently, the problem of computing the probability of a Boolean function), which is &num;P-hard in general. By performing several dissociations, one can transform a Boolean formula whose probability is difficult to compute into one whose probability is easy to compute, and which is guaranteed to provide an upper or lower bound on the probability of the original formula by choosing appropriate probabilities for the dissociated variables. Our new bounds shed light on the connection between previous relaxation-based and model-based approximations and unify them as concrete choices in a larger design space. We also show how our theory allows a standard relational database management system (DBMS) to both upper and lower bound hard probabilistic queries in guaranteed polynomial time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14617","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14617","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14618","fieldValue":" Order-preserving submatrices (OPSMs) capture consensus trends over columns shared by rows in a data matrix. Mining OPSM patterns discovers important and interesting local correlations in many real applications, such as those involving biological data or sensor data. The prevalence of uncertain data in various applications, however, poses new challenges for OPSM mining, since data uncertainty must be incorporated into OPSM modeling and the algorithmic aspects. In this article, we define new probabilistic matrix representations to model uncertain data with continuous distributions. A novel probabilistic order-preserving submatrix (POPSM) model is formalized in order to capture similar local correlations in probabilistic matrices. The POPSM model adopts a new probabilistic support measure that evaluates the extent to which a row belongs to a POPSM pattern. Due to the intrinsic high computational complexity of the POPSM mining problem, we utilize the anti-monotonic property of the probabilistic support measure and propose an efficient Apriori-based mining framework called ProbApri to mine POPSM patterns. The framework consists of two mining methods, UniApri and NormApri, which are developed for mining POPSM patterns, respectively, from two representative types of probabilistic matrices, the UniDist matrix (assuming uniform data distributions) and the NormDist matrix (assuming normal data distributions). We show that the NormApri method is practical enough for mining POPSM patterns from probabilistic matrices that model more general data distributions. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach by two applications. First, we use two biological datasets to illustrate that the POPSM model better captures the characteristics of the expression levels of biologically correlated genes and greatly promotes the discovery of patterns with high biological significance. Our result is significantly better than the counterpart OPSMRM (OPSM with repeated measurement) model which adopts a set-valued matrix representation to capture data uncertainty. Second, we run the experiments on an RFID trace dataset and show that our POPSM model is effective and efficient in capturing the common visiting subroutes among users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14619","fieldValue":" String similarity join that finds similar string pairs between two string sets is an essential operation in many applications and has attracted significant attention recently in the database community. A significant challenge in similarity join is to implement an effective fuzzy match operation to find all similar string pairs which may not match exactly. In this article, we propose a new similarity function, called fuzzy-token-matching-based similarity which extends token-based similarity functions (e.g., jaccard similarity and cosine similarity) by allowing fuzzy match between two tokens. We study the problem of similarity join using this new similarity function and present a signature-based method to address this problem. We propose new signature schemes and develop effective pruning techniques to improve the performance. We also extend our techniques to support weighted tokens. Experimental results show that our method achieves high efficiency and result quality and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14619","fieldValue":"ACM"}
