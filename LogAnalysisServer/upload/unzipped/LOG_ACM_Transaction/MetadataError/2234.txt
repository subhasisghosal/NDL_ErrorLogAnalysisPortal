Creating seamless loops usually involves maximizing spatiotemporal consistency and applying Poisson blending. We take an end-to-end view of the problem and present new techniques that jointly improve loop quality while also significantly reducing processing time. A key idea is to relax the consistency constraints to anticipate the subsequent blending, thereby enabling looping of low-frequency content like moving clouds and changing illumination. We also analyze the input video to remove an undesired bias toward short loops. The quality gains are demonstrated visually and confirmed quantitatively using a new gradient-domain consistency metric. We improve system performance by classifying potentially loopable pixels, masking the 2D graph cut, pruning graph-cut labels based on dominant periods, and optimizing on a coarse grid while retaining finer detail. Together these techniques reduce computation times from tens of minutes to nearly real-time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17434","fieldValue":" Real-time high quality video tone mapping is needed for many applications, such as digital viewfinders in cameras, display algorithms which adapt to ambient light, in-camera processing, rendering engines for video games and video post-processing. We propose a viable solution for these applications by designing a video tone-mapping operator that controls the visibility of the noise, adapts to display and viewing environment, minimizes contrast distortions, preserves or enhances image details, and can be run in real-time on an incoming sequence without any preprocessing. To our knowledge, no existing solution offers all these features. Our novel contributions are: a fast procedure for computing local display-adaptive tone-curves which minimize contrast distortions, a fast method for detail enhancement free from ringing artifacts, and an integrated video tone-mapping solution combining all the above features."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17435","fieldValue":"Jeong, SoHyeon"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17435","fieldValue":" Traditional fluid simulations require large computational resources even for an average sized scene with the main bottleneck being a very small time step size, required to guarantee the stability of the solution. Despite a large progress in parallel computing and efficient algorithms for pressure computation in the recent years, realtime fluid simulations have been possible only under very restricted conditions. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning based approach, that formulates physics-based fluid simulation as a regression problem, estimating the acceleration of every particle for each frame. We designed a feature vector, directly modelling individual forces and constraints from the Navier-Stokes equations, giving the method strong generalization properties to reliably predict positions and velocities of particles in a large time step setting on yet unseen test videos. We used a regression forest to approximate the behaviour of particles observed in the large training set of simulations obtained using a traditional solver. Our GPU implementation led to a speed-up of one to three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art position-based fluid solver and runs in real-time for systems with up to 2 million particles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17435","fieldValue":"ACM"}
