However, this measure is computationally intensive or even prohibitive when it is applied to gene expression data. In this study, a recursive approach to Mahalanobis measure evaluation is proposed, with the goal of reducing computational overhead. Instead of evaluating Mahalanobis measure directly in high-dimensional space, the recursive approach evaluates the measure through successive evaluations in 2D space. Because of its recursive nature, this approach is extremely efficient when it is combined with a forward search procedure. In addition, it is noted that gene subsets selected by Mahalanobis measure tend to overfit training data and generalize unsatisfactorily on unseen test data, due to small sample size in gene expression problems. To alleviate the overfitting problem, a regularized recursive Mahalanobis measure is proposed in this study, and guidelines on determination of regularization parameters are provided. Experimental studies on five gene expression problems show that the regularized recursive Mahalanobis measure substantially outperforms the nonregularized Mahalanobis measures and the benchmark recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm in all five problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4561","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1353","fieldValue":" Distributed data stream processing applications are structured as graphs of interconnected modules able to ingest high-speed data and to transform them in order to generate results of interest. Elasticity is one of the most appealing features of stream processing applications. It makes it possible to scale up\/down the allocated computing resources on demand in response to fluctuations of the workload. On clouds, this represents a necessary feature to keep the operating cost at affordable levels while accommodating user-defined QoS requirements. In this article, we study this problem from a game-theoretic perspective. The control logic driving elasticity is distributed among local control agents capable of choosing the right amount of resources to use by each module. In a first step, we model the problem as a noncooperative game in which agents pursue their self-interest. We identify the Nash equilibria and we design a distributed procedure to reach the best equilibrium in the Pareto sense. As a second step, we extend the noncooperative formulation with a decentralized incentive-based mechanism in order to promote cooperation by moving the agreement point closer to the system optimum. Simulations confirm the results of our theoretical analysis and the quality of our strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1353","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1353","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4562","fieldValue":"Luk, Kai-Yiu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4562","fieldValue":" Constructing accurate computational models that explain how ions permeate through a biological ion channel is an important problem in biophysics and drug design. Brownian dynamics simulations are large-scale interacting particle computer simulations for modeling ion channel permeation but can be computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we show the somewhat surprising result that a small-dimensional semi-Markov model can generate events (such as conduction events and dwell times at binding sites in the protein) that are statistically indistinguishable from Brownian dynamics computer simulation. This approach enables the use of extrapolation techniques to predict channel conduction when performing the actual Brownian dynamics simulation that is computationally intractable. Numerical studies on the simulation of gramicidin A ion channels are presented."}
