In particular, we develop an algorithm called TensorTextures that learns a parsimonious model of the bidirectional texture function (BTF) from observational data. Given an ensemble of images of a textured surface, our nonlinear, generative model explicitly represents the multifactor interaction implicit in the detailed appearance of the surface under varying photometric angles, including local (per-texel) reflectance, complex mesostructural self-occlusion, interreflection and self-shadowing, and other BTF-relevant phenomena. Mathematically, TensorTextures is based on multilinear algebra, the algebra of higher-order tensors, hence its name. It is computed through a decomposition known as the N-mode SVD, an extension to tensors of the conventional matrix singular value decomposition (SVD). We demonstrate the application of TensorTextures to the image-based rendering of natural and synthetic textured surfaces under continuously varying viewpoint and illumination conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15406","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15406","fieldValue":" We propose a texture function for realistic modeling and efficient rendering of materials that exhibit surface mesostructures, translucency and volumetric texture variations. The appearance of such complex materials for dynamic lighting and viewing directions is expensive to calculate and requires an impractical amount of storage to precompute. To handle this problem, our method models an object as a shell layer, formed by texture synthesis of a volumetric material sample, and a homogeneous inner core. To facilitate computation of surface radiance from the shell layer, we introduce the shell texture function (STF) which describes voxel irradiance fields based on precomputed fine-level light interactions such as shadowing by surface mesostructures and scattering of photons inside the object. Together with a diffusion approximation of homogeneous inner core radiance, the STF leads to fast and detailed raytraced renderings of complex materials."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15406","fieldValue":"BTF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15406","fieldValue":"ACM"}
