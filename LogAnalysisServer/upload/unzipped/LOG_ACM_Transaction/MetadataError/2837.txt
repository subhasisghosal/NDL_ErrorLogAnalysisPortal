Since the problem is non-self-adjoint, the computation of transmission eigenvalues needs special treatment. Based on a fourth-order reformulation of the transmission eigenvalue problem, a mixed finite element method is applied. The method has two major advantages: 1) the formulation leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem naturally without the need to invert a related linear system, and 2) the nonphysical zero transmission eigenvalue, which has an infinitely dimensional eigenspace, is eliminated. To solve the resulting non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem, an iterative algorithm using restarted Arnoldi method is proposed. To make the computation efficient, the search interval is decided using a Faber-Krahn type inequality for transmission eignevalues and the interval is updated at each iteration. The algorithm is implemented using Matlab. The code can be easily used in the qualitative methods in inverse scattering and modified to compute transmission eigenvalues for other models such as elasticity problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19333","fieldValue":" Computing the Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric matrix is a problem that arises in various fields of physics. Both computing the Pfaffian and a related problem, computing the canonical form of a skew-symmetric matrix under unitary congruence, can be solved easily once the skew-symmetric matrix has been reduced to skew-symmetric tridiagonal form. We develop efficient numerical methods for computing this tridiagonal form based on Gaussian elimination, using a skew-symmetric, blocked form of the Parlett-Reid algorithm, or based on unitary transformations, using block Householder transformations and Givens rotations, that are applicable to dense and banded matrices, respectively. We also give a complete and fully optimized implementation of these algorithms in Fortran (including a C interface), and also provide Python, Matlab and Mathematica implementations for convenience. Finally, we apply these methods to compute the topological charge of a class D nanowire, and show numerically the equivalence of definitions based on the Hamiltonian and the scattering matrix."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19333","fieldValue":"Algorithm 923: Efficient Numerical Computation of the Pfaffian for Dense and Banded Skew-Symmetric Matrices"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19333","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19333","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19334","fieldValue":"Notz, Patrick K"}
