{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16309","fieldValue":" We introduce the Symmetry Factored Embedding (SFE) and the Symmetry Factored Distance (SFD) as new tools to analyze and represent symmetries in a point set. The SFE provides new coordinates in which symmetry is \"factored out,\" and the SFD is the Euclidean distance in that space. These constructions characterize the space of symmetric correspondences between points -- i.e., orbits. A key observation is that a set of points in the same orbit appears as a clique in a correspondence graph induced by pairwise similarities. As a result, the problem of finding approximate and partial symmetries in a point set reduces to the problem of measuring connectedness in the correspondence graph, a well-studied problem for which spectral methods provide a robust solution. We provide methods for computing the SFE and SFD for extrinsic global symmetries and then extend them to consider partial extrinsic and intrinsic cases. During experiments with difficult examples, we find that the proposed methods can characterize symmetries in inputs with noise, missing data, non-rigid deformations, and complex symmetries, without a priori knowledge of the symmetry group. As such, we believe that it provides a useful tool for automatic shape analysis in applications such as segmentation and stationary point detection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16310","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16310","fieldValue":" In this paper, we address the problem of inverse procedural modeling: Given a piece of exemplar 3D geometry, we would like to find a set of rules that describe objects that are similar to the exemplar. We consider local similarity, i.e., each local neighborhood of the newly created object must match some local neighborhood of the exemplar. We show that we can find explicit shape modification rules that guarantee strict local similarity by looking at the structure of the partial symmetries of the object. By cutting the object into pieces along curves within symmetric areas, we can build shape operations that maintain local similarity by construction. We systematically collect such editing operations and analyze their dependency to build a shape grammar. We discuss how to extract general rewriting systems, context free hierarchical rules, and grid-based rules. All of this information is derived directly from the model, without user interaction. The extracted rules are then used to implement tools for semi-automatic shape modeling by example, which are demonstrated on a number of different example data sets. Overall, our paper provides a concise theoretical and practical framework for inverse procedural modeling of 3D objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16310","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16310","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16311","fieldValue":" Yarn-based cloth simulation can improve visual quality but at high computational costs due to the reliance on numerous persistent yarn-yarn contacts to generate material behavior. Finding so many contacts in densely interlinked geometry is a pathological case for traditional collision detection, and the sheer number of contact interactions makes contact processing the simulation bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a method for approximating penalty-based contact forces in yarn-yarn collisions by computing the exact contact response at one time step, then using a rotated linear force model to approximate forces in nearby deformed configurations. Because contacts internal to the cloth exhibit good temporal coherence, sufficient accuracy can be obtained with infrequent updates to the approximation, which are done adaptively in space and time. Furthermore, by tracking contact models we reduce the time to detect new contacts. The end result is a 7- to 9-fold speedup in contact processing and a 4- to 5-fold overall speedup, enabling simulation of character-scale garments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16311","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16311","fieldValue":"ACM"}
