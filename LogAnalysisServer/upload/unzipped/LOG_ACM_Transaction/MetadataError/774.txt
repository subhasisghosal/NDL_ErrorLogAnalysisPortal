{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2268","fieldValue":" We consider requests for capacity in a given tree network T &equals; (V, E) where each edge e of the tree has some integer capacity $u_e. Each request f is a node pair with an integer demand df and a profit wf which is obtained if the request is satisfied. The objective is to find a set of demands that can be feasibly routed in the tree and which provides a maximum profit. This generalizes well-known problems, including the knapsack and b-matching problems. When all demands are 1, we have the integer multicommodity flow problem. Garg et al. [1997] had shown that this problem is NP-hard and gave a 2-approximation algorithm for the cardinality case (all profits are 1) via a primal-dual algorithm. Our main result establishes that the integrality gap of the natural linear programming relaxation is at most 4 for the case of arbitrary profits. Our proof is based on coloring paths on trees and this has other applications for wavelength assignment in optical network routing. We then consider the problem with arbitrary demands. When the maximum demand dmax is at most the minimum edge capacity umin$, we show that the integrality gap of the LP is at most 48. This result is obtained by showing that the integrality gap for the demand version of such a problem is at most 11.542 times that for the unit-demand case. We use techniques of Kolliopoulos and Stein [2004, 2001] to obtain this. We also obtain, via this method, improved algorithms for line and ring networks. Applications and connections to other combinatorial problems are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2268","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2268","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13306","fieldValue":" In order to achieve satisfactory verification for complicated low-power demands in green products, we propose a verification work reduction methodology. It consists of three step, namely virtual, direct actual, and actual model simulations. Virtual low-power simulation inserts low-power cells, such as isolators or level shifters, virtually and simulates logical behavior for design under test (DUT) based on user-defined power mode. Direct actual low-power simulation replaces behavior models without non-logical pins for some of modules with actual models with non-logical pins, which are Vdd and Gnd, and simulates DUT in mixed level. Actual low-power simulation simulates DUT by using actual models with non-logical pins for all cells and hard macros. We introduce techniques which classify the type of the bugs on which we focus at each verification step and prevent the concerned bugs from leaking to the latter verification step as much as possible. We applied our methodology to an actual chip and could reduce the total simulation period until tape-out by 38.8&percnt; and the total chip development period by 10&percnt;, compared with the conventional methodology."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13307","fieldValue":"Lee, Ju-Yueh"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13307","fieldValue":" Reliability has become an increasingly important concern for SRAM-based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Targeting SEU (single event upset) in SRAM-based FPGAs, this article first develops an SEU evaluation framework that can quantify the failure sensitivity for each configuration bit during design time. This framework considers detailed fault behavior and logic masking on a post-layout FPGA application and performs logic simulation on various circuit elements for fault evaluation. Applying this framework on MCNC benchmark circuits, we first characterize SEUs with respect to different FPGA circuits and architectures, for example, bidirectional routing and unidirectional routing. We show that in both routing architectures, interconnects not only contribute to the lion's share of the SEU-induced functional failures, but also present higher failure rates per configuration bits than LUTs. Particularly, local interconnect multiplexers in logic blocks have the highest failure rate per configuration bit. Then, we evaluate three recently proposed SEU mitigation algorithms, IPD, IPF, and IPV, which are all logic resynthesis-based with little or no overhead on placement and routing. Different fault mitigating capabilities at the chip level are revealed, and it demonstrates that algorithms with explicit consideration for interconnect significantly mitigate the SEU at the chip level, for example, IPV achieves 61&percnt; failure rate reduction on average against IPF with about 15&percnt;. In addition, the combination of the three algorithms delivers over 70&percnt; failure rate reduction on average at the chip level. The experiments also reveal that in order to improve fault tolerance at the chip level, it is necessary for future fault mitigation algorithms to concern not only LUT or interconnect faults, but also their interactions. We envision that our framework can be used to cast more useful insights for more robust FPGA circuits, architectures, and better synthesis algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13307","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13307","fieldValue":"SER"}
