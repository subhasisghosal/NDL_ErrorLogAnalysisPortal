{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25696","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a novel approach to segment discriminative patches in human activity videos. First, we adopt the spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs) to represent significant motion patterns in the video sequence. Then, nonnegative sparse coding is exploited to generate a sparse representation of each STIP descriptor. We construct the feature vector for each video by applying a two-stage sum-pooling and $l_2$-normalization operation. After training a multi-class classifier through the error-correcting code SVM, the discriminative portion of each video is determined as the patch that has the highest confidence while also being correctly classified according to the video category. Experimental results show that the video patches extracted by our method are more separable, while preserving the perceptually relevant portion of each activity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3480","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3480","fieldValue":" Several approaches attempt to reproduce the appearance of a scotopic low-light night scene on a photopic display (â\u20ACœday-for-nightâ\u20AC?) by introducing color desaturation, loss of acuity, and the Purkinje shift toward blue colors. We argue that faithful stereo reproduction of night scenes on photopic stereo displays requires manipulation of not only color but also binocular disparity. To this end, we performed a psychophysics experiment to devise a model of disparity at scotopic luminance levels. Using this model, we can match binocular disparity of a scotopic stereo content displayed on a photopic monitor to the disparity that would be perceived if the scene was actually scotopic. The model allows for real-time computation of common stereo content as found in interactive applications such as simulators or computer games."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3480","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3480","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25697","fieldValue":" Zoomable video streaming refers to a new class of interactive video applications, where users can zoom into a video stream to view a selected region of interest in higher resolutions and pan around to move the region of interest. The zoom and pan effects are typically achieved by breaking the source video into a grid of independently decodable tiles. Streaming the tiles to a set of heterogeneous users using broadcast is challenging, as users have different link rates and different regions of interest at different resolution levels. In this article, we consider the following problem: Given the subset of tiles that each user requested, the link rate of each user, and the available time slots, at which resolution should each tile be sent, to maximize the overall video quality received by all users. We design an efficient algorithm to solve this problem and evaluate the solution on a testbed using 10 mobile devices. Our method is able to achieve up to 12dB improvements over other heuristic methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25697","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25697","fieldValue":"ACM"}
