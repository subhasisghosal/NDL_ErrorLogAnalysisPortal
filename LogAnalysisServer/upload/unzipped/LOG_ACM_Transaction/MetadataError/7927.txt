To break down the complexity of resource allocation at the base station, a split approach has been proposed in the literature, where the tasks of scheduling packets and allocating them into frames are solved in separate and subsequent stages. In this paper, we focus on the allocation task alone, which is addressed in its full complexity, i.e., by considering that data within the frame must be allocated as bursts with rectangular shape, each consisting of a set of indivisible sub-bursts, and that a variable portion of the frame is reserved for in-band signaling. After proving that the resulting allocation problem is NP-hard, we develop an efficient heuristic algorithm, called Recursive Tiles and Stripes (RTS), to solve it. RTS, in addition to handling a more general problem, is shown to perform better than state-of-the-art solutions via numerical analysis with realistic system parametrization. Furthermore, an extensive evaluation of the interaction between the scheduler and the allocator is carried out in a wide variety of network scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10669","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10669","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10669","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1974","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1974","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10670","fieldValue":" A novel solution is proposed to undertake a frequent task in wireless networks, which is to let all nodes broadcast information to and receive information from their respective one-hop neighboring nodes. The contribution in this paper is twofold. First, as each neighbor selects one message-bearing codeword from its unique codebook for transmission, it is shown that decoding their messages based on a superposition of those codewords through the multiaccess channel is fundamentally a problem of compressed sensing. In the case where each message is designed to consist of a small number of bits, an iterative algorithm based on belief propagation is developed for efficient decoding. Second, to satisfy the half-duplex constraint, each codeword consists of randomly distributed on-slots and off-slots. A node transmits during its on-slots and listens to its neighbors only through its own off-slots. Over one frame interval, each node broadcasts a message to its neighbors and simultaneously receives the superposition of neighbors' signals through its own off-slots and then decodes all messages. The proposed solution fully exploits the multiaccess nature of the wireless medium and addresses the half-duplex constraint at the fundamental level. In a network consisting of Poisson distributed nodes, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme often achieves several times the rate of slotted ALOHA and CSMA with the same packet error rate."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10670","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
