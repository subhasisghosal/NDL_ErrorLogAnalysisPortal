Suggestions are made for how simulation analysis, considered in the explicit context of discrete-event simulation models, can create new opportunities for meaningful research and more efficient modeling. Modeling decisions can play a significant role in the performance of analytical procedures. How a simulation model is designed can enable, inhibit, or even invalidate analytical procedures and methodology research results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24991","fieldValue":"Hong, JEFF L."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24991","fieldValue":" Industrial Strength COMPASS (ISC) is a particular implementation of a general framework for optimizing the expected value of a performance measure of a stochastic simulation with respect to integer-ordered decision variables in a finite (but typically large) feasible region defined by linear-integer constraints. The framework consists of a global-search phase, followed by a local-search phase, and ending with a â\u20ACœclean-upâ\u20AC? (selection of the best) phase. Each phase provides a probability 1 convergence guarantee as the simulation effort increases without bound: Convergence to a globally optimal solution in the global-search phase; convergence to a locally optimal solution in the local-search phase; and convergence to the best of a small number of good solutions in the clean-up phase. In practice, ISC stops short of such convergence by applying an improvement-based transition rule from the global phase to the local phase; a statistical test of convergence from the local phase to the clean-up phase; and a ranking-and-selection procedure to terminate the clean-up phase. Small-sample validity of the statistical test and ranking-and-selection procedure is proven for normally distributed data. ISC is compared to the commercial optimization via simulation package OptQuest on five test problems that range from 2 to 20 decision variables and on the order of $10^4 to 1020$ feasible solutions. These test cases represent response-surface models with known properties and realistic system simulation problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24992","fieldValue":"Chen, Chun-Hung"}
