The main metric we want to capture is the average packet audio playout delay vs. the packet loss rate as perceived by users. Other metrics we take into account are the packet loss rate vs. the receiving buffer capacity, the lateness of discarded packets vs. average packet audio playout delay, and the waiting time in the receiver buffer for the played packets vs. the average packet audio playout delay. The study is conducted in the algebraic language EMPA, by way of formal descriptions of the three audio mechanisms. The mechanisms are analyzed via simulation using the software tool TwoTowers under various (experimentally obtained or randomly generated) traffic conditions. The stochastic process algebra EMPA is used because it compositionally supports system modeling, it allows functional properties of systems to be formally verified (unlike conventional simulatiors), and it represents generally distributed durations (which come into play in the three audio mechanisms). The comparison reveals that in general no one of the three mechanisms outperforms the other two, as their performance depends on the traffic conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24833","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24833","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3401","fieldValue":" Controlling computers using eye movements can provide a fast and efficient alternative to the computer mouse. However, implementing object selection in gaze-controlled systems is still a challenge. Dwell times or fixations on a certain object typically used to elicit the selection of this object show several disadvantages. We studied deviations of critical thresholds by an individual and task-specific adaptation method. This demonstrated an enormous variability of optimal dwell times. We developed an alternative approach using antisaccades for selection. For selection by antisaccades, highlighted objects are copied to one side of the object. The object is selected when fixating to the side opposed to that copy requiring to inhibit an automatic gaze shift toward new objects. Both techniques were compared in a selection task. Two experiments revealed superior performance in terms of errors for the individually adapted dwell times. Antisaccades provide an alternative approach to dwell time selection, but they did not show an improvement over dwell time. We discuss potential improvements in the antisaccade implementation with which antisaccades might become a serious alternative to dwell times for object selection in gaze-controlled systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3401","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3401","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24834","fieldValue":" We consider a switching system that has multiple ports that share a common buffer, in which there is a FIFO logical queue for each port. Each port may support a large number of flows or connections, which are approximately homogeneous in their statistical characteristics, with common QoS requirements in cell loss and maximum delay. Heterogeneity may exist across ports. Our first contribution is a buffer management scheme based on Buffer Admission Control, which is integrated with Connection Admission Control at the switch. At the same time, this scheme is fair, efficient, and robust in sharing the buffer resources across ports. Our scheme is based on the resource-sharing technique of Virtual Partitioning. Our second major contribution is to advance the practice of discrete-event fluid simulations. Such simulations are approximations to cell-level simulations and offer orders of magnitude speed-up. A third contribution of the paper is the formulation and solution of a problem of optimal allocation of bandwidth and buffers to each port having specific delay bounds, in a lossless multiplexing framework. Finally, we report on extensive simulation results. The scheme is found to be effective, efficient, and robust."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24834","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24834","fieldValue":"ACM"}
