{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1185","fieldValue":" This article presents a novel intelligent embedded agent approach for reducing the number of associations and interconnections between various agents operating within ad hoc multiagent societies of an Ambient Intelligent Environment (AIE) in order to reduce the processing latency and overheads. The main goal of the proposed fuzzy-based intelligent embedded agents (F-IAS) includes learning the overall network configuration and adapting to the system functionality to personalize themselves to the user needs based on monitoring the user in a lifelong nonintrusive mode. In addition, the F-IAS agents aim to reduce the agent interconnections to the most relevant set of agents in order to reduce the processing overheads and thus implicitly improving the system overall efficiency. We employ embedded ambassador agents, namely embassadors, which are designated F-IAS agents utilized with additional novel characteristics to not only act as a gateway filtering the number of messages multicast across societies but also discover, recommend, and establish associations between agents residing in separate societies. In order to validate the efficiency of the proposed methods for multiagent and society-based intelligent association discovery and learning of F-IAS agents\/embassadors we will present two sets of unique experiments. The first experiment describes the obtained results carried out within the intelligent Dormitory (iDorm) which is a real-world testbed for AIE research. Here we specifically demonstrate the utilization of the F-IAS agents and discuss that by optimizing the set of associations the agents increase efficiency and performance. The second set of experiments is based on emulating an iDorm-like large-scale multi-society-based AIE environment. The results illustrate how embassadors discover strongly correlated agent pairs and cause them to form associations so that relevant agents of separate societies can start interacting with each other."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1185","fieldValue":"A multi-society-based intelligent association discovery and selection for ambient intelligence environments"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1185","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1185","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2602","fieldValue":" In this article, we study revenue maximizing envy-free pricing in multi-item markets: There are m indivisible items with unit supply each and n potential buyers where each buyer is interested in acquiring one item. The goal is to determine allocations (a matching between buyers and items) and prices of all items to maximize total revenue given that all buyers are envy-free. We give a polynomial time algorithm to compute a revenue maximizing envy-free pricing when every buyer evaluates at most two items at a positive valuation, by reducing it to an instance of weighted independent set in a perfect graph and applying the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem. We complement our result by showing that the problem becomes NP-hard if some buyers are interested in at least three items."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2602","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2602","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16921","fieldValue":" We present a method to create high-quality sampling filters by combining a prescribed number of texels from several resolutions in a mipmap. Our technique provides fine control over the number of texels we read per texture sample so that we can scale quality to match a memory bandwidth budget. Our method also has a fixed cost regardless of the filter we approximate, which makes it feasible to approximate higher-quality filters such as a LÃ¡nczos 2 filter in real-time rendering. To find the best set of texels to represent a given sampling filter and what weights to assign those texels, we perform a cardinality-constrained least-squares optimization of the most likely candidate solutions and encode the results of the optimization in a small table that is easily stored on the GPU. We present results that show we accurately reproduce filters using few texel reads and that both quality and speed scale smoothly with available bandwidth. When using four or more texels per sample, our image quality exceeds that of trilinear interpolation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16921","fieldValue":"ACM"}
