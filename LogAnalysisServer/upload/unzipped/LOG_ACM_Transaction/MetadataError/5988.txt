However, research has not fully explored the adaptation of HIT systems, particularly the tensions between individual flexibility and organizational needs in the adaptation process. This study analyzes how Emergency Department (ED) clinicians adapted to a new hospital-wide Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system. We present four adaptation cases revealing two interrelated types of adaptationsâ\u20AC\u201Dtechnical and organizationalâ\u20AC\u201Das responses to the new system in use. First, individual clinicians respond to the immediate alteration in workflows caused by the EMR, while the organizational adaptations later mitigate the changes in healthcare quality control resulting from the cliniciansâ\u20AC™ initial adaptation. Our analysis reflects the critical nature and value of both adaptation types, with an emphasis on the triggers and process of organizational adaptation, for the successful implementation of a socio-technical-political system in a healthcare organization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5885","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5885","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5886","fieldValue":" Ageing has become a significant area of interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in recent years. In this article we provide a critical analysis of 30 years of ageing research published across the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) community. Discourse analysis of the content of 644 archival papers highlights how ageing is typically framed as a â\u20ACœproblemâ\u20AC? that can be managed by technology. We highlight how ageing is typically defined through an emphasis on the economic and societal impact of health and care needs of older people, concerns around socialisation as people age, and declines in abilities and associated reductions in performance when using technology. We draw from research within the fields of social and critical gerontology to highlight how these discourses in SIGCHI literature represent common stereotypes around old age that have also prevailed in the wider literature in gerontology. We conclude by proposing strategies for future research at the intersection of ageing and HCI."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5886","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5886","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5887","fieldValue":"Judge, Tejinder K"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5887","fieldValue":" Video chat systems such as Skype, Google&plus; Hangouts, and FaceTime have been widely adopted by family members and friends to connect with one another over distance. We have conducted a corpus of studies that explore how various demographics make use of such video chat systems in which this usage moves beyond the paradigm of conversational support to one in which aspects of everyday life are shared over long periods of time, sometimes in an almost passive manner. We describe and reflect on studies of long-distance couples, teenagers, and major life events, along with design research focused on new video communication systemsâ\u20AC\u201Dthe Family Window, Family Portals, and Perchâ\u20AC\u201Dthat explicitly support â\u20ACœalways-on videoâ\u20AC? for awareness and communication. Overall, our findings show that people highly value long-term video connections and have appropriated them in a number of different ways. Designers of future video communication systems need to consider: ways of supporting the sharing of everyday life rather than just conversation, providing different design solutions for different locations and situations, providing appropriate audio control and feedback, and supporting expressions of intimacy over distance."}
