For quality control purposes, it is important to have a uniform viewing experience across these various platforms. In this work, we focus on voice synchronization, an aspect of video quality that is strongly affected by current post-production and transmission practices. We examined the synchronization of an actor's voice and lip movements in two distinct scenarios. First, we simulated the temporal mismatch between the audio and video tracks that can occur during dubbing or during broadcast. Next, we recreated the pitch changes that result from conversions between formats with different frame rates. We show, for the first time, that these audio visual mismatches affect viewer enjoyment. When temporal synchronization is noticeably absent, there is a decrease in the perceived performance quality and the perceived emotional intensity of a performance. For pitch changes, we find that higher pitch voices are not preferred, especially for male actors. Based on our findings, we advise that mismatched audio and video signals negatively affect viewer experience."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24682","fieldValue":"Lin, Yi-Bing"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24682","fieldValue":" Recently there has been a great deal of interest in performance evalution of parallel simulation. Most work is devoted to the time complexity and assumes that the amount of memory available for parallel simulation is unlimited. This paper studies the space complexity of parallel simulation. Our goal is to design an efficient memory management protocol which guarantees that the memory consumption of parallel simulation is of the same order as sequential simulation. (Such an algorithm is referred to as a optimal.) First, we derive the relationships among the space complexities of sequential simulation, Chandy-Misra simulation [2], and Time Warp simulation [7]. We show that Chandy-Misra may consume more storage than sequential simulation, or vice versa. Then we show that Time Warp never consumes less memory than sequential simulation. Then we describe cancelback, an optimal Time Warp memory management protocol proposed by Jefferson. Although cancelback is considered to be complete solution for the storage management problem in Time Warp, some efficiency issues in implementing this algorithm must be considered. We propose an optimal algorithm called artifical rollback. We show that this algorithm is easy to implement and analyze. An implementation of artificial rollback is given, which is integrated with processor scheduling to adjust the memory consumption rate based on the amount of free storage available in the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24682","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24682","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24683","fieldValue":" We explore the suitability of the Chandy-Misra-Bryant (CMB) algorithm for the domain of digital logic simulation. Our evaluation is based on results for six realistic benchmark circuits, one of them being the R6000 microprocessor form MIPS. A quantitative evaluation of the concurrency exhibited by the CMB algorithm shows that an average of 42-196 element activations can be evaluated in parallel if arbitrarily many processors are available. One major factor limiting the parallel performance is the large number of deadlocks that occur. We present a classification of the types of deadlocks and describe them in terms of circuit structure. Using domain-specific knowledge, we propose and evaluate several methods for both reducing the number of deadlock occurences and for reducing the time spent on each occurence. Running on a 16-processor Encore Multimax we observe speedups of 6-9. While these self-relative speedups are larger than a parallel version of the traditional centralized-time event-driven algorithm, they come at the price of large overheads: significantly more complex element evaluations, extra element evaluations, and deadlock resolution time. These overheads overwhelm the advantages of using distributed time and consistently make the parallel performance of the CMB algorithm about three times slower than that of the traditional parallel event-driven algorithm. Our experience leads us to conclude that the distributed-time CMB algorithm does not present a viable alternative to the centralized-time event-driven algorithm in the domain of parallel digital logic simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24683","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24683","fieldValue":"ACM"}
