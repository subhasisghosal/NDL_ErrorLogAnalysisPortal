Coordinated supply voltage and body bias throttling enables the compiler to better optimize the total energy consumption of the system in future technology nodes. We present a compilation technique that targets realtime applications running on embedded processors with combined dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and adaptive body biasing (ABB) capabilities. Considering the delay and energy penalty of switching between operating modes of the processor, our compiler judiciously inserts mode-switch instructions in selected locations of the code and generates executable binary that is guaranteed to meet the deadline constraint. More importantly, our algorithm runs very fast and comes reasonably close to the theoretical limit of energy optimization using DVS&plus;ABB. At 65nm technology, we improve the energy dissipation of the generated code by an average of 33.20&percnt; under deadline constraints. While our technique's improvement in energy dissipation over conventional DVS is marginal (6.91&percnt;) at 130nm, the average improvement continues to grow to 13.19&percnt;, 22.97&percnt;, and 33.21&percnt; for 90nm, 65nm, and 45nm technology nodes, respectively. Compared to a recent ILP-based competitor, we improve the runtime by more than three orders of magnitude, while producing improved results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13011","fieldValue":" This article develops circuit-simulated routing algorithms. We model the routing graph by an RC network with terminals as inputs, and show that the faster an output reaches its peak, the higher the possibility for the corresponding Hanan or escape node to become a Steiner point. This enables us to select Steiner points and then apply any minimum spanning tree algorithm to obtain obstacle-free or obstacle-aware Steiner routing. Compared with existing algorithms, our algorithms have significant gain on either wirelength or runtime for obstacle-free routing, and on both wirelength and runtime for obstacle-aware routing."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13011","fieldValue":"OARSMT"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13011","fieldValue":"RSMT"}
