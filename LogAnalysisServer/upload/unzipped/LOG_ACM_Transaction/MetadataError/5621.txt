In contrast to other experimental techniques, cryo-electron microscopy is capable of visualizing large molecular complexes such as viruses and ribosomes. At medium resolution, the positions of the atoms are not visible and the process cannot proceed. The medium-resolution images produced by cryo-electron microscopy are used to derive the atomic structure of the proteins in de novo modeling. The skeletons of the 3D gray-scale images are used to interpret important information that is helpful in de novo modeling. Unfortunately, not all features of the image can be captured using a single segmentation. In this paper, we present a segmentation-free approach to extract the gray-scale curve-like skeletons. The approach relies on a novel representation of the 3D image, where the image is modeled as a graph and a set of volume trees. A test containing 36 synthesized maps and one authentic map shows that our approach can improve the performance of the two tested tools used in de novo modeling. The improvements were 62 and 13 percent for Gorgon and DP-TOSS, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4967","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4967","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4967","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4968","fieldValue":"Chuang, Li-Yeh"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4968","fieldValue":"Yang, Cheng-Huei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4968","fieldValue":"Tsai, Jui-Hung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4968","fieldValue":"Yang, Cheng-Hong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4968","fieldValue":" Operons contain valuable information for drug design and determining protein functions. Genes within an operon are co-transcribed to a single-strand mRNA and must be coregulated. The identification of operons is, thus, critical for a detailed understanding of the gene regulations. However, currently used experimental methods for operon detection are generally difficult to implement and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a chaotic binary particle swarm optimization (CBPSO) to predict operons in bacterial genomes. The intergenic distance, participation in the same metabolic pathway and the cluster of orthologous groups (COG) properties of the Escherichia coli genome are used to design a fitness function. Furthermore, the Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are tested and evaluated for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The computational results indicate that the proposed method works effectively in terms of enhancing the performance of the operon prediction. The proposed method also achieved a good balance between sensitivity and specificity when compared to methods from the literature."}
