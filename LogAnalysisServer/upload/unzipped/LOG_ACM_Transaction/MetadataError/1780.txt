When applied to complex geometries, our formulation results in dramatically simpler systems of equations than those of traditional mesh contact models. Contact between highly detailed meshes can be simplified to a single unilateral constraint equation, or accurately processed at arbitrary geometry-independent resolution with simultaneous sticking and sliding across contact patches. We exploit fast GPU methods for computing layered depth images, which provides us with the intersection volumes and gradients necessary to formulate the contact equations as linear complementarity problems. Straightforward and popular numerical methods, such as projected Gauss-Seidel, can be used to solve the system. We demonstrate our method in a number of scenarios and present results involving both rigid and deformable objects at interactive rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16288","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16288","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2544","fieldValue":" We study two closely related problems in nonpreemptive scheduling of jobs on identical parallel machines. In these two settings there are either fixed jobs or nonavailability intervals during which the machines are not available; in both cases, the objective is to minimize the makespan. Both formulations have different applications, for example, in turnaround scheduling or overlay computing. For both problems we contribute approximation algorithms with an improved ratio of 3\/2. For scheduling with fixed jobs, a lower bound of 3\/2 on the approximation ratio has been obtained by Scharbrodt et al. [1999]; for scheduling with nonavailability we provide the same lower bound. We use dual approximation, creation of a gap structure, and a PTAS for the multiple subset sum problem, combined with a postprocessing step to assign large jobs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2544","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2544","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16289","fieldValue":"Cheng, Ming-Ming"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16289","fieldValue":"Zhang, Fang-Lue"}
