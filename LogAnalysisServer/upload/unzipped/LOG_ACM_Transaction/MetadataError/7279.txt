We focus on the downlink of the system. Each mobile has a utility function that characterizes its degree of satisfaction for the received service. The objective is to obtain a power allocation that maximizes the total system utility. Typically, natural utility functions for each mobile are nonconcave. Hence, we cannot use existing convex optimization techniques to derive a global optimal solution. We develop a simple (distributed) algorithm to obtain a power allocation that is asymptotically optimal in the number of mobiles. The algorithm is based on dynamic pricing and consists of two stages. At the mobile selection stage, the base station selects mobiles to which power is allocated. At the power allocation stage, the base station allocates power to the selected mobiles. We provide numerical results that illustrate the performance of our scheme. In particular, we show that our algorithm results in system performance that is close to the performance of a global optimal solution in most cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9374","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9375","fieldValue":" This paper considers the problem of determining the achievable rates in multi-hop wireless mesh networks with orthogonal channels. We classify wireless networks with orthogonal channels into two types, half duplex and full duplex, and consider the problem of jointly routing the flows and scheduling transmissions to achieve a given rate vector. We develop tight necessary and sufficient conditions for the achievability of the rate vector. We develop efficient and easy to implement Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes for solving the routing problem. The scheduling problem is a solved as a graph edge-coloring problem. We show that this approach guarantees that the solution obtained is within 50% of the optimal solution in the worst case (within 67% of the optimal solution in a common special case) and, in practice, is close to 90% of the optimal solution on the average. The approach that we use is quite flexible and can be extended to handle more sophisticated interference conditions, and routing with diversity requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9375","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9376","fieldValue":" WDM networks adapt to the changes in traffic by reconfiguring the virtual topology. Though reconfiguration is done with the objective of utilizing resources efficiently, the resulting disruption in traffic is a cause for concern. Hence, policies are formed to decide on the time (i.e., when) to trigger reconfiguration and the new virtual topology that is most beneficial to the network. We present a simple, general and flexible framework, based on the two conflicting objectives of efficient resource utilization and minimizing traffic disruption, to evaluate reconfiguration policies. Instead of re-determining the reconfiguration policy whenever the traffic changes, we present Incremental Clustering Algorithm (ICA) to pre-plan the reconfiguration policy for a fully predictable finite sequence of traffic matrices. Since full predictability of such a sequence is not possible in practice, we learn the traffic sequences in order to probabilistically predict the future ones. From an information theoretic point of view, we quantify the predictability of traffic sequences and the number of times the reconfiguration policy is re-determined for any WDM network. To optimally predict the future traffic sequences and to incur optimal cost in the re-determination of the reconfiguration policy, we propose Universal Reconfiguration Management System (URMS). A Prediction-based Incremental Clustering Algorithm (PICA) that extends ICA is used by URMS to predict the reconfiguration policy. Within URMS, the probabilities are assigned to the traffic sequences by the prediction schemes of LZ78. We performed extensive simulations to study the effectiveness and efficiency of URMS when compared to the fully predictable and totally unpredictable models. The performance of URMS improves with learning and nearly achieves the performance of a fully predictable model."}
