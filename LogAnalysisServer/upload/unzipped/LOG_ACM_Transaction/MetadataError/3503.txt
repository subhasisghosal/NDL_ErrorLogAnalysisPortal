In particular, we are interested in asymmetric power assignments so that the induced communication graph holds good distance and energy stretch factors simultaneously. In addition, we consider the following optimization objectives: low total energy consumption, low interference level, low hopdiameter, and high network lifetime. Two node deployment scenarios are studied: random and deterministic. For n random nodes distributed uniformly and independently in a unit square, we present several power assignments with varying construction-time complexities. The results are based on various geometric properties of random points and shortest path tree constructions. Due to the probabilistic nature of this scenario, the probability of our results converges to one as the number of network nodes, n, increases. For the deterministic case, we present two power assignments with nontrivial bounds. These are established in addition to shortcut edges that satisfy desired threshold stretch. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results for spanner construction in wireless ad-hoc networks with provable bounds for both energy and distance metrics simultaneously. Our power assignments, in addition, try optimizing additional network properties, such as network lifetime, interference, and hop diameter."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21434","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks are typically deployed in harsh environments, thus post-deployment failures are not infrequent. An execution trace containing events in their order of execution could play a crucial role in postmortem diagnosis of these failures. Obtaining such a trace however is challenging due to stringent resource constraints. We propose an efficient approach to intraprocedural and interprocedural control-flow tracing that generates traces of all interleaving concurrent events and of the control-flow paths taken inside those events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with the help of case studies and illustrate its low overhead through measurements and simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21435","fieldValue":" Modeling and evaluating the performance of large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a challenging problem. The traditional method for representing the global state of a system as a cross product of the states of individual nodes in the system results in a state space whose size is exponential in the number of nodes. We propose an alternative way of representing the global state of a system: namely, as a probability mass function (pmf) which represents the fraction of nodes in different states. A pmf corresponds to a point in a Euclidean space of possible pmf values, and the evolution of the state of a system is represented by trajectories in this Euclidean space. We propose a novel performance evaluation method that examines all pmf trajectories in a dense Euclidean space by exploring only finite relevant portions of the space. We call our method Euclidean model checking. Euclidean model checking is useful both in the design phaseâ\u20AC\u201Dwhere it can help determine system parameters based on a specificationâ\u20AC\u201Dand in the evaluation phaseâ\u20AC\u201Dwhere it can help verify performance properties of a system. We illustrate the utility of Euclidean model checking by using it to design a time difference of arrival (TDoA) distance measurement protocol and to evaluate the protocol's implementation on a 90-node WSN. To facilitate such performance evaluations, we provide a Markov model estimation method based on applying a standard statistical estimation technique to samples resulting from the execution of a system."}
