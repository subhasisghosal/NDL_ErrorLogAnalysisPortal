However, while the communication in a WAN may be affected by the unpredictable behavior of the network, with messages that can be dropped or delayed, existing publish\/subscribe solutions pay just a little attention to addressing these issues. On the contrary, applications such as business intelligence, critical infrastructures, and financial services require delivery guarantees with strict temporal deadlines. In this paper, we propose a framework that enforces both reliability and timeliness for publish\/subscribe services over WAN. Specifically, we combine two different approaches: gossiping, to retrieve missing packets in case of incomplete information, and network coding, to reduce the number of retransmissions and, consequently, the latency. We provide an analytical model that describes the information recovery capabilities of our algorithm and a simulation-based study, taking into account a real workload from the Air Traffic Control domain, which evidences how the proposed solution is able to ensure reliable event notification over a WAN within a reasonable bounded time window."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10567","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10567","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10567","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10568","fieldValue":" Swarm-based peer-to-peer streaming (SPS) mechanisms tend to generate a significant amount of costly inter-ISP traffic. Localization of overlay connectivity reduces inter-ISP traffic. However, it can adversely affect the delivered quality. In this paper, we systematically examine the performance of SPS for live video over localized overlays. We identify and discuss the fundamental bottlenecks limiting the stream quality and present OLIVES, an ISP-friendly P2P streaming mechanism for live video. OLIVES maintains a fully localized overlay to reduce the volume of inter-ISP traffic and incorporates a two-tier inter-ISP and intra-ISP scheduling scheme to maximize the delivered quality to individual peers. One important design choice is to perform basic scheduling at a substream level and to use implicit coordination among peers. This allows OLIVES to efficiently detect missing blocks and pull them into the ISP in a timely manner with a minimum in coordination overhead. Furthermore, OLIVES incorporates a shortcutting technique that limits the buffer requirements for each participating peer and effectively reduced the playout latency. Through analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate the ability of OLIVES to deliver high-quality streams over localized overlays in various realistic scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10568","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10568","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10568","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10569","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of scheduling in a single-hop switched network with a mix of heavy-tailed and light-tailed traffic and analyze the impact of heavy-tailed traffic on the performance of Max-Weight scheduling. As a performance metric, we use the delay stability of traffic flows: A traffic flow is delay-stable if its expected steady-state delay is finite, and delay-unstable otherwise. First, we show that a heavy-tailed traffic flow is delay-unstable under any scheduling policy. Then, we focus on the celebrated Max-Weight scheduling policy and show that a light-tailed flow that conflicts with a heavy-tailed flow is also delay-unstable. This is true irrespective of the rate or the tail distribution of the light-tailed flow or other scheduling constraints in the network. Surprisingly, we show that a light-tailed flow can become delay-unstable, even when it does not conflict with heavy-tailed traffic. Delay stability in this case may depend on the rate of the light-tailed flow. Finally, we turn our attention to the class of Max-Weight- $\\alpha$ scheduling policies. We show that if the $\\alpha$ -parameters are chosen suitably, then the sum of the $\\alpha$-moments of the steady-state queue lengths is finite. We provide an explicit upper bound for the latter quantity, from which we derive results related to the delay stability of traffic flows, and the scaling of moments of steady-state queue lengths with traffic intensity."}
