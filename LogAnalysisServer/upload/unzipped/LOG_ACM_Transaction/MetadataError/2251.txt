Our representation of structure is derived from an image-space analysis of modal object deformation: projections of an object's resonant modes are recovered from the temporal spectra of optical flow in a video, and used as a basis for the image-space simulation of object dynamics. We describe how to extract this basis from video, and show that it can be used to create physically-plausible animations of objects without any knowledge of scene geometry or material properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17475","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17475","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17476","fieldValue":" Blackboard-style lecture videos are popular, but learning using existing video player interfaces can be challenging. Viewers cannot consume the lecture material at their own pace, and the content is also difficult to search or skim. For these reasons, some people prefer lecture notes to videos. To address these limitations, we present Visual Transcripts, a readable representation of lecture videos that combines visual information with transcript text. To generate a Visual Transcript, we first segment the visual content of a lecture into discrete visual entities that correspond to equations, figures, or lines of text. Then, we analyze the temporal correspondence between the transcript and visuals to determine how sentences relate to visual entities. Finally, we arrange the text and visuals in a linear layout based on these relationships. We compare our result with a standard video player, and a state-of-the-art interface designed specifically for blackboard-style lecture videos. User evaluation suggests that users prefer our interface for learning and that our interface is effective in helping them browse or search through lecture videos."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17476","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17476","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2653","fieldValue":" We consider the exploration of a simple polygon P by a robot that moves from vertex to vertex along edges of the visibility graph of P. The visibility graph has a vertex for every vertex of P and an edge between two vertices if they see each otherâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, if the line segment connecting them lies inside P entirely. While located at a vertex, the robot is capable of ordering the vertices it sees in counterclockwise order as they appear on the boundary, and for every two such vertices, it can distinguish whether the angle between them is convex (&les; Ï\u20AC) or reflex ( > Ï\u20AC). Other than that, distant vertices are indistinguishable to the robot. We assume that an upper bound on the number of vertices is known. We obtain the general result that a robot exploring any locally oriented, arc-labeled graph G can always determine the base graph of G. Roughly speaking, this is the smallest graph that cannot be distinguished by a robot from G by its observations alone, no matter how it moves. Combining this result with various other techniques allows the ability to show that a robot exploring a polygon P with the preceding capabilities is always capable of reconstructing the visibility graph of P. We also show that multiple identical, indistinguishable, and deterministic robots of this kind can always solve the weak rendezvous problem in which they need to position themselves such that they mutually see each otherâ\u20AC\u201Dfor instance, such that they form a clique in the visibility graph."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2653","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2653","fieldValue":"ACM"}
