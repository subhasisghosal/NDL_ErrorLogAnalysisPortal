Traditional transcoding breaks the end-to-end model of the Web, because the proxy does not know the semantics of the content. Server-directed transcoding preserves end-to-end semantics while supporting aggressive content transformations.We show how server-directed transcoding can be integrated into the HTTP protocol and into the implementation of a proxy. We discuss several useful transformations for image content, and present measurements of the performance impacts. Our results demonstrate that server-directed transcoding is a natural extension to HTTP, can be implemented without great complexity, and can provide good performance when carefully implemented."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24288","fieldValue":"HTTP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24288","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24288","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24289","fieldValue":" We discuss the dangers that scalable Internet functionality may present to the real world, focusing upon an attack that is simple, yet can have great impact, which we believe may occur quite soon. We offer and critique various solutions to this class of attack and hope to provide a warning to the Internet community of what is currently possible. The attack is, to some degree, a consequence of the availability of private information on the Web, and the increase in the amount of personal information that users must reveal to obtain Web services."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24289","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24289","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3355","fieldValue":" Sound fields rotating around stationary blindfolded listeners sometimes elicit auditory circular vection, the illusion that the listener is physically rotating. Experiment 1 investigated whether auditory circular vection depends on participants' situational awareness of â\u20ACœmovability,â\u20AC? that is, whether they sense\/know that actual motion is possible or not. While previous studies often seated participants on movable chairs to suspend the disbelief of self-motion, it has never been investigated whether this does, in fact, facilitate auditory vection. To this end, 23 blindfolded participants were seated on a hammock chair with their feet either on solid ground (â\u20ACœmovement impossibleâ\u20AC?) or suspended (â\u20ACœmovement possibleâ\u20AC?) while listening to individualized binaural recordings of two sound sources rotating synchronously at 60Â°\/s. Although participants never physically moved, situational awareness of movability facilitated auditory vection. Moreover, adding slight vibrations like the ones resulting from actual chair rotation increased the frequency and intensity of vection. Experiment 2 extended these findings and showed that nonindividualized binaural recordings were as effective in inducing auditory circular vection as individualized recordings. These results have important implications both for our theoretical understanding of self-motion perception and for the applied field of self-motion simulations, where vibrations, nonindividualized binaural sound, and the cognitive\/perceptual framework of movability can typically be provided at minimal cost and effort."}
