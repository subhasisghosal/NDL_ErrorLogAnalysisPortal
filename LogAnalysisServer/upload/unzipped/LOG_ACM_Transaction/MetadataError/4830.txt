Starting from the design of transport protocols for streaming video, research interests have later shifted to the peer-to-peer paradigm of designing streaming protocols at the application layer. More recent research has focused on building more practical and scalable systems, using Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP. In this article, we provide a retrospective view of the research results over the past two decades, with a focus on peer-to-peer streaming protocols and the effects of cloud computing and social media."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25516","fieldValue":" The evolution of multimedia applications has drastically changed human life and behaviors. New communication technologies lead to new requirements for multimedia synchronization. This article presents a historical view of temporal synchronization studies focusing on continuous multimedia. We demonstrate how the development of multimedia systems has created new challenges for synchronization technologies. We conclude with a new application-dependent, multilocation, multirequirement synchronization framework to address these new challenges."}
