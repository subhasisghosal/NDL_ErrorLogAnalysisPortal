In this contribution, developed for sparse data, we present a new continuous Bayesian graphical learning algorithm to cotemporally model proteins in signaling networks and genes in transcriptional regulatory networks. In this continuous Bayesian algorithm, the correlation matrix is singular because the number of time points is less than the number of biological entities (genes or proteins). A suitable restriction on the degree of the graph's vertices is applied and a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is guided by a BIC-based posterior probability score. Ten independent and diverse runs of the algorithm are conducted, so that the probability space is properly well-explored. Diagnostics to test the applicability of the algorithm to the specific data sets are developed; this is a major benefit of the methodology. This novel algorithm is applied to two time course experimental data sets: 1) protein modification data identifying a potential signaling network in chondrocytes, and 2) gene expression data identifying the transcriptional regulatory network underlying dendritic cell maturation. This method gives high estimated posterior probabilities to many of the proteins' directed edges that are predicted by the literature; for the gene study, the method gives high posterior probabilities to many of the literature-predicted sibling edges. In simulations, the method gives substantially higher estimated posterior probabilities for true edges and true subnetworks than for their false counterparts."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4643","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4643","fieldValue":"Biological system modeling, statistical computing, multivariate statistics, correlation and regression analysis, signal transduction networks, transcriptional regulatory networks, biological network modeling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4643","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4643","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4644","fieldValue":" We discuss the propagation of constraints in eukaryotic interaction networks in relation to model prediction and the identification of critical pathways. In order to cope with posttranslational interactions, we consider two types of nodes in the network, corresponding to proteins and to RNA. Microarray data provides very lacunar information for such types of networks because protein nodes, although needed in the model, are not observed. Propagation of observations in such networks leads to poor and nonsignificant model predictions, mainly because rules used to propagate informationâ\u20AC\u201Dusually disjunctive constraintsâ\u20AC\u201Dare weak. Here, we propose a new, stronger type of logical constraints that allow us to strengthen the analysis of the relation between microarray and interaction data. We use these rules to identify the nodes which are responsible for a phenotype, in particular for cell cycle progression. As the benchmark, we use an interaction network describing major pathways implied in Ewing's tumor development. The Python library used to obtain our results is publicly available on our supplementary web page."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4644","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
