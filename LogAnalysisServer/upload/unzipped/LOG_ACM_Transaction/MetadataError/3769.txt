We examine a case where confidentiality is irrelevant to the process being modeled. In this case, integrity includes not only the authentication of origin and the lack of unauthorized changes to a document, but also the acceptance of all parties that the document is complete, signed by all parties, and cannot be modified further. This is especially critical when the document is recorded, so that it is legally the agreement or statement of record, and any copies of the document have no legal force. We show that current security models do not capture the details of this process. We then present a new security model for this process. This model captures the recordation process, and augments, rather than supplants, existing models. Hence it can also be used with existing security models to describe other situations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22170","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22170","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22171","fieldValue":" Several alert correlation methods have been proposed over the past several years to construct high-level attack scenarios from low-level intrusion alerts reported by intrusion detection systems (IDSs). However, all of these methods depend heavily on the underlying IDSs, and cannot deal with attacks missed by IDSs. In order to improve the performance of intrusion alert correlation and reduce the impact of missed attacks, this paper presents a series of techniques to hypothesize and reason about attacks possibly missed by the IDSs. In addition, this paper also discusses techniques to infer attribute values for hypothesized attacks, to validate hypothesized attacks through raw audit data, and to consolidate hypothesized attacks to generate concise attack scenarios. The experimental results in this paper demonstrate the potential of these techniques in building high-level attack scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22172","fieldValue":" This paper presents a new simple schemes for verifiable encryption of digital signatures.

In order to obtain a public key, verifiers need to extract a certificate path from a network of certificates, which is called public key infrastructure (PKI), and verify the certificates on this path recursively. This is classical methodology. Nested certification is a novel methodology for efficient certificate path verification. Basic idea is to issue special certificates (called nested certificates) for other certificates. Nested certificates can be used together with classical certificates in PKIs. Such a PKI, which is called nested certificate-based PKI (NPKI), is proposed in this paper as an alternative to classical PKI. The concept of \"certificates for other certificates\" results in nested certificate paths in which the first certificate is verified cryptographically while others are verified by just fast hash computations. Thus, we can employ efficiently verifiable nested certificate paths instead of classical certificate paths. NPKI is a dynamic system and involves several authorities in order to add a new user to the system. This uses the authorities' idle time to the benefit of the verifiers. We formulate the trade-off between the nested certification overhead and the time improvement on certificate path verification. This trade-off is numerically analyzed for a 4-level 20-ary balanced tree-shaped PKI and it has been shown that the extra cost of nested certification is in acceptable limits in order to generate quickly verifiable certificate paths for certain applications. Moreover, PKI-to-NPKI transition preserves the existing hierarchy and trust relationships in the PKI, so that it can be used for PKIs with fixed topology. Although there are many certificates in NPKI, certificate revocation is no more of a problem than with classical PKIs. NPKI even has an advantage on the number of certificate revocation controls: at most two certificate revocation controls are sufficient independent of the path length. Nested certificates can be easily adopted into X.509 standard certificate structure. Both verification efficiency and revocation advantage of NPKI and nested certificates make them suitable for hierarchical PKIs of wireless applications where wireless end users have limited processing power."}
