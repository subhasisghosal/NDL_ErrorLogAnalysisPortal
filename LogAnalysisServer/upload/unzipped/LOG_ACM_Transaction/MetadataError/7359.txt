We show that model checking is capable of providing an optimal solution and it arrives at these solutions faster (in terms of algorithm runtime) than equivalent ILP formulations. Furthermore, we also show how different types of optimizations such as task parallelism, data parallelism, and state sharing can be included within our framework. Finally, comparison of our approach with the current state-of-the-art heuristic techniques show the pitfalls of these techniques and gives a glimpse of how these heuristic techniques can be improved."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9529","fieldValue":" Time synchronization is critical in distributed environments. A variety of network protocols, middleware and business applications rely on proper time synchronization across the computational infrastructure and depend on the clock accuracy. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is the current widely accepted standard for synchronizing clocks over the Internet. NTP uses a hierarchical scheme in order to synchronize the clocks in the network. In this paper we present a novel non-hierarchical peer-to-peer approach for time synchronization termed CTP--Classless Time Protocol. This approach exploits convex optimization theory in order to evaluate the impact of each clock offset on the overall objective function. We define the clock offset problem as an optimization problem and derive its optimal solution. Based on the solution we develop a distributed protocol that can be implemented over a communication network, prove its convergence to the optimal clock offsets and show its properties. For compatibility, CTP may use the packet format and number of measurements used by NTP. We also present methodology and numerical results for evaluating and comparing the accuracy of time synchronization schemes. We show that the CTP outperforms hierarchical schemes such as NTP in the sense of clock accuracy with respect to a universal clock."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9529","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9529","fieldValue":"UTC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9530","fieldValue":" This paper proposes a new dynamic bandwidth allocation system for Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPONs), subject to requirements of fairness, efficiency, and cost. An Optical Line Terminal (OLT)-centric bandwidth allocation model is proposed which employs a credit pooling technique combined with a weighted-share policy to partition the upstream bandwidth among different classes of service, and to prevent Optical Network Units (ONUs) from monopolizing the bandwidth. The OLT-centric model allows global optimization of network resources, a characteristic which is not found in many earlier proposals. Supported by the new bandwidth allocation, the paper proposes a joint-ONU interval-based packet scheduling algorithm, referred to herein as COPS (Class-of-service Oriented Packet Scheduling), that meets the requirements set out above. We compare COPS with another well-known scheduling algorithm which employed a standard priority-based bandwidth sharing. We show that COPS is superior in terms of network utilization and maximum packet delay, with the consequence of an increase in average packet delay for the premium traffic. This drawback is overcome by combining COPS with a rate-based optimization scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9530","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
