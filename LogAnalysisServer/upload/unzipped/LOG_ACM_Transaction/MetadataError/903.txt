Under the assumption that the data in the database is taken from arbitrary integers, it is shown that essentially nothing can be inferred. It is also shown that when the values are known to be imprecise in some fixed range, one can often deduce the values of individual records."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13792","fieldValue":" Two modifications of B-trees are described, simple prefix B-trees and prefix B-trees. Both store only parts of keys, namely prefixes, in the index part of a B*-tree. In simple prefix B-trees those prefixes are selected carefully to minimize their length. In prefix B-trees the prefixes need not be fully stored, but are reconstructed as the tree is searched. Prefix B-trees are designed to combine some of the advantages of B-trees, digital search trees, and key compression techniques while reducing the processing overhead of compression techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/13792","fieldValue":"<italic>B<\/italic>-trees"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13793","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13793","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13794","fieldValue":" A generalized model for physical database organizations is presented.

The model provides a general design framework in which the distinguishing properties of database organizations are made explicit and their performances can be compared."}
