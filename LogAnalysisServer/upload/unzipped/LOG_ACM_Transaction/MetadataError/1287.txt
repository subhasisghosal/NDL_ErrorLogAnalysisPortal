Many computer applications (e.g., automatic contouring) need to perform interpolation only at the nodes of a given grid. Whereas most classical methods solve the problem by finding a function defined everywhere, the proposed method avoids explicitly computing such a function and instead produces values only at the grid points. For two-dimensional regular grids, a special case of this method is identical to the Briggs method (see ‚\u20ACúMachine Contouring Using Minimum Curvature,‚\u20AC? Geophysics 17, 1 (1974)), while another special case is equivalent to a discrete version of thin plate splines (see J. Duchon, Fonctions Splines du type Plaque Mince en Dimention 2, S√©minaire d'analyse num√©rique, n 231, U.S.M.G., Grenoble, 1975; and J. Enriquez, J. Thomann, and M.

By expressing the curve to be analyzed as a linear combination of control points, it can be transformed such that three of the control points are mapped to specific locations on the plane. We call this image curve the canonical curve. Affine maps do not affect inflection points, cusps, or loops, so the analysis can be applied to the canonical curve instead of the original one. Since the first three points are fixed, the canonical curve is completely characterized by the position of its fourth point. The analysis therefore reduces to observing which region of the canonical plane the fourth point occupies. We demonstrate that for all parametric cubes expressed in this form, the boundaries of these regions are tonics and straight lines. Special cases include B√©zier curves, B-splines, and Beta-splines. Such a characterization forms the basis for an easy and efficient solution to this problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15008","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15008","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15009","fieldValue":" A blending surface is a surface that smoothly connects two given surfaces along two arbitrary curves, one on each surface. This is particularly useful in the modeling operations of filleting a sharp edge between joining surfaces or connecting disjoint surfaces. In this paper we derive a new surface formulation for representing surfaces which are blends of parametric surfaces. The formulation has the advantage over the traditional rational polynomial approach in that point and normal values have no gaps between the blending surface and the base surfaces. Shape control parameters that control the cross-sectional shape of the blending surface are also available. In addition, the base surfaces are not restricted to any particular type of surface representation as long as they are parametrically defined and have a well-defined and continuous normal vector at each point. The scheme is extensible to higher orders of geometric continuity, although we concentrate on G1."}
