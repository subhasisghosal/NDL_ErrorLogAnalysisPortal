Dynamic routing in circuit-switched networks has been an active research topic. The literature to date in this area has focused on how to choose the \"best\" alternate route for overflow traffic from a direct route, within a network setting referred to as the backbone network. The traffic type considered in the literature has typically been one with a single destination. Least loaded routing (LLR) is an example of a state-dependent routing that selects the least loaded two-link alternate route when traffic overflows from the direct route. Motivated by the development of an emerging traffic type, called multidestination traffic, whose destination is not necessarily limited to a single location, we provide two routing strategies that deal with both the routing of the multiple-destination traffic to the extended network dimension, which is referred to as the destination network, and the routing of the backbone network traffic via LLR. In selecting the destination for multidestination traffic, SLLR employs static information, whereas DLLR employs real-time load status information concerning the destination links. We develop fixed-point models for both DLLR and SLLR. We also validate and compare the models through simulation. The results suggest that DLLR outperforms SLLR in all the scenarios, demonstrating the benefit of state-dependent routing in an end-to-end network. Further, the DLLR scheme improves if an \"incident preference\" rule is adopted; the rule allows a multidestination call to first choose the incident destination link, if any."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9126","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8347","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9127","fieldValue":" Fragmented IP traffic is a poorly understood component of the overall mix of traffic on the Internet. Many assertions about the nature and extent of fragmented traffic are anecdotal rather than empirical. In this paper we examine the causes and attributes of measured fragment traffic, in particular, the effects of NFS, streaming media, networked video games, tunneled traffic, and the prevalence of packet fragmentation due to improperly configured machines.To understand the prevalence, causes, and effects of fragmented IP traffic, we have collected and analyzed seven multiday traces from four sources. These sources include a university commodity access link, two highly aggregated commercial exchange points, and a local NAP. Although there is no practical method of ascertaining whether any data provide a representative sample of all Internet traffic, we include data sources that cover several different types of WANs with traffic from commercial entities, educational and research institutions, and large government facilities.The dominant causes of fragmentation are streaming media and tunneled traffic. Although rumored to be the main impetus for IP packet fragmentation, NFS is not among the top ten causes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9127","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9127","fieldValue":"TCP\/IP"}
