We propose a sound field reproduction method using horizontally arranged cylindrical arrays of microphones and loudspeakers, which is based on the wave field reconstruction (WFR) filter. With the use of cylindrical array configurations, it is possible to reproduce sound waves arriving from upper and lower directions with a smaller number of array elements at angular positions. The WFR filter is analytically derived in the cylindrical harmonic domain and allows direct transformation from the received signals of the microphones into the driving signals of the loudspeakers. A model in which microphones are mounted on a rigid cylindrical baffle is introduced to stabilize the WFR filter. Numerical simulation results indicated that the reproduction accuracy in the neighboring region along the central axis of the cylindrical array was better preserved when using the proposed method than when the method with planar arrays was used."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3701","fieldValue":"Wave field reconstruction filtering in cylindrical harmonic domain for with-height recording and reproduction"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3701","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3701","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1280","fieldValue":" The development of self-adaptive software requires the engineering of an adaptation engine that controls the underlying adaptable software by feedback loops. The engine often describes the adaptation by runtime models representing the adaptable software and by activities such as analysis and planning that use these models. To systematically address the interplay between runtime models and adaptation activities, runtime megamodels have been proposed. A runtime megamodel is a specific model capturing runtime models and adaptation activities. In this article, we go one step further and present an executable modeling language for ExecUtable RuntimE MegAmodels (EUREMA) that eases the development of adaptation engines by following a model-driven engineering approach. We provide a domain-specific modeling language and a runtime interpreter for adaptation engines, in particular feedback loops. Megamodels are kept alive at runtime and by interpreting them, they are directly executed to run feedback loops. Additionally, they can be dynamically adjusted to adapt feedback loops. Thus, EUREMA supports development by making feedback loops explicit at a higher level of abstraction and it enables solutions where multiple feedback loops interact or operate on top of each other and self-adaptation co-exists with offline adaptation for evolution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1280","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1280","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3702","fieldValue":"Chen, Chia-Ping"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3702","fieldValue":"Huang, Yi-Chin"}
