Topology recovery via tomographic inference is potentially an attractive complement to standard methods that use TTL-limited probes. Unfortunately, limitations of prior tomographic techniques make timely resolution of large-scale topologies impossible due to the requirement of an infeasible number of measurements. In this paper, we describe new techniques that aim toward efficient tomographic inference for accurate router-level topology measurement. We introduce methodologies based on Depth-First Search (DFS) ordering that clusters end-hosts based on shared infrastructure and enables the logical tree topology of a network to be recovered accurately and efficiently. We evaluate the capabilities of our algorithms in large-scale simulation and find that our methods will reconstruct topologies using less than 2%of the measurements required by exhaustive methods and less than 15% of the measurements needed by the current state-of-the-art tomographic approach. We also present results from a study of the live Internet where we show our DFS-based methodologies can recover the logical router-level topology more accurately and with fewer probes than prior techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10323","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1129","fieldValue":" In a survey on the theory and practice of agent system deployment, conducted by the AgentLink workgroup on networked agents, it was found that there are an increasing number of initiatives for the migration of agents research towards new Internet technologies such as the semantic web, Grid, and Web services. In fact, Grid computing and multi-agent systems research have similar objectives. They both aim to achieve â\u20ACœlarge-scale open distributed systems, capable of being able to effectively and dynamically deploy and redeploy computational (and other) resources as required, to solve computationally complex problemsâ\u20AC? [Foster and Kesselman 2003]. On the one hand, service-oriented Grid architectures need to support dynamic cooperation, negotiation, and adaptive interactions between Web services controlling Grid resources for efficient resource and task allocation and execution. On the other hand, the Grid can facilitate agent communication, life-cycle management, and access to resources for agents. Although the relevance of Grid for agent research and vice versa has been identified in several forums, actual collaborative applications are still in their infancy. In this article, we discuss our recent work on deploying multi-agent negotiation techniques to facilitate dynamic negotiation for Grid resources as a step closer to an adaptive and autonomous Grid. In particular, we describe a Web service development of the Contract Net Protocol for negotiation between insurance companies and repair companies. We evaluate our approach to show the added value of negotiable interactions between Web services as opposed to inflexible single-shot interactions that are currently the state of the art."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1129","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1129","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1939","fieldValue":"Adve, Sarita V"}
