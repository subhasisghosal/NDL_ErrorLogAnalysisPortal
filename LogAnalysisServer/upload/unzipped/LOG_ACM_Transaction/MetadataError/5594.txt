This problem was introduced to find functional motifs in biological networks. We present a branch-and-bound algorithm named RANGI for finding and enumerating list-colored graph motifs. As our experimental results show, RANGI's pruning methods and heuristics make it quite fast in practice compared to the algorithms presented in the literature. We also present a parallel version of RANGI that achieves acceptable scalability."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4919","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4919","fieldValue":"Color,Heuristic algorithms,Computational biology,Bioinformatics,Proteins,list-colored graphs,Color,Heuristic algorithms,Computational biology,Bioinformatics,Proteins,protein-interaction networks,Branch-and-bound algorithms,parallel algorithms"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4920","fieldValue":" The directionality of protein interactions is the prerequisite of forming various signaling networks, and the construction of signaling networks is a critical issue in the discovering the mechanism of the life process. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to infer the directionality in protein-protein interaction networks and furthermore construct signaling networks. Based on the functional annotations of proteins, we proposed a novel parameter GODS and established the prediction model. This method shows high sensitivity and specificity to predict the directionality of protein interactions, evaluated by fivefold cross validation. By taking the threshold value of GODS as 2, we achieved accuracy 95.56 percent and coverage 74.69 percent in the human test set. Also, this method was successfully applied to reconstruct the classical signaling pathways in human. This study not only provided an effective method to unravel the unknown signaling pathways, but also the deeper understanding for the signaling networks, from the aspect of protein function."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4920","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4920","fieldValue":"Proteins,Accuracy,Training,Humans,Protein engineering,Bioinformatics,Predictive models,gene ontology,Proteins,Accuracy,Training,Humans,Protein engineering,Bioinformatics,Predictive models,cross validation,Signaling network,protein interaction"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4920","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4920","fieldValue":"ACM"}
