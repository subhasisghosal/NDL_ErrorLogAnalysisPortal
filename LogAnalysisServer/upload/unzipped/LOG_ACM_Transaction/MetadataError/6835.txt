Computer-mediated communication research shows that communication patterns play an important role in the collaborative efforts of online knowledge-sharing activities. Existing research is mainly focused on either user egocentric positions in communication networks or communication patterns at the community level. Very few studies examine thread-level communication and process patterns and their impacts on the effectiveness of knowledge sharing. In this study, we fill this research gap by proposing an innovative analytical framework for understanding thread-level knowledge sharing in online Q&A communities based on dialogue act theory, network analysis, and process mining. More specifically, we assign a dialogue act tag for each post in a discussion thread to capture its conversation purpose and then apply graph and process mining algorithms to examine knowledge-sharing processes. Our results, which are based on a real support forum dataset, show that the proposed analytical framework is effective in identifying important communication, conversation, and process patterns that lead to helpful knowledge sharing in online Q&A communities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8230","fieldValue":" Business process analysis and process mining, particularly within the health care domain, remain under-utilized. Applied research that employs such techniques to routinely collected health care data enables stakeholders to empirically investigate care as it is delivered by different health providers. However, cross-organizational mining and the comparative analysis of processes present a set of unique challenges in terms of ensuring population and activity comparability, visualizing the mined models, and interpreting the results. Without addressing these issues, health providers will find it difficult to use process mining insights, and the potential benefits of evidence-based process improvement within health will remain unrealized. In this article, we present a brief introduction on the nature of health care processes, a review of process mining in health literature, and a case study conducted to explore and learn how health care data and cross-organizational comparisons with process-mining techniques may be approached. The case study applies process-mining techniques to administrative and clinical data for patients who present with chest pain symptoms at one of four public hospitals in South Australia. We demonstrate an approach that provides detailed insights into clinical (quality of patient health) and fiscal (hospital budget) pressures in the delivery of health care. We conclude by discussing the key lessons learned from our experience in conducting business process analysis and process mining based on the data from four different hospitals."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8231","fieldValue":"Liao, Stephen S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8231","fieldValue":" When designing a business process, individual agents are assigned to perform tasks based on certain goals (i.e., designed process goals). However, based on their own interests, real-world agents often have different goals (i.e., agentsâ\u20AC™ goals) and thus may behave differently than designed, often resulting in reduced effectiveness or efficiencies of the executed process. Moreover, existing business process research lacks effective methods for discovering agentsâ\u20AC™ goals in the actual execution of the designed business processes. To address this problem, we propose an agent-oriented goal mining approach to modeling, discovering, and analyzing agentsâ\u20AC™ goals in executed business processes using historical event logs and domain data. To the best of our knowledge, our research is the first to adopt the agentsâ\u20AC™ goal perspective to study inconsistencies between the design and execution of business processes. Moreover, it also provides a useful tool for stakeholders to discover real-world agentsâ\u20AC™ actual goals and thus provides insights for improving the task assignment mechanism or business process design in general."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8231","fieldValue":"ACM"}
