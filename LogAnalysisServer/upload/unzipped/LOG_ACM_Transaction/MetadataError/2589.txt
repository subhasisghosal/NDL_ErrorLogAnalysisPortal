The intended purpose of the software is to find a few eigenpairs of a dense nonsymmetric matrix faster and more accurately than previous methods. The performance and accuracy of the new routines are compared to two EISPACK paths: RG and HQR-INVIT. The results show that the new routines are more accurate and also faster if less than 20 percent of the eigenpairs are needed."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18723","fieldValue":"Algorithm 710: FORTRAN subroutines for computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a general matrix by reduction to general tridiagonal form"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18723","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18723","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18724","fieldValue":" This paper presents a computational procedure for solving combined discrete-time optimal control and optimal parameter selection problems subject to general constraints. The approach adopted is to convert the problem into a nonlinear programming problem which can be solved using standard optimization software. The main features of the procedure are the way the controls are parametrized and the conversion of all constraints into a standard form suitable for computation. The software is available commercially as a FORTRAN program DMISER3 together with a companion program MISER3 for solving continuous-time problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18724","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18724","fieldValue":"ACM"}
