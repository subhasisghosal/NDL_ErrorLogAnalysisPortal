The user can choose to generate a surface that exactly interpolates the polygons, or a surface that approximates the input by smoothing away features smaller than some user-specified size. The implicit functions are represented using a moving least-squares formulation with constraints integrated over the polygons. The paper also presents an improved method for enforcing normal constraints and an iterative procedure for ensuring that the implicit surface tightly encloses the input vertices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15478","fieldValue":"Cohen-Steiner, David"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15478","fieldValue":" A method for concise, faithful approximation of complex 3D datasets is key to reducing the computational cost of graphics applications. Despite numerous applications ranging from geometry compression to reverse engineering, efficiently capturing the geometry of a surface remains a tedious task. In this paper, we present both theoretical and practical contributions that result in a novel and versatile framework for geometric approximation of surfaces. We depart from the usual strategy by casting shape approximation as a variational geometric partitioning problem. Using the concept of geometric proxies, we drive the distortion error down through repeated clustering of faces into best-fitting regions. Our approach is entirely discrete and error-driven, and does not require parameterization or local estimations of differential quantities. We also introduce a new metric based on normal deviation, and demonstrate its superior behavior at capturing anisotropy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15478","fieldValue":"ACM"}
