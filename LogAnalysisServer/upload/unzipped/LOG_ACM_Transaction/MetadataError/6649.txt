In this article, we present a software retrieval service that allows users to select and retrieve software in an easy and efficient way, anywhere and anytime. Two relevant components of this service are: 1) a software ontology (software catalog) which provides users with a semantic description of software elements, hiding the location and access method of various software repositories, and 2) a set of specialist agents that allow browsing of the software catalog (automatically customized for each user), and an efficient retrieval method for the selected software. These agents automatically adapt their behavior to different users and situations by considering the profile and preferences of the users and the network status.In summary, our software-obtaining process based on an ontology and autonomous and adaptive agents presents a qualitative advance with respect to existing solutions: our approach adapts to the features of users, relieving them from knowing the technical features of their devices and the location and access method of various remote software repositories."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1699","fieldValue":" As technology has advanced, the application space of Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors has grown to include a variety of embedded platforms. Due to cost and power consumption constraints, many embedded VLIW processors contain limited resources, including registers. As a result, a VLIW compiler that maximizes instruction level parallelism (ILP) without considering register constraints may generate excessive register spills, leading to reduced overall system performance. To address this issue, this article presents a new spill reduction technique that improves VLIW runtime performance by reordering operations prior to register allocation and instruction scheduling. Unlike earlier algorithms, our approach explicitly considers both register reduction and data dependency in performing operation reordering. Data dependency control limits unexpected schedule length increases during subsequent instruction scheduling. Our technique has been evaluated using Trimaran, an academic VLIW compiler, and evaluated using a set of embedded systems benchmarks. Experimental results show that, on average, this technique improves VLIW performance by 10&percnt; for VLIW processors with 32 registers and 8 functional units compared with previous spill reduction techniques. Limited improvement is seen versus prior approaches for VLIW processors with 64 registers and 8 functional units."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1699","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1699","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7702","fieldValue":" It is a necessary but challenging task to relieve users from the proliferative news information and allow them to quickly and comprehensively master the information of the whats and hows that are happening in the world every day. In this article, we develop a novel approach of multimedia news summarization for searching results on the Internet, which uncovers the underlying topics among query-related news information and threads the news events within each topic to generate a query-related brief overview. First, the hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (hLDA) model is introduced to discover the hierarchical topic structure from query-related news documents, and a new approach based on the weighted aggregation and max pooling is proposed to identify one representative news article for each topic. One representative image is also selected to visualize each topic as a complement to the text information. Given the representative documents selected for each topic, a time-bias maximum spanning tree (MST) algorithm is proposed to thread them into a coherent and compact summary of their parent topic. Finally, we design a friendly interface to present users with the hierarchical summarization of their required news information. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale news dataset collected from multiple news Web sites demonstrate the encouraging performance of the proposed solution for news summarization in news retrieval."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7702","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7702","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7703","fieldValue":" The machine recognition of user trajectories and activities is fundamental to devise context-aware applications for support and monitoring in daily life. So far, tracking and activity recognition were mostly considered as orthogonal problems, which limits the richness of possible context inference. In this work, we introduce the novel unified computational and representational framework S-SMART that simultaneously models the environment state (semantic mapping), localizes the user within this map (tracking), and recognizes interactions with the environment (activity recognition). Thus, S-SMART identifies which activities the user executes where (e.g., turning a handle next to a window), and reflects the outcome of these actions by updating the world model (e.g., the window is now open). This in turn conditions the future possibility of executing actions at specific places (e.g., closing the window is likely to be the next action at this location). S-SMART works in a self-contained manner and iteratively builds the semantic map from wearable sensors only. This enables the seamless deployment to new environments. We characterize S-SMART in an experimental dataset with people performing hand actions as part of their usual routines at home and in office buildings. The framework combines dead reckoning from a foot-worn motion sensor with template-matching-based action recognition, identifying objects in the environment (windows, doors, water taps, phones, etc.) and tracking their state (open\/closed, etc.). In real-life recordings with up to 23 action classes, S-SMART consistently outperforms independent systems for positioning and activity recognition, and constructs accurate semantic maps. This environment representation enables novel applications that build upon information about the arrangement and state of the userâ\u20AC™s surroundings. For example, it may be possible to remind elderly people of a window that they left open before leaving the house, or of a plant they did not water yet, using solely wearable sensors."}
