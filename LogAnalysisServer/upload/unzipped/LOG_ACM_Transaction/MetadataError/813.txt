{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13389","fieldValue":" Dynamic power management has become an imperative design factor to attain the energy efficiency in modern systems. Among various power management schemes, learning-based policies that are adaptive to different environments and applications have demonstrated superior performance to other approaches. However, they suffer the scalability problem for multiprocessors due to the increasing number of cores in a system. In this article, we propose a scalable and effective online policy called MultiLevel Reinforcement Learning (MLRL). By exploiting the hierarchical paradigm, the time complexity of MLRL is O(n lg n) for n cores and the convergence rate is greatly raised by compressing redundant searching space. Some advanced techniques, such as the function approximation and the action selection scheme, are included to enhance the generality and stability of the proposed policy. By simulating on the SPLASH-2 benchmarks, MLRL runs 53&percnt; faster and outperforms the state-of-the-art work with 13.6&percnt; energy saving and 2.7&percnt; latency penalty on average. The generality and the scalability of MLRL are also validated through extensive simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13390","fieldValue":" WaveSync is a network-on-chip architecture for a globally asynchronous locally-synchronous (GALS) design. The WaveSync design facilitates low-latency communication leveraging the source-synchronous clock sent along with the data to time components in the datapath of a downstream router, reducing the number of synchronizations needed. WaveSync accomplishes this by partitioning the router components at each node into different clock domains, each synchronized with one of the orthogonal incoming source-synchronous clocks in a GALS 2D mesh network. The data and clock subsequently propagate through each node\/router synchronously until the destination is reached, regardless of the number of hops this may take. As long as the data travels in the path of clock propagation and no congestion is encountered, it will be propagated without latching as if in a long combinatorial path, with both the clock and the data accruing delay at the same rate. The result is that the need for synchronization between the mesochronous nodes and\/or the asynchronous control associated with the typical GALS network is completely eliminated. To further reduce the latency overhead of synchronization, for those occasions when synchronization is still required (when a flit takes a turn or arrives at the destination), we propose a novel less-than-one-cycle synchronizer. The proposed WaveSync network outperforms conventional GALS networks by 87--90&percnt; in average latency, synthesized using a 45nm CMOS library."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13390","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13390","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13391","fieldValue":" The efficiency and effectiveness of an adaptive router in an NoC-based multicore system is evaluated by the performance it achieves under varying inter-core communication traffic. A well-designed selection strategy plays an important role in an adaptive router to act upon dynamic traffic variations. The effectiveness of a selection strategy depends on what metric is used to represent congestion, how precisely this metric captures the actual congestion, and how much cost is involved in capturing the congestion on a real-time scale. Congestion is formed over a period of time due to cumulative and chain reaction effects. We propose novel history-based selection strategies that could be used with any adaptive, deadlock-free, minimal routing in mesh NoCs. Buffer occupancy time and rate of flit flow across reachable ports of neighboring routers in the recent past are captured, propagated, and maintained in a cost-effective way to compute the selection metric. Experimental results on real and synthetic workloads show that our proposed selection strategies significantly outperform state-of-the-art techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13391","fieldValue":"Implementation and Analysis of History-Based Output Channel Selection Strategies for Adaptive Routers in Mesh NoCs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13391","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13391","fieldValue":"ACM"}
