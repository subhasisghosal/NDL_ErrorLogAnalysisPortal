The main attractive feature of DRR is its simplicity of implementation: in fact, it can exhibit O(1) complexity, provided that specific allocation constraints are met. However, according to the original DRR implementation, meeting such constraints often implies tolerating high latency and poor fairness. In this paper, we first derive new and exact bounds for DRR latency and fairness. On the basis of these results, we then propose a novel implementation technique, called Active List Queue Method (Aliquem), which allows a remarkable gain in latency and fairness to be achieved, while still preserving O(1) complexity. We show that DRR achieves better performance metrics than those of other round-robin algorithms such as Pre-Order Deficit Round-Robin and Smoothed Round-Robin. We also show by simulation that the proposed implementation allows the average delay and the jitter to be reduced."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9241","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9242","fieldValue":" A recently proposed active queue management, CHOKe, is stateless, simple to implement, yet surprisingly effective in protecting TCP from UDP flows. We present an equilibrium model of TCP\/CHOKe. We prove that, provided the number of TCP flows is large, the UDP bandwidth share peaks at (e + $1)^-1$=0.269 when UDP input rate is slightly larger than link capacity, and drops to zero as UDP input rate tends to infinity. We clarify the spatial characteristics of the leaky buffer under CHOKe that produce this throughput behavior. Specifically, we prove that, as UDP input rate increases, even though the total number of UDP packets in the queue increases, their spatial distribution becomes more and more concentrated near the tail of the queue, and drops rapidly to zero toward the head of the queue. In stark contrast to a nonleaky FIFO buffer where UDP bandwidth shares would approach 1 as its input rate increases without bound, under CHOKe, UDP simultaneously maintains a large number of packets in the queue and receives a vanishingly small bandwidth share, the mechanism through which CHOKe protects TCP flows."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9242","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9243","fieldValue":"Reddy, A.

The idea of the proposed scheme is that if the observed queue length and packet drop probability do not match the predictions from a model of responsive (TCP) traffic, then the error must come from nonresponsive traffic; it can then be used for estimating the proportion of nonresponsive traffic. The proposed scheme is based on the queue length history, packet drop history, and expected TCP and queue dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme over a wide range of traffic scenarios is corroborated using ns-2-based simulations. Potential applications of the proposed algorithms in traffic engineering and control are discussed."}
