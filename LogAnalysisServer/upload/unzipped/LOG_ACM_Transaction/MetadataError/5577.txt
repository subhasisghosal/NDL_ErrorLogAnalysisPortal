{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4891","fieldValue":" With the rapid development of high-throughput experiment techniques for protein-protein interaction (PPI) detection, a large amount of PPI network data are becoming available. However, the data produced by these techniques have high levels of spurious and missing interactions. This study assigns a new reliably indication for each protein pairs via the new generative network model (RIGNM) where the scale-free property of the PPI network is considered to reliably identify both spurious and missing interactions in the observed high-throughput PPI network. The experimental results show that the RIGNM is more effective and interpretable than the compared methods, which demonstrate that this approach has the potential to better describe the PPI networks and drive new discoveries."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4891","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4891","fieldValue":"Proteins,Reliability,Biological system modeling,Humans,Data models,Noise measurement,PPI data denoising,Protein-protein interaction network,generative network model"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4891","fieldValue":"Identifying Spurious Interactions and Predicting Missing Interactions in the Protein-Protein Interaction Networks via a Generative Network Model"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4891","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4891","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4892","fieldValue":" The Largest Common Point-set (LCP) and the Pattern Matching (PM) problems have received much attention in the fields of pattern matching, computer vision and computational biology. Perhaps, the most important application of these problems is the protein structural alignment, which seeks to find a superposition of a pair of input proteins that maximizes a given protein structure similarity metric. Although it has been shown that LCP and PM are both tractable problems, the running times of existing algorithms are high-degree polynomials. Here, we present novel methods for finding approximate and exact threshold-LCP and threshold-PM for r-separated sets, in general, and protein 3D structures, in particular. Improved running times of our methods are achieved by building upon several different, previously published techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4892","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4892","fieldValue":"Proteins,Approximation algorithms,Approximation methods,Pattern matching,Computational biology,Bioinformatics,Polynomials,structural alignment,Pattern matching,protein structure"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4892","fieldValue":"ACM"}
