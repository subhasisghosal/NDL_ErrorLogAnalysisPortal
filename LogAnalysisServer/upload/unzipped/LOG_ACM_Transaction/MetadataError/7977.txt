Conventionally, the main performance gain of this caching was thought to result from making part of the requested data available closer to end-users. Instead, we recently showed that a much more significant gain can be achieved by using caches to create coded-multicasting opportunities, even for users with different demands, through coding across data streams. These coded-multicasting opportunities are enabled by careful content overlap at the various caches in the network, created by a central coordinating server. In many scenarios, such a central coordinating server may not be available, raising the question if this multicasting gain can still be achieved in a more decentralized setting. In this paper, we propose an efficient caching scheme, in which the content placement is performed in a decentralized manner. In other words, no coordination is required for the content placement. Despite this lack of coordination, the proposed scheme is nevertheless able to create coded-multicasting opportunities and achieves a rate close to the optimal centralized scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10773","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10773","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10773","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10774","fieldValue":" Because data dissemination is crucial to wireless sensor networks (WSNs), its energy efficiency and reliability are of paramount importance. While achieving these two goals together is highly nontrivial, the situation is exacerbated if WSN nodes are duty-cycled (DC) and their transmission power is adjustable. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the expected total transmission power for reliable data dissemination (multicast\/broadcast) in DC-WSNs. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we design efficient approximation algorithms with provable performance bounds for it. To facilitate our algorithm design, we propose the novel concept of Time-Reliability-Power (TRP) space as a general data structure for designing data dissemination algorithms in WSNs, and the performance ratios of our algorithms based on the TRP space are proven to be O (log Î\u201D log k)for both multicast and broadcast, where Î\u201D is the maximum node degree in the network and k is the number of source\/destination nodes involved in a data dissemination session. We also conduct extensive simulations to firmly demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10774","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10774","fieldValue":"ACM"}
