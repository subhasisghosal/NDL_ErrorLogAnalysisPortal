A property owner embeds a small tag inside the asset to be protected, where the tag lies dormant until it detects vehicular movement. Once moved, the tag uses inertial sensor-based dead reckoning to estimate position changes, but to reduce integration errors, the relative position is reset whenever the sensors indicate the vehicle has stopped. The sequence of movements, stops, and turns are logged in compact form and eventually transferred to a server using a cellular modem after both sufficient time has passed (to avoid detection) and RF power is detectable (hinting cellular access may be available). Eventually, the trajectory data are sent to a server which attempts to match a path to the observations. The algorithm uses a Hidden Markov Model of city streets and Viterbi decoding to estimate the most likely path. The proposed design leverages low-power radios and inertial sensors, is immune to intransit cloaking, and supports post hoc path reconstruction. Our prototype demonstrates technical viability of the design; the volume market forces driving machine-to-machine communications will soon make the design economically viable."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21391","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21391","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21392","fieldValue":"Zhang, Zhi-Li"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21392","fieldValue":" Energy is the most precious resource in sensor networks. The ability to move energy around makes it feasible to build distributed energy storage systems that can robustly extend the lifetime of networked sensor systems. eShare supports the concept of energy sharing among multiple embedded sensor devices by providing designs for energy routers (i.e., energy storage and routing devices) and related energy access and network protocols. In a nutshell, energy routers exchange energy sharing control information using their data network while sharing energy freely among connected embedded sensor devices using their energy network. To improve sharing efficiency subject to energy leakage, we develop an effective energy charging and discharging mechanism using an array of ultra-capacitors as the main component of an energy router. We extensively evaluate our system under seven real-world settings. Results indicate our charging and discharging control can effectively minimize the energy leaked away. Moreover, the energy sharing protocol can quantitatively share 113J energy with 96.82&percnt; accuracy in less than 2 seconds."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21392","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21392","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21393","fieldValue":" We study the problem of optimal sensor placement in the context of soil moisture sensing. We show that the soil moisture data possesses some unique features that can be used together with the commonly used Gaussian assumption to construct more scalable, robust, and better performing placement algorithms. Specifically, there exists a coarse-grained monotonic ordering of locations in their soil moisture level over time, both in terms of its first and second moments, a feature much more stable than the soil moisture process itself at these locations. This motivates a clustered sensor placement scheme, where locations are classified into clusters based on the ordering of the mean, with the number of sensors placed in each cluster determined by the ordering of the variances. We show that under idealized conditions the greedy mutual information maximization algorithm applied globally is equivalent to that applied cluster by cluster, but the latter has the advantage of being more scalable. Extensive numerical experiments are performed on a set of three-dimensional soil moisture data generated by a state-of-the-art soil moisture simulator. Our results show that our clustering approach outperforms applying the same algorithms globally, and is very robust to lack of training and errors in training data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21393","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21393","fieldValue":"ACM"}
