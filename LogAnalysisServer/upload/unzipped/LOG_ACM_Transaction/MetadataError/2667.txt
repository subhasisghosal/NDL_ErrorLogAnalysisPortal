The package provides good exception handling, flexible input and output, trace features, and results that are almost always correctly rounded. For best efficiency on different machines, the user can change the arithmetic type used to represent the multiple-precision numbers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/18926","fieldValue":"ines, Eivor"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18926","fieldValue":" A new stiffness detection scheme based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods is proposed. It uses a Krylov subspace approximation to estimate the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the differential system. The numerical examples indicate that this technique is a worthwhile alternative to other known stiffness detection schemes, especially when the systems are large and when it is desirable to know more about the spectrum of the Jacobian than just the spectral radius."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18927","fieldValue":" Several inprovements to algorithm 761 are presented.
