It is difficult to acquire such information from customer usage data because voice minutes and data bandwidth are typically sold in the form of large quotas. We address this issue by studying how end-users consume their quotas, both in a prepaid setting (where users pay in advance and refill as needed) and a postpaid setting (where users pay each month for a fixed amount of quota). Our presentation has three main parts. In the first we present data on quota usage for prepaid voice\/text services and show that users reduce their voice usage when their balances become low. Moreover, when balances are low there is a tendency to shift from voice to SMS. In the second part, we provide descriptive models of both prepaid and postpaid services. The main feature of these models is that there is a background level of potential demand and the rate at which this potential demand is realized depends on the amount of quota balance available. In the third part, we propose utility maximizing models that can account for this type of behavior. In the prepaid case the main feature of the model is a discount function that represents the perceived cost to the user of a quota refill that will occur sometime in the future. In the postpaid case, where the end-user is attempting to get the maximum amount of utility from his monthly quota, we present a dynamic programming formulation in which utility functions are time varying and not known to the user in advance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24480","fieldValue":" We introduce a private commons model that consists of network providers who serve a fixed primary demand and strategically price to improve their revenues from an additional secondary demand. For general forms of secondary demand, we establish the existence and uniqueness of two characteristic prices: the break-even price and the market sharing price. We show that the market sharing price is always greater than the break-even price, leading to a price interval in which a provider is both profitable and willing to share the demand. Making use of this result, we give insight into the nature of market outcomes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24480","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24480","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24481","fieldValue":" We study combinatorial auctions for secondary spectrum markets, where short-term communication licenses are sold to wireless nodes. Channels can be assigned to multiple bidders according to interference constraints captured by a conflict graph. We suggest a novel approach to such combinatorial auctions using a graph parameter called inductive independence number. We achieve good approximation results by showing that interference constraints for wireless networks imply a bounded inductive independence number. For example, in the physical model the factor becomes O(âˆšk $log^2$ n) for n bidders and k channels. Our algorithms can be turned into incentive-compatible mechanisms for bidders with arbitrary valuations."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24481","fieldValue":"SINR"}
