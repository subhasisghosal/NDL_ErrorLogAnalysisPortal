We present an algorithm that combines these two kinds of estimates to produce a new surface that approximates both. Our formulation is linear, allowing it to operate efficiently on complex meshes commonly used in graphics. It also treats high-and low-frequency components separately, allowing it to optimally combine outputs from data sources such as stereo triangulation and photometric stereo, which have different error-vs.-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the ability of our technique to both recover high-frequency details and avoid low-frequency bias, producing surfaces that are more widely applicable than position or orientation data alone."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15530","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15530","fieldValue":" We introduce a robust moving least-squares technique for reconstructing a piecewise smooth surface from a potentially noisy point cloud. We use techniques from robust statistics to guide the creation of the neighborhoods used by the moving least squares (MLS) computation. This leads to a conceptually simple approach that provides a unified framework for not only dealing with noise, but also for enabling the modeling of surfaces with sharp features.Our technique is based on a new robust statistics method for outlier detection: the forward-search paradigm. Using this powerful technique, we locally classify regions of a point-set to multiple outlier-free smooth regions. This classification allows us to project points on a locally smooth region rather than a surface that is smooth everywhere, thus defining a piecewise smooth surface and increasing the numerical stability of the projection operator. Furthermore, by treating the points across the discontinuities as outliers, we are able to define sharp features. One of the nice features of our approach is that it automatically disregards outliers during the surface-fitting phase."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2472","fieldValue":"IV, Atlas F Cook"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2472","fieldValue":" We present an alternative to parametric search that applies to both the nongeodesic and geodesic Fréchet optimization problems. This randomized approach is based on a variant of red-blue intersections and is appealing due to its elegance and practical efficiency when compared to parametric search. We introduce the first algorithm to compute the geodesic Fréchet distance between two polygonal curves A and B inside a simple bounding polygon P. The geodesic Fréchet decision problem is solved almost as fast as its nongeodesic sibling in $O(N^2 log k) time and O(k+N) space after O(k) preprocessing, where N is the larger of the complexities of A and B and k is the complexity of P. The geodesic Fréchet optimization problem is solved by a randomized approach in O(k+N2 log kN log N) expected time and O(k+N2$) space. This runtime is only a logarithmic factor larger than the standard nongeodesic Fréchet algorithm &lsqb;Alt and Godau 1995&rsqb;. Results are also presented for the geodesic Fréchet distance in a polygonal domain with obstacles and the geodesic Hausdorff distance for sets of points or sets of line segments inside a simple polygon P."}
