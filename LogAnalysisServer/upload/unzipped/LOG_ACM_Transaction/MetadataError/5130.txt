This is done because there was a belief that the phase spectrum is unimportant for speech enhancement. Recent studies, however, suggest that phase is important for perceptual quality, leading some researchers to consider magnitude and phase spectrum enhancements. We present a supervised monaural speech separation approach that simultaneously enhances the magnitude and phase spectra by operating in the complex domain. Our approach uses a deep neural network to estimate the real and imaginary components of the ideal ratio mask defined in the complex domain. We report separation results for the proposed method and compare them to related systems. The proposed approach improves over other methods when evaluated with several objective metrics, including the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), and a listening test where subjects prefer the proposed approach with at least a 69% rate."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3984","fieldValue":" Source localization and enhancement are often treated separately in the array processing literature. One can apply steered response power (SRP) localization to determine the sources' Directions-Of-Arrival (DOA) followed by beamforming and Wiener post-filtering to isolate the sources from each other and ambient interference. We show that when there is significant overlap between directional sources of interest in the time-frequency (TF) plane, traditional SRP localization breaks down. This may occur, for example, when the array is located near a reflector, significant early reflections are present, or the sources are harmonized. We propose a joint solution to the localization and enhancement problems via a probabilistic interpretation of the SRP function. We formulate optimization procedures for (1) a mixture of single-source SRP distributions (MoSRP) and (2) a multi-source SRP distribution (MultSRP). Unlike in traditional localization, the latter approach explicitly models source overlap in the TF plane. Results shows that the MultSRP model is capable of localizing sources with significant overlap in the TF domain and that either of the proposed methods out-performs standard SRP localization for multiple speakers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3984","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3984","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3985","fieldValue":"Tan, Zheng-Hua"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3985","fieldValue":" In total variability modeling, variable length speech utterances are mapped to fixed low-dimensional i-vectors. Central to computing the total variability matrix and i-vector extraction, is the computation of the posterior distribution for a latent variable conditioned on an observed feature sequence of an utterance. In both cases the prior for the latent variable is assumed to be non-informative, since for homogeneous datasets there is no gain in generality in using an informative prior. This work shows in the heterogeneous case, that using informative priors for computing the posterior, can lead to favorable results. We focus on modeling the priors using minimum divergence criterion or factor analysis techniques. Tests on the NIST 2008 and 2010 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE) dataset show that our proposed method beats four baselines: For i-vector extraction using an already trained matrix, for the short2-short3 task in SRE'08, five out of eight female and four out of eight male common conditions, were improved. For the core-extended task in SRE'10, four out of nine female and six out of nine male common conditions were improved. When incorporating prior information into the training of the T matrix itself, the proposed method beats the baselines for six out of eight female and five out of eight male common conditions, for SRE'08, and five and six out of nine conditions, for the male and female case, respectively, for SRE'10. Tests using factor analysis for estimating priors show that two priors do not offer much improvement, but in the case of three separate priors (sparse data), considerable improvements were gained."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3985","fieldValue":"ACM"}
