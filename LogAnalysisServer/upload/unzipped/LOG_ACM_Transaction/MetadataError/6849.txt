{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1746","fieldValue":" An important aspect of system optimization research is the discovery of program traits or behaviors. In this paper, we present an automated method of program characterization which is able to examine and cluster program graphs, i.e., dynamic data graphs or control flow graphs. Our novel approximate graph clustering technology allows users to find groups of program fragments which contain similar code idioms or patterns in data reuse, control flow, and context. Patterns of this nature have several potential applications including development of new static or dynamic optimizations to be implemented in software or in hardware. For the SPEC CPU 2006 suite of benchmarks, our results show that approximate graph clustering is effective at grouping behaviorally similar functions. Graph based clustering also produces clusters that are more homogeneous than previously proposed non-graph based clustering methods. Further qualitative analysis of the clustered functions shows that our approach is also able to identify some frequent unexploited program behaviors. These results suggest that our approximate graph clustering methods could be very useful for program characterization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1746","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1746","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8260","fieldValue":" Requirements elicitation consists in collecting and documenting information about the requirements from a system-to-be and about the environment of that system. Elicitation forms a critical step in the design of any information system, subject to many challenges like information incompleteness, variability, or ambiguity. To deal with these challenges, requirements engineers heavily rely on stakeholders, who turn out to be one of the most significant provider of information during elicitation. Sometimes, this comes at the cost of less attention being paid by engineers to other sources of information accessible in a business. In this article, we try to deal with this issue by studying the different sources of information that can be used by engineers when designing a system. We propose TELIS (a Taxonomy of Elicitation Sources), which can be used during elicitation to review more systematically the sources of information about a system-to-be. TELIS was produced through a series of empirical studies and was partially validated through a real-world case study. Our objective in this article is to increase the awareness of engineers about the other information providers within a business. Ultimately, we believe our taxonomy may help in better dealing with classical elicitation challenges and increase the chances of successful information systems design."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8260","fieldValue":"Are Stakeholders the Only Source of Information for Requirements Engineers?

Such availability patterns heavily influence the efficiency and effectiveness of enterprise resource management. Most existing process scheduling and resource management approaches tend to tune the process structure to seek better resource utilisation, yet neglect the constraints on resource availability. In this article, we investigate the scheduling of business process instances in accordance with resource availability patterns, to find out how enterprise resources can be rationally and sufficiently used. Three heuristic-based planning strategies are proposed to maximise the process instance throughput together with another strategy based on a genetic algorithm. The performance of these strategies has been evaluated by conducting experiments of different settings and analysing the strategy characteristics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8261","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8261","fieldValue":"ACM"}
