Error confinement means that to the external observer, only nodes that were directly hit by a fault may deviate from their specified correct behavior, and only temporarily. The externally observable behavior of all other nodes must remain impeccable, even though their internal state may be affected. Error confinement is impossible if an adversary is allowed to inflict arbitrary transient faults on the system, since the faults might completely wipe out input values. We introduce a new fault-tolerance measure we call agility, which quantifies the fault tolerance of an algorithm that disseminates information against state corrupting faults. We then propose broadcast algorithms that guarantee error confinement with optimal agility to within a constant factor in synchronous networks. These algorithms can serve as building blocks in more general reactive systems. Previous results in exploring locality in reactive systems were not error confined, or allowed a wide range of behaviors to be considered correct. Our results also include a new technique that can be used to analyze the â\u20ACœcow pathâ\u20AC? problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2439","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2439","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15198","fieldValue":"OSullivan, Carol"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15198","fieldValue":" Level of Detail (LOD) techniques for real-time rendering and related perceptual issues have received a lot of attention in recent years. Researchers have also begun to look at the issue of perceptually adaptive techniques for plausible physical simulations. In this article, we are particularly interested in the problem of realistic collision simulation in scenes where large numbers of objects are colliding and processing must occur in real-time. An interruptible and therefore degradable collision-handling mechanism is used and the perceptual impact of this degradation is explored. We look for ways in which we can optimize the realism of such simulations and describe a series of psychophysical experiments that investigate different factors affecting collision perception, including eccentricity, separation, distractors, causality, and accuracy of physical response. Finally, strategies for incorporating these factors into a perceptually adaptive real-time simulation of large numbers of visually similar objects are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15198","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15198","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15199","fieldValue":"Paul, J-C"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15199","fieldValue":" In this article, we introduce a general-purpose method for computing radiosity on scenes made of parametric surfaces with arbitrary trimming curves. In contrast with past approaches that require a tessellation of the input surfaces (be it made up of triangles or patches with simple trimming curves) or some form of geometric approximation, our method takes full advantage of the rich and compact mathematical representation of objects. At its core lies the virtual mesh, an abstraction of the input geometry that allows complex shapes to be illuminated as if they were simple primitives. The virtual mesh is a collection of normalized square domains to which the input surfaces are mapped while preserving their energy properties. Radiosity values are then computed on these supports before being lifted back to the original surfaces. To demonstrate the power of our method, we describe a high-order wavelet radiosity implementation that uses the virtual mesh. Examples of objects and environments, designed for interactive applications or virtual reality, are presented. They prove that, by exactly integrating curved surfaces in the resolution process, the virtual mesh allows complex scenes to be rendered more quickly, more accurately, and much more naturally than with previously known methods."}
