This study has two core objectives. First, we investigate more robust back-ends to address noisy multi-session enrollment data for speaker recognition. This task is achieved by proposing novel back-end algorithms. Second, we construct a highly discriminative speaker verification framework. This task is achieved through intrinsic and extrinsic back-end algorithm modification, resulting in complementary sub-systems. Evaluation of the proposed framework is performed on the NIST SRE2012 corpus. Results not only confirm individual sub-system advancements over an established baseline, the final grand fusion solution also represents a comprehensive overall advancement for the NIST SRE2012 core tasks. Compared with state-of-the-art SID systems on the NIST SRE2012, the novel parts of this study are: 1) exploring a more diverse set of solutions for low-dimensional i-Vector based modeling; and 2) diversifying the information configuration before modeling. All these two parts work together, resulting in very competitive performance with reasonable computational cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3737","fieldValue":"GCDS"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3737","fieldValue":"PLDA"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3737","fieldValue":"An investigation into back-end advancements for speaker recognition in multi-session and noisy enrollment scenarios"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3738","fieldValue":"Wang, DeLiang"}
