Monte Carlo integration with importance sampling is used to carry out this calculation. Importance sampling involves the design of integrand-specific probability density functions that are used to generate sample points for the numerical quadrature. Probability density functions are presented that aid in the direct lighting calculation from luminaires of various simple shapes. A method for defining a probability density function over a set of luminaires is presented that allows the direct lighting calculation to be carried out with a number of sample points that is independent of the number of luminaires."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15127","fieldValue":"DeRose, Tony D."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15127","fieldValue":" We show how importance-driven refinement and a wavelet basis can be combined to provide an efficient solution to the global illumination problem with glossy and diffuse reflections. Importance is used to focus the computation on the interactions having the greatest impact on the visible solution. Wavelets are used to provide an efficient representation of radiance, importance, and the transport operator. We discuss a number of choices that must be made when constructing a finite element algorithm for glossy global illumination. Our algorithm is based on the standard wavelet decomposition of the transport operator and makes use of a four-dimensional wavelet representation for spatially and angularly varying radiance distributions. We use a final gathering step to improve the visual quality of the solution. Features of our implementation include support for curved surfaces as well as texture-mapped anisotropic emission and reflection functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15127","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15127","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15128","fieldValue":"van Overveld, C.

These topological relations include incidence relations, constraining the extremes of spline curves to other spline curves, and also more general geometric relations, for example, involving the tangents of spline curves in their extremes. To maintain these incidence relations, some spline curves may have to be transformed (translated, rotated, scaled), or even deformed (i.e., the shape of the curve may change) as a result of modifying other spline curves. A data structure and algorithms are given to implement the propagation of these transformations and deformations.Based on the augmented spline concept, to be called sticky splines, both a script system to represent spline structures and an interactive system for editing drawings while automatically, maintaining their topological structure are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15128","fieldValue":"Sticky splines: definition and manipulation of spline structures with maintained topological relations"}
