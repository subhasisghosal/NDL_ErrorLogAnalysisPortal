Proper characterization of system stability helps to understand biological functions and has potential applications in fields such as synthetic biology. Existing methods of analyzing bistability are either qualitative or in a static way. Assuming the circuit is in a steady state, the latter can only reveal the susceptibility of the stability to injected DC noises. However, this can be inappropriate and inadequate as dynamics are crucial for many biological networks. In this paper, we quantitatively characterize the dynamic stability of a genetic conditional memory circuit by developing new dynamic noise margin (DNM) concepts and associated algorithms based on system theory. Taking into account the duration of the noisy perturbation, the DNMs are more general cases of their static counterparts. Using our techniques, we analyze the noise immunity of the memory circuit and derive insights on dynamic hold and write operations. Considering cell-to-cell variations, our parametric analysis reveals that the dynamic stability of the memory circuit has significantly varying sensitivities to underlying biochemical reactions attributable to differences in structure, time scales, and nonlinear interactions between reactions. With proper extensions, our techniques are broadly applicable to other multistable biological systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4769","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4769","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4769","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4770","fieldValue":"Back, Ralph-Johan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4770","fieldValue":" In vitro assembly of intermediate filaments from tetrameric vimentin consists of a very rapid phase of tetramers laterally associating into unit-length filaments and a slow phase of filament elongation. We focus in this paper on a systematic quantitative investigation of two molecular models for filament assembly, recently proposed in (Kirmse et al. J. Biol. Chem. 282, 52 (2007), 18563-18572), through mathematical modeling, model fitting, and model validation. We analyze the quantitative contribution of each filament elongation strategy: with tetramers, with unit-length filaments, with longer filaments, or combinations thereof. In each case, we discuss the numerical fitting of the model with respect to one set of data, and its separate validation with respect to a second, different set of data. We introduce a high-resolution model for vimentin filament self-assembly, able to capture the detailed dynamics of filaments of arbitrary length. This provides much more predictive power for the model, in comparison to previous models where only the mean length of all filaments in the solution could be analyzed. We show how kinetic observations on low-resolution models can be extrapolated to the high-resolution model and used for lowering its complexity."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4770","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4770","fieldValue":"Mathematical modeling, protein self-assembly, quantitative self-assembly strategies, model resolution, sensitivity analysis, filament length distribution."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4770","fieldValue":"Quantitative Analysis of the Self-Assembly Strategies of Intermediate Filaments from Tetrameric Vimentin"}
