A number of computer algorithms have been developed for this task. Although these algorithms have demonstrated their usefulness for gene clustering, some basic problems remain. This paper describes our work on extracting functional keywords from MEDLINE for a set of genes that are isolated for further study from microarray experiments based on their differential expression patterns. The sharing of functional keywords among genes is used as a basis for clustering in a new approach called BEA-PARTITION in this paper. Functional keywords associated with genes were extracted from MEDLINE abstracts. We modified the Bond Energy Algorithm (BEA), which is widely accepted in psychology and database design but is virtually unknown in bioinformatics, to cluster genes by functional keyword associations. The results showed that BEA-PARTITION and hierarchical clustering algorithm outperformed k\\hbox{-}{\\rm{means}} clustering and self-organizing map by correctly assigning 25 of 26 genes in a test set of four known gene groups. To evaluate the effectiveness of BEA-PARTITION for clustering genes identified by microarray profiles, 44 yeast genes that are differentially expressed during the cell cycle and have been widely studied in the literature were used as a second test set. Using established measures of cluster quality, the results produced by BEA-PARTITION had higher purity, lower entropy, and higher mutual information than those produced by k\\hbox{-}{\\rm{means}} and self-organizing map. Whereas BEA-PARTITION and the hierarchical clustering produced similar quality of clusters, BEA-PARTITION provides clear cluster boundaries compared to the hierarchical clustering. BEA-PARTITION is simple to implement and provides a powerful approach to clustering genes or to any clustering problem where starting matrices are available from experimental observations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4193","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4193","fieldValue":"Index Terms- Bond energy algorithm, microarray, MEDLINE, text analysis, cluster analysis, gene function."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4193","fieldValue":"Text Mining Biomedical Literature for Discovering Gene-to-Gene Relationships: A Comparative Study of Algorithms"}
