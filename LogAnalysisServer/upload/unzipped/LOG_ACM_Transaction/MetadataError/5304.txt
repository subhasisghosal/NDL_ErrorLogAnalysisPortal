{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4395","fieldValue":" Several methods have been developed for simultaneous estimation of alignment and tree, of which POY is the most popular. In a 2007 paper published in Systematic Biology, Ogden and Rosenberg reported on a simulation study in which they compared POY to estimating the alignment using ClustalW and then analyzing the resultant alignment using maximum parsimony. They found that ClustalW+MP outperformed POY with respect to alignment and phylogenetic tree accuracy, and they concluded that simultaneous estimation techniques are not competitive with two-phase techniques. Our paper presents a simulation study in which we focus on the NP-hard optimization problem that POY addresses: minimizing treelength. Our study considers the impact of the gap penalty and suggests that the poor performance observed for POY by Ogden and Rosenberg is due to the simple gap penalties they used to score alignment\/tree pairs. Our study suggests that optimizing under an affine gap penalty might produce alignments that are better than ClustalW alignments, and competitive with those produced by the best current alignment methods. We also show that optimizing under this affine gap penalty produces trees whose topological accuracy is better than ClustalW+MP, and competitive with the current best two-phase methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4395","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4396","fieldValue":"von Haeseler, Arndt"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4396","fieldValue":" In the last 15 years, Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) has gained interest in the community of conservation biologists as a surrogate measure for assessing biodiversity. We have recently proposed two approaches to select taxa for maximizing PD, namely PD with budget constraints and PD on split systems. In this paper, we will unify these two strategies and present a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the unified framework of selecting taxa with maximal PD under budget constraints on circular split systems. An improved algorithm will also be given if the underlying split system is a tree."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4396","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4396","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4396","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4397","fieldValue":" Reticulate evolutionâ\u20AC\u201Dthe umbrella term for processes like hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, and recombinationâ\u20AC\u201Dplays an important role in the history of life of many species. Although the occurrence of such events is widely accepted, approaches to calculate the extent to which reticulation has influenced evolution are relatively rare. In this paper, we show that the NP-hard problem of calculating the minimum number of reticulation events for two (arbitrary) rooted phylogenetic trees parameterized by this minimum number is fixed-parameter tractable."}
