Sensitivity analysis allows the decision maker to identify those requirements and budgets that are particularly sensitive to misestimation. However, finding scalable sensitivity analysis techniques is not easy because the underlying optimization problem is NP-hard. This article introduces an approach to sensitivity analysis based on exact optimization. We implemented this approach as a tool, OATSAC, which allowed us to experimentally evaluate the scalability and applicability of Requirements Sensitivity Analysis (RSA). Our results show that OATSAC scales sufficiently well for practical applications in Requirements Sensitivity Analysis. We also show how the sensitivity analysis can yield insights into difficult and otherwise obscure interactions between budgets, requirements costs, and estimate inaccuracies using a real-world case study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22901","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22901","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22902","fieldValue":"Pombo, Carlos G Lopez"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22902","fieldValue":"Frias, Marcelo F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22902","fieldValue":" Automatic analysis of Alloy models is supported by the Alloy Analyzer, a tool that translates an Alloy model to a propositional formula that is then analyzed using off-the-shelf SAT solvers. The translation requires user-provided bounds on the sizes of data domains. The analysis is limited by the bounds and is therefore partial. Thus, the Alloy Analyzer may not be appropriate for the analysis of critical applications where more conclusive results are necessary. Dynamite is an extension of PVS that embeds a complete calculus for Alloy. It also includes extensions to PVS that allow one to improve the proof effort by, for instance, automatically analyzing new hypotheses with the aid of the Alloy Analyzer. Since PVS sequents may get cluttered with unnecessary formulas, we use the Alloy unsat-core extraction feature in order to refine proof sequents. An internalization of Alloy's syntax as an Alloy specification allows us to use the Alloy Analyzer for producing witnesses for proving existentially quantified formulas. Dynamite complements the partial automatic analysis offered by the Alloy Analyzer with semi-automatic verification through theorem proving. It also improves the theorem proving experience by using the Alloy Analyzer for early error detection, sequent refinement, and witness generation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22902","fieldValue":"PVS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22902","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22902","fieldValue":"ACM"}
