The theory $S^12 proves the scheme BB(Î£b1), and thus in S12 every Î£b1 formula is equivalent to a strict Î£b1 formula (in which all non-sharply-bounded quantifiers are in front). Here we prove (sometimes subject to an assumption) that certain theories weaker than S12 do not prove either BB(Î£b1) or BB(Î£b0). We show (unconditionally) that V 0 does not prove BB(Î£b0), where V0 (essentially IÎ£1,b0) is the two-sorted theory associated with the complexity class AC0. We show that PV does not prove BB(Î£b0), assuming that integer factoring is not possible in probabilistic polynomial time. Johannsen and Pollett introduced the theory C02 associated with the complexity class TC0, and later introduced an apparently weaker theory Î\u201Db1 âˆ\u2019 CR for the same class. We use our methods to show that Î\u201Db1 âˆ\u2019 CR is indeed weaker than C0$2$, assuming that RSA is secure against probabilistic polynomial time attack.Our main tool is the KPT witnessing theorem."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11478","fieldValue":"PV"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11478","fieldValue":"PV"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11479","fieldValue":" It is well known that, under certain conditions, it is possible to split logic programs under stable model semantics, that is, to divide such a program into a number of different â\u20ACœlevelsâ\u20AC?, such that the models of the entire program can be constructed by incrementally constructing models for each level. Similar results exist for other nonmonotonic formalisms, such as auto-epistemic logic and default logic. In this work, we present a general, algebraic splitting theory for logics with a fixpoint semantics. Together with the framework of approximation theory, a general fixpoint theory for arbitrary operators, this gives us a uniform and powerful way of deriving splitting results for each logic with a fixpoint semantics. We demonstrate the usefulness of these results, by generalizing existing results for logic programming, auto-epistemic logic and default logic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11480","fieldValue":" We propose Kleene algebra with domain (KAD), an extension of Kleene algebra by simple equational axioms for a domain and a codomain operation. KAD considerably augments the expressiveness of Kleene algebra, in particular for the specification and analysis of programs and state transition systems. We develop the basic calculus, present the most interesting models and discuss some related theories. We demonstrate applicability by two examples: algebraic reconstructions of Noethericity and propositional Hoare logic based on equational reasoning."}
