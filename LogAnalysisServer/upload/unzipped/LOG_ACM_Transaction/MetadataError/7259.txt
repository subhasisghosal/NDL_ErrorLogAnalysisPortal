The focus is on understanding which traffic parameters are responsible for inducing possible deviations and to what extent. In addition, we seek to evaluate the level of additional resources, e.g., bandwidth or buffer, required to ensure that all individual loss measures remain below their desired target. This paper's contributions are in developing analytical models that enable the evaluation of individual loss probabilities in settings where only aggregate losses are controlled, and in identifying traffic parameters that have a major influence on the differences between individual and aggregate losses. The latter allows us to further construct practical tools and guidelines for rapidly assessing if specific traffic sources can be safely multiplexed into a common service class."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9336","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9337","fieldValue":" In the near future, small intelligent devices will be deployed in homes, plantations, oceans, rivers, streets, and highways to monitor the environment. These devices require time synchronization, so voice and video data from different sensor nodes can be fused and displayed in a meaningful way at the sink. Instead of time synchronization between just the sender and receiver or within a local group of sensor nodes, some applications require the sensor nodes to maintain a similar time within a certain tolerance throughout the lifetime of the network. The Time-Diffusion Synchronization Protocol (TDP) is proposed as a network-wide time synchronization protocol. It allows the sensor network to reach an equilibrium time and maintains a small time deviation tolerance from the equilibrium time. In addition, it is analytically shown that the TDP enables time in the network to converge. Also, simulations are performed to validate the effectiveness of TDP in synchronizing the time throughout the network and balancing the energy consumed by the sensor nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9337","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1842","fieldValue":" Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs) are critical to overall system performance. Much past research has addressed uniprocessor TLBs, lowering access times and miss rates. However, as Chip MultiProcessors (CMPs) become ubiquitous, TLB design and performance must be reevaluated. Our article begins by performing a thorough TLB performance evaluation of sequential and parallel benchmarks running on a real-world, modern CMP system using hardware performance counters. This analysis demonstrates the need for further improvement of TLB hit rates for both classes of application, and it also points out that the data TLB has a significantly higher miss rate than the instruction TLB in both cases. In response to the characterization data, we propose and evaluate both Inter-Core Cooperative (ICC) TLB prefetchers and Shared Last-Level (SLL) TLBs as alternatives to the commercial norm of private, per-core L2 TLBs. ICC prefetchers eliminate 19&percnt; to 90&percnt; of Data TLB (D-TLB) misses across parallel workloads while requiring only modest changes in hardware. SLL TLBs eliminate 7&percnt; to 79&percnt; of D-TLB misses for parallel workloads and 35&percnt; to 95&percnt; of D-TLB misses for multiprogrammed sequential workloads. This corresponds to 27&percnt; and 21&percnt; increases in hit rates as compared to private, per-core L2 TLBs, respectively, and is achieved this using even more modest hardware requirements. Because of their benefits for parallel applications, their applicability to sequential workloads, and their readily implementable hardware, SLL TLBs and ICC TLB prefetchers hold great promise for CMPs."}
