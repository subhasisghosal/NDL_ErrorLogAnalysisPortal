{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15337","fieldValue":" We develop a novel method for fitting high-resolution template meshes to detailed human body range scans with sparse 3D markers. We formulate an optimization problem in which the degrees of freedom are an affine transformation at each template vertex. The objective function is a weighted combination of three measures: proximity of transformed vertices to the range data, similarity between neighboring transformations, and proximity of sparse markers at corresponding locations on the template and target surface. We solve for the transformations with a non-linear optimizer, run at two resolutions to speed convergence. We demonstrate reconstruction and consistent parameterization of 250 human body models. With this parameterized set, we explore a variety of applications for human body modeling, including: morphing, texture transfer, statistical analysis of shape, model fitting from sparse markers, feature analysis to modify multiple correlated parameters (such as the weight and height of an individual), and transfer of surface detail and animation controls from a template to fitted models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15338","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15338","fieldValue":" From-region visibility culling is considered harder than from-point visibility culling, since it is inherently four-dimensional. We present a conservative occlusion culling method based on factorizing the 4D visibility problem into horizontal and vertical components. The visibility of the two components is solved asymmetrically: the horizontal component is based on a parameterization of the ray space, and the visibility of the vertical component is solved by incrementally merging umbrae. The technique is designed so that the horizontal and vertical operations can be efficiently realized together by modern graphics hardware. Similar to image-based from-point methods, we use an occlusion map to encode visibility; however, the image-space occlusion map is in the ray space rather than in the primal space. Our results show that the culling time and the size of the computed potentially visible set depend on the size of the viewcell. For moderate viewcells, conservative occlusion culling of large urban scenes takes less than a second, and the size of the potentially visible set is only about two times larger than the size of the exact visible set."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15338","fieldValue":"PVS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2453","fieldValue":" We study a bichromatic version of the well-known k-set problem: given two sets R and B of points of total size n and an integer k, how many subsets of the form (Râˆ© h) âˆª (B&setmn; h) can have size exactly k over all halfspaces h&quest; In the dual, the problem is asymptotically equivalent to determining the worst-case combinatorial complexity of the k-level in an arrangement of n halfspaces.
