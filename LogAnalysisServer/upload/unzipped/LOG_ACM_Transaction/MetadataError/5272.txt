The main idea behind the proposed approach consists of estimating how the information content shared by a set of M nodes in a network (where each node is associated to an expression profile) varies upon conditioning on a set of L conditioning variables (in the simplest case represented by a separate set of expression profiles). The method is non-parametric and it is based on the concept of statistical co-information, which, unlike conventional correlation based techniques, is not restricted in scope to linear conditional dependency patterns. Moreover, such conditional co-expression relationships can potentially indicate regulatory interactions that do not manifest themselves when only pair-wise relationships are considered. A moment based approximation of the co-information measure is derived that efficiently gets around the problem of estimating high-dimensional multi-variate probability density functions from the data, a task usually not viable due to the intrinsic sample size limitations that characterize expression level measurements. By applying the proposed exploratory method, we analyzed a whole genome microarray assay of the eukaryote Saccharomices cerevisiae and were able to learn statistically significant patterns of conditional co-expression. A selection of such interactions that carry a meaningful biological interpretation are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4334","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4334","fieldValue":"An Information Theoretic Exploratory Method for Learning Patterns of Conditional Gene Coexpression from Microarray Data"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4334","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4334","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4335","fieldValue":" This paper presents two in-depth studies on RnaPredict, an evolutionary algorithm for RNA secondary structure prediction. The first study is an analysis of the performance of two thermodynamic models, INN and INN-HB. The correlation between the free energy of predicted structures and the sensitivity is analyzed for 19 RNA sequences. Although some variance is shown, there is a clear trend between a lower free energy and an increase in true positive base pairs. With increasing sequence length, this correlation generally decreases. In the second experiment, the accuracy of the predicted structures for these 19 sequences are compared against the accuracy of the structures generated by the mfold dynamic programming algorithm (DPA) and also to known structures. RnaPredict is shown to outperform the minimum free energy structures produced by mfold and has comparable performance when compared to sub-optimal structures produced by mfold."}
