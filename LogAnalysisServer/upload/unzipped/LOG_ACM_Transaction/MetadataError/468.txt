{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12480","fieldValue":" We study constraint satisfaction problems on the domain {âˆ\u20191, 1}, where the given constraints are homogeneous linear threshold predicates, that is, predicates of the form $sgn(w1x_1 + &ctdot; + wnxn) for some positive integer weights w1, ..., wn. Despite their simplicity, current techniques fall short of providing a classification of these predicates in terms of approximability. In fact, it is not easy to guess whether there exists a homogeneous linear threshold predicate that is approximation resistant or not. The focus of this article is to identify and study the approximation curve of a class of threshold predicates that allow for nontrivial approximation. Arguably the simplest such predicate is the majority predicate sgn(x1 + &ctdot; + xn$), for which we obtain an almost complete understanding of the asymptotic approximation curve, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. Our techniques extend to a more general class of â\u20ACœmajority-likeâ\u20AC? predicates and we obtain parallel results for them. In order to classify these predicates, we introduce the notion of Chow-robustness that might be of independent interest."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12480","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12480","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12481","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of extracting randomness from sources that are efficiently samplable, in the sense that each output bit of the sampler only depends on some small number d of the random input bits. As our main result, we construct a deterministic extractor that, given any d-local source with min-entropy k on n bits, extracts $Î©(k^2\/nd) bits that are 2âˆ\u2019nÎ©(1)-close to uniform, provided d â\u2030¤ o(log n) and k â\u2030¥ n2\/3+Î³ (for arbitrarily small constants Î³ > 0). Using our result, we also improve a result of Viola [2010] who proved a 1\/2 âˆ\u2019 O(1\/log n) statistical distance lower bound for o(log n)-local samplers trying to sample input-output pairs of an explicit boolean function, assuming the samplers use at most n + n1âˆ\u2019Î\u201D random bits for some constant Î\u201D > 0. Using a different function, we simultaneously improve the lower bound to 1\/2 âˆ\u2019 2âˆ\u2019nÎ©(1)$ and eliminate the restriction on the number of random bits."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12481","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12481","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12482","fieldValue":"Schoenebeck, Grant R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12482","fieldValue":" Games may be represented in many different ways, and different representations of games affect the complexity of problems associated with games, such as finding a Nash equilibrium. The traditional method of representing a game is to explicitly list all the payoffs, but this incurs an exponential blowup as the number of agents grows. We study two models of concisely represented games: circuit games, where the payoffs are computed by a given boolean circuit, and graph games, where each agentâ\u20AC™s payoff is a function of only the strategies played by its neighbors in a given graph. For these two models, we study the complexity of four questions: determining if a given strategy is a Nash equilibrium, finding a Nash equilibrium, determining if there exists a pure Nash equilibrium, and determining if there exists a Nash equilibrium in which the payoffs to a player meet some given guarantees. In many cases, we obtain tight results, showing that the problems are complete for various complexity classes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12482","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12482","fieldValue":"ACM"}
