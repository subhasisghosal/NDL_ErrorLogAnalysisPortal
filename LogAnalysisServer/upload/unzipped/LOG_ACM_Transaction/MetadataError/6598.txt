We have designed a method targeting the detection of both steganography and seam-carved forgery in JPEG images. We analyze the neighboring joint density of the DCT coefficients and reveal the difference between the untouched image and the modified version. In realistic detection, the untouched image and the modified version may not be obtained at the same time, and different JPEG images may have different neighboring joint density features. By exploring the self-calibration under different shift recompressions, we propose calibrated neighboring joint density-based approaches with a simple feature set to distinguish steganograms and tampered images from untouched ones. Our study shows that this approach has multiple promising applications in image forensics. Compared to the state-of-the-art steganalysis detectors, our approach delivers better or comparable detection performances with a much smaller feature set while detecting several JPEG-based steganographic systems including DCT-embedding-based adaptive steganography and Yet Another Steganographic Scheme (YASS). Our approach is also effective in detecting seam-carved forgery in JPEG images. By integrating calibrated neighboring density with spatial domain rich models that were originally designed for steganalysis, the hybrid approach obtains the best detection accuracy to discriminate seam-carved forgery from an untouched image. Our study also offers a promising manner to explore steganalysis and forgery detection together."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7577","fieldValue":"JPEG"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7577","fieldValue":"YASS"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7577","fieldValue":"Improved Approaches with Calibrated Neighboring Joint Density to Steganalysis and Seam-Carved Forgery Detection in JPEG Images"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7577","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7577","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7578","fieldValue":"Goldman, Claudia V"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7578","fieldValue":" In this article, we study automated agents that are designed to encourage humans to take some actions over others by strategically disclosing key pieces of information. To this end, we utilize the framework of persuasion gamesâ\u20AC\u201Da branch of game theory that deals with asymmetric interactions where one player (Sender) possesses more information about the world, but it is only the other player (Receiver) who can take an action. In particular, we use an extended persuasion model, where the Senderâ\u20AC™s information is imperfect and the Receiver has more than two alternative actions available. We design a computational algorithm that, from the Senderâ\u20AC™s standpoint, calculates the optimal information disclosure rule. The algorithm is parameterized by the Receiverâ\u20AC™s decision model (i.e., what choice he will make based on the information disclosed by the Sender) and can be retuned accordingly. We then provide an extensive experimental study of the algorithmâ\u20AC™s performance in interactions with human Receivers. First, we consider a fully rational (in the Bayesian sense) Receiver decision model and experimentally show the efficacy of the resulting Senderâ\u20AC™s solution in a routing domain. Despite the discrepancy in the Senderâ\u20AC™s and the Receiverâ\u20AC™s utilities from each of the Receiverâ\u20AC™s choices, our Sender agent successfully persê·­ human Receivers to select an option more beneficial for the agent. Dropping the Receiverâ\u20AC™s rationality assumption, we introduce a machine learning procedure that generates a more realistic human Receiver model. We then show its significant benefit to the Sender solution by repeating our routing experiment. To complete our study, we introduce a second (supply--demand) experimental domain and, by contrasting it with the routing domain, obtain general guidelines for a Sender on how to construct a Receiver model."}
