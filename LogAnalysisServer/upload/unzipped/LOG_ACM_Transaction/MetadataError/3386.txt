{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3014","fieldValue":" Since the problem of textual entailment recognition requires capturing semantic relations between diverse expressions of language, linguistic and world knowledge play an important role. In this article, we explore the effectiveness of different types of currently available resources including synonyms, antonyms, hypernym-hyponym relations, and lexical entailment relations for the task of textual entailment recognition. In order to do so, we develop an entailment relation recognition system which utilizes diverse linguistic analyses and resources to align the linguistic units in a pair of texts and identifies entailment relations based on these alignments. We use the Japanese subset of the NTCIR-9 RITE-1 dataset for evaluation and error analysis, conducting ablation testing and evaluation on hand-crafted alignment gold standard data to evaluate the contribution of individual resources. Error analysis shows that existing knowledge sources are effective for RTE, but that their coverage is limited, especially for domain-specific and other low-frequency expressions. To increase alignment coverage on such expressions, we propose a method of alignment inference that uses syntactic and semantic dependency information to identify likely alignments without relying on external resources. Evaluation adding alignment inference to a system using all available knowledge sources shows improvements in both precision and recall of entailment relation recognition."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21075","fieldValue":"Chen, Tseng-Yi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21075","fieldValue":"Wei, Hsin-Wen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21075","fieldValue":"Yeh, Tsung-Tai"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21075","fieldValue":"Hsu, Tsan-Sheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21075","fieldValue":"Shih, Wei-Kuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21075","fieldValue":" Previous studies proposed energy-efficient solutions, such as multispeed disks and disk spin-down methods, to conserve power in their respective storage systems. However, in most cases, the authors did not analyze the reliability of their solutions. According to research conducted by Google and the IDEMA standard, frequently setting the disk status to standby mode will increase the diskâ\u20AC™s Annual Failure Rate and reduce its lifespan. To resolve the issue, we propose an evaluation function called $E^3SaRC (Economic Evaluation of Energy Saving with Reliability Constraint), which considers the cost of hardware failure when applying energy-saving schemes. We also present an adaptive write cache mechanism called CacheRAID. The mechanism tries to mitigate the random access problems that implicitly exist in RAID techniques and thereby reduce the energy consumption of RAID disks. CacheRAID also addresses the issue of system reliability by applying a control mechanism to the spin-down algorithm. Our experimental results show that the CacheRAID storage system can reduce the power consumption of the conventional software RAID 5 system by 65&percnt; to 80&percnt;. Moreover, according to the E3$SaRC measurement, the overall saved cost of CacheRAID is the largest among the systems that we compared."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21075","fieldValue":"RAID"}
