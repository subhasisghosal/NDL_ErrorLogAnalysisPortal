Consequently, redundant sensor nodes that are not currently needed in the covering task can be powered off to conserve energy. These sensors can take over the covering task later to prolong network lifetime. The coverage problem, concerns picking up a set of working sensors that collectively meet the coverage requirements. The problem is complicated by the possibility that targets may have different coverage requirements while sensor nodes may have different amounts of energy. This article proposes a game-theoretic approach to the coverage problem, where each sensor autonomously decides its state with a simple rule based on local information. We give rigorous proofs to show stability, correctness, and efficiency of the proposed game. Implementation variants of the game consider specific issues, such as game convergence time and different amounts of sensor energy. Simulation results show significant improvement in network lifetime by the proposed approach when compared with representative alternatives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3043","fieldValue":"Lee, Jong-Hyeok"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3043","fieldValue":" The Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) constraints have been widely used for word reordering in machine translation studies. They are, however, so restricted that some types of word reordering cannot be handled properly. We analyze three corpora between SVO and SOV languages: Chinese-Korean, English-Japanese, and English-Korean. In our analysis, sentences that require non-ITG word reordering are manually categorized. We also report the results for two quantitative measures that reveal the significance of non-ITG word reordering. In conclusion, we suggest that ITG constraints are insufficient to deal with word reordering in real situations."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3043","fieldValue":"Linguistic analysis of non-ITG word reordering between language pairs with different word order typologies"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21443","fieldValue":"Uluagac, A Selcuk"}
