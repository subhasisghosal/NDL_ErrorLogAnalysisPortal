Genetic variations, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms, are used to characterize commonality and difference of individuals from various populations. This paper presents an efficient graph-based clustering framework which operates iteratively on the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree called the iNJclust algorithm. The framework uses well-known genetic measurements, namely the allele-sharing distance, the neighbor-joining tree, and the fixation index. The behavior of the fixation index is utilized in the algorithm's stopping criterion. The algorithm provides an estimated number of populations, individual assignments, and relationships between populations as outputs. The clustering result is reported in the form of a binary tree, whose terminal nodes represent the final inferred populations and the tree structure preserves the genetic relationships among them. The clustering performance and the robustness of the proposed algorithm are tested extensively using simulated and real data sets from bovine, sheep, and human populations. The result indicates that the number of populations within each data set is reasonably estimated, the individual assignment is robust, and the structure of the inferred population tree corresponds to the intrinsic relationships among populations within the data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5097","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5097","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5097","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5098","fieldValue":" Phosphorylation motifs represent position-specific amino acid patterns around the phosphorylation sites in the set of phosphopeptides. Several algorithms have been proposed to uncover phosphorylation motifs, whereas the problem of efficiently discovering a set of significant motifs with sufficiently high coverage and non-redundancy still remains unsolved. Here we present a novel notion called conditional phosphorylation motifs. Through this new concept, the motifs whose over-expressiveness mainly benefits from its constituting parts can be filtered out effectively. To discover conditional phosphorylation motifs, we propose an algorithm called C-Motif for a non-redundant identification of significant phosphorylation motifs. C-Motif is implemented under the Apriori framework, and it tests the statistical significance together with the frequency of candidate motifs in a single stage. Experiments demonstrate that C-Motif outperforms some current algorithms such as MMFPh and Motif-All in terms of coverage and non-redundancy of the results and efficiency of the execution. The source code of C-Motif is available at: https:\/\/sourceforge. net\/projects\/cmotif\/."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5098","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5098","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5098","fieldValue":"ACM"}
