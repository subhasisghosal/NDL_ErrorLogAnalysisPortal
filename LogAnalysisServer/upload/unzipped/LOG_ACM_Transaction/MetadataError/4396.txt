Hence, the search engine query log, which serves as the backbone of many search engine applications, records millions of usersâ\u20AC™ search history in a wide spectrum of human languages and demonstrates a strong multilingual phenomenon. However, with its salience, the multilingual nature of a search engine query log is usually ignored by existing works, which usually consider query log entries of different languages as being orthogonal and independent. This kind of oversimplified assumption heavily distorts the underlying structure of web search data. In this article, we pioneer in recognition of the multilingual nature of a query log and make the first attempt to cross the language barrier in query logs. We propose a novel model named Cross-Lingual Query Log Topic Model (CL-QLTM) to analyze query logs from a cross-lingual perspective and derive the latent topics of web search data. The CL-QLTM comprehensively integrates web search data in different languages by collectively utilizing cross-lingual dictionaries, as well as the co-occurrence relations in the query log. In order to relieve the efficiency bottleneck of applying the CL-QLTM on voluminous query logs, we propose an efficient parameter inference algorithm based on the MapReduce computing paradigm. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that the CL-QLTM is able to effectively derive cross-lingual topics from multilingual query logs and spawn a wide spectrum of new search engine applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24168","fieldValue":"Liu, Tie-Yan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24168","fieldValue":" Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most effective techniques in recommender systems, which can be either rating oriented or ranking oriented. Ranking-oriented CF algorithms demonstrated significant performance gains in terms of ranking accuracy, being able to estimate a precise preference ranking of items for each user rather than the absolute ratings (as rating-oriented CF algorithms do). Conventional memory-based ranking-oriented CF can be referred to as pairwise algorithms. They represent each user as a set of preferences on each pair of items for similarity calculations and predictions. In this study, we propose ListCF, a novel listwise CF paradigm that seeks improvement in both accuracy and efficiency in comparison with pairwise CF. In ListCF, each user is represented as a probability distribution of the permutations over rated items based on the Plackett-Luce model, and the similarity between users is measured based on the Kullback--Leibler divergence between their probability distributions over the set of commonly rated items. Given a target user and the most similar users, ListCF directly predicts a total order of items for each user based on similar usersâ\u20AC™ probability distributions over permutations of the items. Besides, we also reveal insightful connections among pointwise, pairwise, and listwise CF algorithms from the perspective of the matrix representations. In addition, to make our algorithm more scalable and adaptive, we present an incremental algorithm for ListCF, which allows incrementally updating the similarities between users when certain user submits a new rating or updates an existing rating. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the promise of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/24168","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China (Liu, Tie-Yan); University of Jyvaskyla, Jyv&#228;skyl&#228;, Finland (Wang, Shuaiqiang; Veijalainen, Jari); Shandong University, Jinan, China (Ma, Jun; Chen, Zhumin); Shandong University (Huang, Shanshan)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24168","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24168","fieldValue":"ACM"}
