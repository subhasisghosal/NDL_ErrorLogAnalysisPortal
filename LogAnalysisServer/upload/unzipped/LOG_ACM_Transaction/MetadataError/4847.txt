{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25558","fieldValue":" This article defines a new hashing task motivated by real-world applications in content-based image retrieval, that is, effective data indexing and retrieval given mixed query (query image together with user-provided keywords). Our work is distinguished from state-of-the-art hashing research by two unique features: (1) Unlike conventional image retrieval systems, the input query is a combination of an exemplar image and several descriptive keywords, and (2) the input image data are often associated with multiple labels. It is an assumption that is more consistent with the realistic scenarios. The mixed image-keyword query significantly extends traditional image-based query and better explicates the user intention. Meanwhile it complicates semantics-based indexing on the multilabel data. Though several existing hashing methods can be adapted to solve the indexing task, unfortunately they all prove to suffer from low effectiveness. To enhance the hashing efficiency, we propose a novel scheme â\u20ACœboosted shared hashingâ\u20AC?. Unlike prior works that learn the hashing functions on either all image labels or a single label, we observe that the hashing function can be more effective if it is designed to index over an optimal label subset. In other words, the association between labels and hash bits are moderately sparse. The sparsity of the bit-label association indicates greatly reduced computation and storage complexities for indexing a new sample, since only limited number of hashing functions will become active for the specific sample. We develop a Boosting style algorithm for simultaneously optimizing both the optimal label subsets and hashing functions in a unified formulation, and further propose a query-adaptive retrieval mechanism based on hash bit selection for mixed queries, no matter whether or not the query words exist in the training data. Moreover, we show that the proposed method can be easily extended to the case where the data similarity is gauged by nonlinear kernel functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on standard image benchmarks like CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and a-TRECVID. The results validate both the sparsity of the bit-label association and the convergence of the proposed algorithm, and demonstrate that the proposed hashing scheme achieves substantially superior performances over state-of-the-art methods under the same hash bit budget."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25558","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25558","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25559","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25559","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25560","fieldValue":"Chan, S-H Gary"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25560","fieldValue":" IPTV services deployed nowadays often consist of both live TV and Video-on-Demand (VoD), offered by the same service provider to the same pool of users over the same managed network. Understanding user behaviors in such a setting is hence an important step for system modelling and optimization. Previous studies on user behavior on video services were on either live TV or VoD. For the first time, we conduct an in-depth large-scale behavior study for IPTV users offering simultaneously live TV and VoD choices at the same time. Our data is from the largest IPTV service provider in China, offering hundreds of live channels and hundreds of thousands of VoD files, with traces covering more than 1.9 million users over a period of 5 months. This large dataset provides us a unique opportunity to cross-compare user viewing behaviors for these services on the same platform, and sheds valuable insights on how users interact with such a simultaneous system. Our results lead to new understanding on IPTV user behaviors which have strong implications on system design. For example, we find that the average holding time for VoD is significantly longer than live TV. live TV users tend to surf more. However, if such channel surfing is discounted, the holding times of both services are not much different. While users in VoD tend to view HD longer, channel popularity for live TV is much less dependent on its video quality. In contrast to some popular assumptions on user interactivity, the transitions among live TV, VoD, and offline modes are far from a Markov model."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25560","fieldValue":"IPTV"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25560","fieldValue":"ACM"}
