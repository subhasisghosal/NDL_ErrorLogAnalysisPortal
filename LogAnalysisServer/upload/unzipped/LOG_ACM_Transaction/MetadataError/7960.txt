This optimization problem is nonconvex, but in this paper we show that, under reasonable conditions, it can be reformulated as a convex optimization. Using this insight, we develop a lightweight method for finding the optimal antenna tilt angles, making use of measurements that are already available at base stations, and suited to distributed implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10737","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10738","fieldValue":" We present a comprehensive delay performance measurement and analysis in a large-scale wireless sensor network. We build a lightweight delay measurement system and present a robust method to calculate the per-packet delay. We show that the method can identify incorrect delays and recover them with a bounded error. Through analysis of delay and other system metrics, we seek to answer the following fundamental questions: What are the spatial and temporal characteristics of delay performance in a real network? What are the most important impacting factors, and is there any practical model to capture those factors? What are the implications to protocol designs? In this paper, we identify important factors from the data trace and show that the important factors are not necessarily the same with those in the Internet. Furthermore, we propose a delay model to capture those factors. We revisit several prevalent protocol designs such as Collection Tree Protocol, opportunistic routing, and Dynamic Switching-based Forwarding and show that our model and analysis are useful to practical protocol designs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10738","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10738","fieldValue":"On the delay performance in a large-scale wireless sensor network: measurement, analysis, and implications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10739","fieldValue":" Recent years have shown a promising progress in understanding geometric underpinnings behind the structure, function, and dynamics of many complex networks in nature and society. However, these promises cannot be readily fulfilled and lead to important practical applications, without a simple, reliable, and fast network mapping method to infer the latent geometric coordinates of nodes in a real network. Here, we present HyperMap, a simple method to map a given real network to its hyperbolic space. The method utilizes a recent geometric theory of complex networks modeled as random geometric graphs in hyperbolic spaces. The method replays the network's geometric growth, estimating at each time-step the hyperbolic coordinates of new nodes in a growing network by maximizing the likelihood of the network snapshot in the model. We apply HyperMap to the Autonomous Systems (AS) Internet and find that: 1) the method produces meaningful results, identifying soft communities of ASs belonging to the same geographic region; 2) the method has a remarkable predictive power: Using the resulting map, we can predict missing links in the Internet with high precision, outperforming popular existing methods; and 3) the resulting map is highly navigable, meaning that a vast majority of greedy geometric routing paths are successful and low-stretch. Even though the method is not without limitations, and is open for improvement, it occupies a unique attractive position in the space of tradeoffs between simplicity, accuracy, and computational complexity."}
