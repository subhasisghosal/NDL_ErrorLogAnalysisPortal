{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2821","fieldValue":" In this article, an approach based on unknown words is proposed for meaningful term extraction and discriminative term selection in text categorization. For meaningful term extraction, a phrase-like unit (PLU)-based likelihood ratio is proposed to estimate the likelihood that a word sequence is an unknown word. On the other hand, a discriminative measure is proposed for term selection and is combined with the PLU-based likelihood ratio to determine the text category. We conducted several experiments on a news corpus, called MSDN. The MSDN corpus is collected from an online news Website maintained by the Min-Sheng Daily News, Taiwan. The corpus contains 44,675 articles with over 35 million words. The experimental results show that the system using a simple classifier achieved 95.31% accuracy. When using a state-of-the-art classifier, kNN, the average accuracy is 96.40%, outperforming all the other systems evaluated on the same collection, including the traditional term-word by kNN (88.52%); sleeping-experts (82.22%); sparse phrase by four-word sleeping-experts (86.34%); and Boolean combinations of words by RIPPER (87.54%). A proposed purification process can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature space from 50,576 terms in the word-based approach to 19,865 terms in the unknown word-based approach. In addition, more than 80% of automatically extracted terms are meaningful. Experiments also show that the proportion of meaningful terms extracted from training data is relative to the classification accuracy in outside testing."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2821","fieldValue":"Meaningful term extraction and discriminative term selection in text categorization via unknown-word methodology"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2821","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2821","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18810","fieldValue":" We describe the development of a data-level, massively parallel, software system for the solution of multicommodity network flow problems. Using a smooth linear-quadratic penalty (LQP) algorithm we transform the multicommodity network flow problem into a sequence of independent min-cost network flow subproblems. The solution of these problems is coordinated via a simple, dense, nonlinear master program to obtain a solution that is feasible within some user-specified tolerance to the original multicommodity network flow problem. Particular emphasis is placed on the mapping of both the subproblems and master problem data to the processing elements of a massively parallel computer, the Connection Machine CM-2. As a result of this design we can solve large and sparse optimization problems on current SIMD massively parallel architectures. Details of the implementation are reported, together with summary computational results with a set of test problems drawn from a Military Airlift Command application."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18810","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18810","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18811","fieldValue":" Incomplete factorization has been shown to be a good preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method on a wide variety of problems. It is well known that allowing some fill-in during the incomplete factorization can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed for convergence. Allowing fill-in, however, increases the time for the factorization and for the triangular system solutions. Additionally, it is difficult to predict a priori how much fill-in to allow and how to allow it. The unpredictability of the required storage\/work and the unknown benefits of the additional fill-in make such strategies impractical to use in many situations. In this article we motivate, and then present, two â\u20ACœblack-boxâ\u20AC? strategies that significantly increase the effectiveness of incomplete Cholesky factorization as a preconditioner. These strategies require no parameters from the user and do not increase the cost of the triangular system solutions. Efficient implementations for these algorithms are described. These algorithms are shown to be successful for a variety of problems from the Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix collection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18811","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18811","fieldValue":"ACM"}
