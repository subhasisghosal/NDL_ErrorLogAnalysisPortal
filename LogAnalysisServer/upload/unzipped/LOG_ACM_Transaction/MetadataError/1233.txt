Since this is not acceptable in many domains generating massive amounts of raw data (e.g., genomics), databases are entirely discarded. External tables, on the other hand, provide instant SQL querying over raw files. Their performance across a query workload is limited though by the speed of repeated full scans, tokenizing, and parsing of the entire file. In this article, we propose SCANRAW, a novel database meta-operator for in-situ processing over raw files that integrates data loading and external tables seamlessly, while preserving their advantages: optimal performance across a query workload and zero time-to-query. We decompose loading and external table processing into atomic stages in order to identify common functionality. We analyze alternative implementations and discuss possible optimizations for each stage. Our major contribution is a parallel superscalar pipeline implementation that allows SCANRAW to take advantage of the current many- and multicore processors by overlapping the execution of independent stages. Moreover, SCANRAW overlaps query processing with loading by speculatively using the additional I\/O bandwidth arising during the conversion process for storing data into the database, such that subsequent queries execute faster. As a result, SCANRAW makes intelligent use of the available system resourcesâ\u20AC\u201DCPU cycles and I\/O bandwidthâ\u20AC\u201Dby switching dynamically between tasks to ensure that optimal performance is achieved. We implement SCANRAW in a state-of-the-art database system and evaluate its performance across a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that SCANRAW with speculative loading achieves the best-possible performance for a query sequence at any point in the processing. Moreover, SCANRAW maximizes resource utilization for the entire workload execution while speculatively loading data and without interfering with normal query processing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14667","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14667","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14668","fieldValue":" Data in several applications can be represented as an uncertain graph whose edges are labeled with a probability of existence. Exact query processing on uncertain graphs is prohibitive for most applications, as it involves evaluation over an exponential number of instantiations. Thus, typical approaches employ Monte-Carlo sampling, which (i) draws a number of possible graphs (samples), (ii) evaluates the query on each of them, and (iii) aggregates the individual answers to generate the final result. However, this approach can also be extremely time consuming for large uncertain graphs commonly found in practice. To facilitate efficiency, we study the problem of extracting a single representative instance from an uncertain graph. Conventional processing techniques can then be applied on this representative to closely approximate the result on the original graph. In order to maintain data utility, the representative instance should preserve structural characteristics of the uncertain graph. We start with representatives that capture the expected vertex degrees, as this is a fundamental property of the graph topology. We then generalize the notion of vertex degree to the concept of n-clique cardinality, that is, the number of cliques of size n that contain a vertex. For the first problem, we propose two methods: Average Degree Rewiring (ADR), which is based on random edge rewiring, and Approximate B-Matching (ABM), which applies graph matching techniques. For the second problem, we develop a greedy approach and a game-theoretic framework. We experimentally demonstrate, with real uncertain graphs, that indeed the representative instances can be used to answer, efficiently and accurately, queries based on several metrics such as shortest path distance, clustering coefficient, and betweenness centrality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14669","fieldValue":" The CALM-conjecture, first stated by Hellerstein [2010] and proved in its revised form by Ameloot et al. [2013] within the framework of relational transducer networks, asserts that a query has a coordination-free execution strategy if and only if the query is monotone. Zinn et al. [2012] extended the framework of relational transducer networks to allow for specific data distribution strategies and showed that the nonmonotone win-move query is coordination-free for domain-guided data distributions. In this article, we extend the story by equating increasingly larger classes of coordination-free computations with increasingly weaker forms of monotonicity and present explicit Datalog variants that capture each of these classes. One such fragment is based on stratified Datalog where rules are required to be connected with the exception of the last stratum. In addition, we characterize coordination-freeness as those computations that do not require knowledge about all other nodes in the network, and therefore, can not globally coordinate. The results in this article can be interpreted as a more fine-grained answer to the CALM-conjecture."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14669","fieldValue":"Weaker Forms of Monotonicity for Declarative Networking: A More Fine-Grained Answer to the CALM-Conjecture"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14669","fieldValue":"ACM"}
