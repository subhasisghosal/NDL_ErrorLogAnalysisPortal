{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23860","fieldValue":" The continued growth of very large data environments such as Westlaw and Dialog, in addition to the World Wide Web, increases the importance of effective and efficient database selection and searching. Current research focuses largely on completely autonomous and automatic selection, searching, and results merging in distributed environments. This fully automatic approach has significant deficiencies, including reliance upon thresholds below which databases with relevant documents are not searched (compromised recall). It also merges documents, often from disparate data sources that users may have discarded before their source selection task proceeded (diluted precision). We examine the impact that early user interaction can have on the process of database selection. After analyzing thousands of real user queries, we show that precision can be significantly increased when queries are categorized by the users themselves, then handled effectively by the system. Such query categorization strategies may eliminate limitations of fully automated query processing approaches. Our system harnesses the WIN search engine, a sibling to INQUERY, run against one or more authority sources when search is required. We compare our approach to one that does not recognize or utilize distinct features associated with user queries. We show that by avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach that restricts the role users can play in information discovery, database selection effectiveness can be appreciably improved."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23860","fieldValue":"Early user---system interaction for database selection in massive domain-specific online environments"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23860","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23861","fieldValue":" This paper presents an in-depth analysis of a state-of-the-art Question Answering system. Several scenarios are examined: (1) the performance of each module in a serial baseline system, (2) the impact of feedbacks and the insertion of a logic prover, and (3) the impact of various retrieval strategies and lexical resources. The main conclusion is that the overall performance depends on the depth of natural language processing resources and the tools used for answer finding."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23861","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23862","fieldValue":"Hacid, Mohand-Said"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23862","fieldValue":" Content-based video database access control is becoming very important, but it depends on the progresses of the following related research issues: (a) efficient video analysis for supporting semantic visual concept representation; (b) effective video database indexing structure; (c) the development of suitable video database models; and (d) the development of access control models tailored to the characteristics of video data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to support multilevel access control in video databases. Our access control technique combines a video database indexing mechanism with a hierarchical organization of visual concepts (i.e., video database indexing units), so that different classes of users can access different video elements or even the same video element with different quality levels according to their permissions. These video elements, which, in our access control mechanism, are used for specifying the authorization objects, can be a semantic cluster, a subcluster, a video scene, a video shot, a video frame, or even a salient object (i.e., region of interest). In the paper, we first introduce our techniques for obtaining these multilevel video access units. We also propose a hierarchical video database indexing technique to support our multilevel video access control mechanism. Then, we present an innovative access control model which is able to support flexible multilevel access control to video elements. Moreover, the application of our multilevel video database modeling, representation, and indexing for MPEG-7 is discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23862","fieldValue":"ACM"}
