We consider ad hoc wireless networks with general conflict graph-based interference model and single-hop traffic. Each packet is associated with a deadline and will be dropped if it is not transmitted before the deadline. The number of packet arrivals in each time-slot and the maximum delay before the deadline are independent and identically distributed across time. We require a minimum fraction of packets to be delivered. At each link, we assume the link keeps track of the difference between the minimum number of packets that need to be delivered so far and the number of packets that are actually delivered, which we call the deficit. The largest-deficit-first (LDF) policy schedules links in descending order according to their deficit values, which is a variation of the longest-queue-first (LQF) policy for non-real-time traffic. We prove that the efficiency ratio of LDF, which is the fraction of the throughput region that LDF can achieve for given traffic distributions, can be lower-bounded by a quantity that we call the real-time local-pooling factor (R-LPF). We further prove that a lower bound on the R-LPF can be related to the weighted sum of the service rates, with a special case of 1\/(β + 1) by considering the uniform weight, where β is the interference degree of the conflict graph. We also propose a heuristic consensus algorithm that can be used to obtain a good weight vector for such lower bounds for given network topology."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10852","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10852","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10852","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10853","fieldValue":"Wang, Chih-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10853","fieldValue":"Ko, Chun-Han"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10853","fieldValue":"Wei, Hung-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10853","fieldValue":" An overlay macrocell-femtocell system aims to increase the system capacity with a low-cost infrastructure. To construct such an infrastructure, we need to solve some existing problems. First, there is a tradeoff between femtocell coverage and overall system throughput, which we defined as the cell-breathing phenomenon. In light of this, we propose a femtocell downlink cell-breathing control framework to strike a balance between the coverage and data rate. Second, due to the selfish nature of mobile stations, the system information collected from them does not necessarily reflect the true status of the system. Thus, we design FEmtocell Virtual Election Rule (FEVER), a voting-based direct mechanism that only requires users to report their channel quality information to the femtocell base station. Not only is it proved to be truthful and has low implementation complexity, but it also strikes a balance between efficiency and fairness to meet the different needs. The simulation results verify the enhanced system performance under the FEVER mechanism."}
