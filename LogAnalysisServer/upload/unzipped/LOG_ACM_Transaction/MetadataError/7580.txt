We exploit the inherent diversity of the broadcast nature of wireless by making use of multipath routing. We present a novel optimization framework for opportunistic routing based on network utility maximization (NUM) that enables us to derive optimal flow control, routing, scheduling, and rate adaptation schemes, where we use network coding to ease the routing problem. All previous work on NUM assumed unicast transmissions; however, the wireless medium is by its nature broadcast and a transmission will be received by multiple nodes. The structure of our design is fundamentally different; this is due to the fact that our link rate constraints are defined per broadcast region instead of links in isolation. We prove optimality and derive a primal-dual algorithm that lays the basis for a practical protocol. Optimal MAC scheduling is difficult to implement, and we use 802.11-like random scheduling rather than optimal in our comparisons. Under random scheduling, our protocol becomes fully decentralized (we assume ideal signaling). The use of network coding introduces additional constraints on scheduling, and we propose a novel scheme to avoid starvation. We simulate realistic topologies and show that we can achieve 20%-200% throughput improvement compared to single path routing, and several times compared to a recent related opportunistic protocol (MORE)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9968","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9968","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9968","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9969","fieldValue":" One approach to prolong the lifetime of a wireless sensor network (WSN) is to deploy some relay nodes to communicate with the sensor nodes, other relay nodes, and the base stations. The relay node placement problem for wireless sensor networks is concerned with placing a minimum number of relay nodes into a wireless sensor network to meet certain connectivity or survivability requirements. Previous studies have concentrated on the unconstrained version of the problem in the sense that relay nodes can be placed anywhere. In practice, there may be some physical constraints on the placement of relay nodes. To address this issue, we study constrained versions of the relay node placement problem, where relay nodes can only be placed at a set of candidate locations. In the connected relay node placement problem, we want to place a minimum number of relay nodes to ensure that each sensor node is connected with a base station through a bidirectional path. In the survivable relay node placement problem, we want to place a minimum number of relay nodes to ensure that each sensor node is connected with two base stations (or the only base station in case there is only one base station) through two node-disjoint bidirectional paths. For each of the two problems, we discuss its computational complexity and present a framework of polynomial time O(1)-approximation algorithms with small approximation ratios. Extensive numerical results showthat our approximation algorithms can produce solutions very close to optimal solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9969","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9969","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9969","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9970","fieldValue":" This paper develops a simple and accurate stochastic model for the steady-state throughput of a TCP NewReno bulk data transfer as a function of round-trip time and loss behavior. Our model builds upon extensive prior work on TCP Reno throughput models but differs from these prior works in three key aspects. First, our model introduces an analytical characterization of the TCP NewReno fast recovery algorithm. Second, our model incorporates an accurate formulation of NewReno's timeout behavior. Third, our model is formulated using a flexible two-parameter loss model that can better represent the diverse packet loss scenarios encountered by TCP on the Internet. We validated our model by conducting a large number of simulations using the ns-2 simulator and by conducting emulation and Internet experiments using a NewReno implementation in the BSD TCP\/IP protocol stack. The main findings from the experiments are: 1) the proposed model accurately predicts the steady-state throughput for TCP NewReno bulk data transfers under a wide range of network conditions; 2) TCP NewReno significantly outperforms TCP Reno in many of the scenarios considered; and 3) using existing TCP Reno models to estimate TCP NewReno throughput may introduce significant errors."}
