Outputs of the routing arbitration units in NoC routers can be used to determine arbitration failures, because the valid arbitration outputs are a subset of all possible values. This feature is exploited to detect and correct logic and register errors in the router arbitration control path. The proposed method is complementary to other error management methods for NoC routers. An analytical reliability model of our method is provided, including parameters such as logic unit size, different error rates for logic gates and registers, and the location of faulty elements. Compared to triple-modular redundancy (TMR), the proposed method improves the arbiter reliability by two orders of magnitude while reducing the total area and power by 43&percnt; and 64&percnt;, respectively. In the presented case studies, two traffic traces from the PARSEC benchmark suite are used to evaluate the average latency and energy consumption. Simulations performed on a 4Ã\u2014 4 NoC show that our method reduces the average latency by up to 50&percnt; and reduces average energy by up to 70&percnt; compared to other methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6701","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6701","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6702","fieldValue":"Snchez, Jos LUIS"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6702","fieldValue":" Networks-on-chip need to survive to manufacturing faults in order to sustain yield. An effective testing and configuration strategy however implies two opposite requirements. One one hand, a fast and scalable built-in self-testing and self-diagnosis procedure has to be carried out concurrently at NoC switches. On the other hand, programming the NoC routing mechanism to go around faulty links and switches can be optimally performed by a centralized controller with global network visibility. To the best of our knowledge, this article proposes for the first time a global network testing and configuration strategy that meets the opposite requirements by means of a fault-tolerant dual network architecture and a fast configuration algorithm for the most common failure patterns. Experimental results report an area overhead as low as 12.5&percnt; with respect to the baseline switch architecture while achieving a high degree of fault tolerance. In fact, even when multiple stuck-at faults are considered, the capability of fault masking by the dual network is always over 80&percnt;, and the support for multiple link failures is more than 90&percnt; in presence of two unusable links in the main network with minimum set-up times."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6702","fieldValue":"ACM"}
