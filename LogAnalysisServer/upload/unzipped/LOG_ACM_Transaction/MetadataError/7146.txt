On the one hand, the definition in RFC 2598 can be used to predict extremely low end-to-end delay jitter, independent of the network scale. On the other hand, we find that the worst case delay jitter can be made arbitrarily large, while each flow traverses at most a specified number of hops, if we allow networks to become arbitrarily large; this is in contradiction with the previous statement. We analyze where the contradiction originates and find the explanation. It resides in the fact that the definition in RFC 2598 is not easily implementable in schedulers we know of, mainly because it is not formal enough, and also because it does not contain an error term. We propose a new definition for the EF PHB, called \"packet scale rate guarantee\" (PSRG) that preserves the spirit of RFC 2598 while allowing a number of reasonable implementations and has very useful properties for per-node and end-to-end network engineering. We show that this definition implies a rate-latency service curve property. We also show that it is equivalent, in some sense, to the stronger concept of \"adaptive service guarantee.\" Then we propose some proven bounds on delay jitter for networks implementing this new definition, both in cases without loss and with loss."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9112","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9113","fieldValue":" Prompted by the advent of quality-of-service routing in the Internet, we investigate the properties that path weight functions must have so that hop-by-hop routing is possible and optimal paths can be computed with a generalized Dijkstra's algorithm. For this purpose, we define an algebra of weights which contains a binary operation, for the composition of link weights into path weights, and an order relation. Isotonicity is the key property of the algebra. It states that the order relation between the weights of any two paths is preserved if both of them are either prefixed or appended by a common, third, path.We show that isotonicity is both necessary and sufficient for a generalized Dijkstra's algorithm to yield optimal paths. Likewise, isotonicity is also both necessary and sufficient for hop-by-hop routing. However, without strict isotonicity, hop-by-hop routing based on optimal paths may produce routing loops. They are prevented if every node computes what we call lexicographic-optimal paths. These paths can be computed with an enhanced Dijkstra's algorithm that has the same complexity as the standard one. Our findings are extended to multipath routing as well.As special cases of the general approach, we conclude that shortest-widest paths can neither be computed with a generalized Dijkstra's algorithm nor can packets be routed hop-by-hop over those paths. In addition, loop-free hop-by-hop routing over widest and widest-shortest paths requires each node to compute lexicographic-optimal paths, in general."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9113","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9113","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9113","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1819","fieldValue":"Rosas-Ham, Demian"}
