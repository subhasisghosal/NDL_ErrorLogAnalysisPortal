We present the design and use of a Fortran 2003 wrapper for POSIX threads, called forthreads. Forthreads is complete in the sense that is provides native Fortran 2003 interfaces to all pthreads routines where possible. We demonstrate the use and efficiency of forthreads for SIMD parallelism and task parallelism. We present forthreads\/MPI implementations that enable hybrid shared-\/distributed-memory parallelism in Fortran 2003. Our benchmarks show that forthreads offers performance comparable to that of OpenMP, but better thread control and more freedom. We demonstrate the latter by presenting a multithreaded Fortran 2003 library for POSIX Internet sockets, enabling interactive numerical simulations with runtime control."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19380","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19380","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2874","fieldValue":" Although Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) is a widely used technique for enhancing average retrieval performance, it may actually hurt performance for around one-third of a given set of topics. To enhance the reliability of PRF, Flexible PRF has been proposed, which adjusts the number of pseudo-relevant documents and\/or the number of expansion terms for each topic. This paper explores a new, inexpensive Flexible PRF method, called Selective Sampling, which is unique in that it can skip documents in the initial ranked output to look for more â\u20ACœnovelâ\u20AC? pseudo-relevant documents. While Selective Sampling is only comparable to Traditional PRF in terms of average performance and reliability, per-topic analyses show that Selective Sampling outperforms Traditional PRF almost as often as Traditional PRF outperforms Selective Sampling. Thus, treating the top P documents as relevant is often not the best strategy. However, predicting when Selective Sampling outperforms Traditional PRF appears to be as difficult as predicting when a PRF method fails. For example, our per-topic analyses show that even the proportion of truly relevant documents in the pseudo-relevant set is not necessarily a good performance predictor."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2874","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2874","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19381","fieldValue":"Temme, Nico M"}
