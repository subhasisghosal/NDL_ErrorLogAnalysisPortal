There are many literature works focusing on predicting miRNA targets and exploring gene regulatory networks of miRNA families. We suggest, however, the study to identify the interaction between miRNAs is insufficient. This paper presents a framework to identify relationships between miRNAs using joint entropy, to investigate the regulatory features of miRNAs. Both the sequence and secondary structure are taken into consideration to make our method more relevant from the biological viewpoint. Further, joint entropy is applied to identify correlated miRNAs, which are more desirable from the perspective of the gene regulatory network. A data set including Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae is used in the experiment. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to identify known miRNA interaction and uncover novel patterns of miRNA regulatory network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4911","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4911","fieldValue":"Entropy,Joints,RNA,Educational institutions,Databases,Computational biology,joint entropy,Entropy,Joints,RNA,Educational institutions,Databases,Computational biology,interaction,Structure,similarity,miRNA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4911","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4911","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4912","fieldValue":" In this work, we model the problem of mining quasi-bicliques from weighted viral-host protein-protein interaction network as a biclustering problem for identifying strong interaction modules. In this regard, a multiobjective genetic algorithm-based biclustering technique is proposed that simultaneously optimizes three objective functions to obtain dense biclusters having high mean interaction strengths. The performance of the proposed technique has been compared with that of other existing biclustering methods on an artificial data. Subsequently, the proposed biclustering method is applied on the records of biologically validated and predicted interactions between a set of HIV-1 proteins and a set of human proteins to identify strong interaction modules. For this, the entire interaction information is realized as a bipartite graph. We have further investigated the biological significance of the obtained biclusters. The human proteins involved in the strong interaction module have been found to share common biological properties and they are identified as the gateways of viral infection leading to various diseases. These human proteins can be potential drug targets for developing anti-HIV drugs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4912","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4912","fieldValue":"Proteins,Humans,Bipartite graph,Biological cells,Optimization,Linear programming,Bioinformatics,quasi-biclique,Proteins,Humans,Bipartite graph,Biological cells,Optimization,Linear programming,Bioinformatics,multiobjective optimization,Protein-protein interaction,HIV-1,biclustering"}
