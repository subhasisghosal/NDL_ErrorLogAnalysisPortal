{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11775","fieldValue":" This article presents a may-happen-in-parallel (MHP) analysis for languages with actor-based concurrency. In this concurrency model, actors are the concurrency units such that, when a method is invoked on an actor $a_2 from a task executing on actor a1, statements of the current task in a1 may run in parallel with those of the (asynchronous) call on a2$, and with those of transitively invoked methods. The goal of the MHP analysis is to identify pairs of statements in the program that may run in parallel in any execution. Our MHP analysis is formalized as a method-level (local) analysis whose information can be modularly composed to obtain application-level (global) information. The information yielded by the MHP analysis is essential to infer more complex properties of actor-based concurrent programs, for example, data race detection, deadlock freeness, termination, and resource consumption analyses can greatly benefit from the MHP relations to increase their accuracy. We report on MayPar, a prototypical implementation of an MHP static analyzer for a distributed asynchronous language."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11776","fieldValue":" Desirable properties of a logic include decidability, and a model theory that inherits properties of first-order logic, such as interpolation and preservation theorems. It is known that the Guarded Fragment (GF) of first-order logic is decidable and satisfies some preservation properties from first-order model theory; however, it fails to have Craig interpolation. The Guarded Negation Fragment (GNF), a recently defined extension, is known to be decidable and to have Craig interpolation. Here we give the first results on effective interpolation for extensions of GF. We provide an interpolation procedure for GNF whose complexity matches the doubly exponential upper bound for satisfiability of GNF. We show that the same construction gives not only Craig interpolation, but Lyndon interpolation and relativized interpolation, which can be used to provide effective proofs of some preservation theorems. We provide upper bounds on the size of GNF interpolants for both GNF and GF input, and complement this with matching lower bounds."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11777","fieldValue":" A common assumption in belief revision is that the reliability of the information sources is either given, derived from temporal information, or the same for all. This article does not describe a new semantics for integration but studies the problem of obtaining the reliability of the sources given the result of a previous merging. As an example, corrections performed manually on the result of merging some databases may indicate that the relative reliability of their sources is different from what was previously assumed, helping subsequent data mergings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11777","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11777","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11778","fieldValue":" We study the problem of checking whether an existential sentence (i.e., a first-order sentence in prefix form built using existential quantifiers and all Boolean connectives) is true in a finite partially ordered set (a poset). A poset is a reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive digraph. The problem encompasses the fundamental embedding problem of finding an isomorphic copy of a poset as an induced substructure of another poset. Model checking existential logic is already NP-hard on a fixed poset; thus, we investigate structural properties of posets yielding conditions for fixed-parameter tractability when the problem is parameterized by the sentence. We identify width as a central structural property (the width of a poset is the maximum size of a subset of pairwise incomparable elements); our main algorithmic result is that model checking existential logic on classes of finite posets of bounded width is fixed-parameter tractable. We observe a similar phenomenon in classical complexity, in which we prove that the isomorphism problem is polynomial-time tractable on classes of posets of bounded width; this settles an open problem in order theory. We surround our main algorithmic result with complexity results on less restricted, natural neighboring classes of finite posets, establishing its tightness in this sense. We also relate our work with (and demonstrate its independence of) fundamental fixed-parameter tractability results for model checking on digraphs of bounded degree and bounded clique-width."}
