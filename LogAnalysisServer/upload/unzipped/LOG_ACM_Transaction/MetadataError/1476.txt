In this article we present a novel multi-level technique for fast character adaptation. We specifically target environments where there is a cooperative or competitive relationship between the character and the human that interacts with that character.In our technique, a distinct learning method is applied to each layer of the character's behavioral or cognitive model. This allows us to efficiently leverage the character's observations and experiences in each layer. This also provides a convenient temporal distinction between what observations and experiences provide pertinent lessons for each layer. Thus the character can quickly and robustly learn how to better interact with any given unique human user, relying only on observations and natural performance feedback from the environment (no explicit feedback from the human). Our technique is designed to be general, and can be easily integrated into most existing behavioral animation systems. It is also fast and memory efficient."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15509","fieldValue":" Mappings between surfaces have a variety of uses, including texture transfer, multi-way morphing, and surface analysis. Given a 4D implicit function that defines a morph between two implicit surfaces, this article presents a method of calculating a mapping between the two surfaces. We create such a mapping by solving two PDEs over a tetrahedralized hypersurface that connects the two surfaces in 4D. Solving the first PDE yields a vector field that indicates how points on one surface flow to the other. Solving the second PDE propagates position labels along this vector field so that the second surface is tagged with a unique position on the first surface. One strength of this method is that it produces correspondences between surfaces even when they have different topologies. Even if the surfaces split apart or holes appear, the method still produces a mapping entirely automatically. We demonstrate the use of this approach to transfer texture between two surfaces that may have differing topologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15510","fieldValue":" Conformal parameterization of mesh models has numerous applicationsin geometry processing. Conformality is desirable for remeshing,surface reconstruction, and many other mesh processingapplications. Subject to the conformality requirement, theseapplications typically benefit from parameterizations with smallerstretch. The Angle Based Flattening (ABF) method, presented a fewyears ago, generates provably valid conformal parameterizationswith low stretch. However, it is quite time-consuming and becomeserror prone for large meshes due to numerical error accumulation.This work presents ABF&plus;&plus;, a highly efficientextension of the ABF method, that overcomes these drawbacks whilemaintaining all the advantages of ABF. ABF++ robustly parameterizesmeshes of hundreds of thousands and millions of triangles withinminutes. It is based on three main components: (1) a new numericalsolution technique that dramatically reduces the dimension of thelinear systems solved at each iteration, speeding up the solution;(2) a new robust scheme for reconstructing the 2D coordinates fromthe angle space solution that avoids the numerical instabilitieswhich hindered the ABF reconstruction scheme; and (3) an efficienthierarchical solution technique. The speedup with (1) does not comeat the expense of greater distortion. The hierarchical technique(3) enables parameterization of models with millions of faces inseconds at the expense of a minor increase in parametricdistortion. The parameterization computed by ABF++ are provablyvalid, that is they contain no flipped triangles. As a result ofthese extensions, the ABF++ method is extremely suitable forrobustly and efficiently parameterizing models forgeometry-processing applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15510","fieldValue":"ACM"}
