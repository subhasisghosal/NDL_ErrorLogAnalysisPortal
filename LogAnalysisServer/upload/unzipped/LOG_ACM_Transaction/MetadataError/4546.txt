{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24752","fieldValue":" A new perspective of the validation problemfor simulation models is formulated in this article. The approach is knowledge-based and focuses on behavioral validation. It has the important feature of providing a basis for the development of a software environment that can automate the validation activity. Discrete, continuous and combined simulation models can be treated in a uniform manner.The key element of the approach is a validation knowledge base (VKB). This is developed as three disjoint sets of relationships among the input and output variables of the simulation model. These relationships serve to capture all aspects of expected behavior of the simulation model. A simple characterization of model behavior is presented which provides the basis for specifying the relationships from which the VKB is constructedThe utilization of all the information in the VKB in an efficient way is an important subgoal of our system architecture. This requirement gives rise to an experiment design problem. This problem is carefully formulated and examined within the framework of the behavior characterizations that exist in the VKB. In particular, a basis for its solution is established in a constraint set framework by carrying out a transformation on the relationships within the VKB. The constraint set context for the problem has the advantage of providing an environment which not only facilitates analysis but also enables the application of a variety of solution techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3392","fieldValue":" Gaze analysis and prediction in interactive virtual environments, such as games, is a challenging topic since the 3D perspective and variations of the viewpoint as well as the current task introduce many variables that affect the distribution of gaze. In this article, we present a novel pipeline to study eye-tracking data acquired from interactive 3D applications. The result of the pipeline is an importance map which scores the amount of gaze spent on each object. This importance map is then used as a heuristic to predict a user's visual attention according to the object properties present at runtime. The novelty of this approach is that the analysis is performed in object space and the importance map is defined in the feature space of high-level properties. High-level properties are used to encode task relevance and other attributes, such as eccentricity, which may have an impact on gaze behavior. The pipeline has been tested with an exemplary study on a first-person shooter game. In particular, a protocol is presented describing the data acquisition procedure, the learning of different importance maps from the data, and finally an evaluation of the performance of the derived gaze predictors. A metric measuring the degree of correlation between attention predicted by the importance map and the actual gaze yielded clearly positive results. The correlation becomes particularly strong when the player is attentive to an in-game task."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3392","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3392","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24753","fieldValue":" The fixed vector of any m-sequence based on a trinomial is explicitly obtained.
