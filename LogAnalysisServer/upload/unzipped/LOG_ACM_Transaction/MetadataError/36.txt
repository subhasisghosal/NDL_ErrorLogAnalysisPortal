Much of this knowledge can remain tacit because of shared ways of becoming a disciplinary scholar within any particular area of computing. But such tacitness presents challenges for computing education scholarship, since knowledge about how to create and validate claims about human thinking and learning is rarely a part of the training for computing educators. The editors-in-chief of TOCE have responded to these challenges by making explicit the epistemic practices associated with the publication of its manuscripts, by encouraging a range of borrowing from other disciplines, and by instituting feedback loops at all levels of review."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11095","fieldValue":"Yudelson, Michael V"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11095","fieldValue":"Lee, Danielle H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11095","fieldValue":" Rich, interactive eLearning tools receive a lot of attention nowadays from both practitioners and researchers. However, broader dissemination of these tools is hindered by the technical difficulties of their integration into existing platforms. This article explores the technical and conceptual problems of using several interactive educational tools in the context of a single course. It presents an integrated Exploratorium for database courses, an experimental platform, which provides personalized access to several types of interactive learning activities. Several classroom studies of the Exploratorium have demonstrated its value in both the integration of several tools and the provision of personalized access."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/11095","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"10.1145.1656255.1656257\"}"}
