Instead, the result to such queries is typically a rank of the \"top k\" tuples that best match the given attribute values. In this paper, we study the advantages and limitations of processing a top-k query by translating it into a single range query that a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) can process efficiently. In particular, we study how to determine a range query to evaluate a top-k query by exploiting the statistics available to an RDBMS, and the impact of the quality of these statistics on the retrieval efficiency of the resulting scheme. We also report the first experimental evaluation of the mapping strategies over a real RDBMS, namely over Microsoft's SQL Server 7.0. The experiments show that our new techniques are robust and significantly more efficient than previously known strategies requiring at least one sequential scan of the data sets."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/14299","fieldValue":"Top-<i>k<\/i> query processing"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14300","fieldValue":" Similarity search in large time series databases has attracted much research interest recently. It is a difficult problem because of the typically high dimensionality of the data. The most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In this article, we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique, which we call Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA). While previous techniques (e.g., SVD, DFT and DWT) choose a common representation for all the items in the database that minimizes the global reconstruction error, APCA approximates each time series by a set of constant value segments of varying lengths such that their individual reconstruction errors are minimal. We show how APCA can be indexed using a multidimensional index structure. We propose two distance measures in the indexed space that exploit the high fidelity of APCA for fast searching: a lower bounding Euclidean distance approximation, and a non-lower-bounding, but very tight, Euclidean distance approximation, and show how they can support fast exact searching and even faster approximate searching on the same index structure. We theoretically and empirically compare APCA to all the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14300","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14300","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14301","fieldValue":" The notion of roll-up dependency (RUD) extends functional dependencies with generalization hierarchies. RUDs can be applied in OLAP and database design. The problem of discovering RUDs in large databases is at the center of this paper. An algorithm is provided that relies on a number of theoretical results. The algorithm has been implemented; results on two real-life datasets are given. The extension of functional dependency (FD) with roll-ups turns out to capture meaningful rules that are outside the scope of classical FD mining. Performance figures show that RUDs can be discovered in linear time in the number of tuples of the input dataset."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14301","fieldValue":"ACM"}
