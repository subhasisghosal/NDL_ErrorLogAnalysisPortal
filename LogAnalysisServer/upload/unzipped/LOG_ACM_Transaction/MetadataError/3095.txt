It turns out that, according to the incrementally paradigm of the attribute evaluator and data-flow analyzer to be used, two definitions of optimal incrementality in a parser are possible. Algorithms for achieving both forms of optimality are given, both of them based on ordinary LALR(1) parse tables. Optimality and correctness proofs, which are merely outlined in this communication, are made intuitive thanks to the concept of a well-formed list of threaded trees, a natural extension of the concept of threaded tree found in earlier works on incremental parsing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20262","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20262","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20263","fieldValue":"Tsay, Yih-Kuen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20263","fieldValue":" We explore the use of UNITY logic in specifying and verifying fairness properties of UNITY and UNITY-like programs whose semantics can be modeled by weakly fair transition systems.
