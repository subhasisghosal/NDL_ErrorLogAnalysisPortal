In this article, we present a class separability framework to tackle these challenges through a comprehensive analysis of community properties. Our approach enables the assessment of the structural dissimilarity among the output of multiple community detection algorithms and between the output of algorithms and communities that arise in practice. In addition, our method provides us with a way to organize the vast collection of community detection algorithms by grouping those that behave similarly. Finally, we identify the most discriminative graph-theoretical properties of community signature and the small subset of properties that account for most of the biases of the different community detection algorithms. We illustrate our approach with an experimental analysis, which reveals nuances of the structure of real and extracted communities. In our experiments, we furnish our framework with the output of 10 different community detection procedures, representative of categories of popular algorithms available in the literature, applied to a diverse collection of large-scale real network datasets whose domains span biology, online shopping, and social systems. We also analyze communities identified by annotations that accompany the data, which reflect exemplar communities in various domain. We characterize these communities using a broad spectrum of community properties to produce the different structural classes. As our experiments show that community structure is not a universal concept, our framework enables an informed choice of the most suitable community detection method for identifying communities of a specific type in a given network and allows for a comparison of existing community detection algorithms while guiding the design of new ones."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7965","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7965","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7966","fieldValue":" Accurate prediction of user behaviors is important for many social media applications, including social marketing, personalization, and recommendation. A major challenge lies in that although many previous works model user behavior from only historical behavior logs, the available user behavior data or interactions between users and items in a given social network are usually very limited and sparse (e.g., &ges; 99.9&percnt; empty), which makes models overfit the rare observations and fail to provide accurate predictions. We observe that many people are members of several social networks in the same time, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tencentâ\u20AC™s QQ. Importantly, usersâ\u20AC™ behaviors and interests in different networks influence one another. This provides an opportunity to leverage the knowledge of user behaviors in different networks by considering the overlapping users in different networks as bridges, in order to alleviate the data sparsity problem, and enhance the predictive performance of user behavior modeling. Combining different networks â\u20ACœsimply and naivelyâ\u20AC? does not work well. In this article, we formulate the problem to model multiple networks as â\u20ACœadaptive composite transferâ\u20AC? and propose a framework called ComSoc. ComSoc first selects the most suitable networks inside a composite social network via a hierarchical Bayesian model, parameterized for individual users. It then builds topic models for user behavior prediction using both the relationships in the selected networks and related behavior data. With different relational regularization, we introduce different implementations, corresponding to different ways to transfer knowledge from composite social relations. To handle big data, we have implemented the algorithm using Map\/Reduce. We demonstrate that the proposed composite network-based user behavior models significantly improve the predictive accuracy over a number of existing approaches on several real-world applications, including a very large social networking dataset from Tencent Inc."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7966","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7966","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7967","fieldValue":"Ahmed, Nesreen K"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7967","fieldValue":" Network sampling is integral to the analysis of social, information, and biological networks. Since many real-world networks are massive in size, continuously evolving, and\/or distributed in nature, the network structure is often sampled in order to facilitate study. For these reasons, a more thorough and complete understanding of network sampling is critical to support the field of network science. In this paper, we outline a framework for the general problem of network sampling by highlighting the different objectives, population and units of interest, and classes of network sampling methods. In addition, we propose a spectrum of computational models for network sampling methods, ranging from the traditionally studied model based on the assumption of a static domain to a more challenging model that is appropriate for streaming domains. We design a family of sampling methods based on the concept of graph induction that generalize across the full spectrum of computational models (from static to streaming) while efficiently preserving many of the topological properties of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how traditional static sampling algorithms can be modified for graph streams for each of the three main classes of sampling methods: node, edge, and topology-based sampling. Experimental results indicate that our proposed family of sampling methods more accurately preserve the underlying properties of the graph in both static and streaming domains. Finally, we study the impact of network sampling algorithms on the parameter estimation and performance evaluation of relational classification algorithms."}
