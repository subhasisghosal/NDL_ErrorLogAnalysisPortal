However, their inherent security weaknesses allow attacks against the integrity of Web sessions. HTTPS is often recommended to protect cookies, but deploying full HTTPS support can be challenging due to performance and financial concerns, especially for highly distributed applications. Moreover, cookies can be exposed in a variety of ways even when HTTPS is enabled. In this article, we propose one-time cookies (OTC), a more robust alternative for session authentication. OTC prevents attacks such as session hijacking by signing each user request with a session secret securely stored in the browser. Unlike other proposed solutions, OTC does not require expensive state synchronization in the Web application, making it easily deployable in highly distributed systems. We implemented OTC as a plug-in for the popular WordPress platform and as an extension for Firefox and Firefox for mobile browsers. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that OTC introduces a latency of less than 6 ms when compared to cookiesâ\u20AC\u201Da negligible overhead for most Web applications. Moreover, we show that OTC can be combined with HTTPS to effectively add another layer of security to Web applications. In so doing, we demonstrate that one-time cookies can significantly improve the security of Web applications with minimal impact on performance and scalability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24439","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24439","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24440","fieldValue":" One of the main goals of Cloud and Grid infrastructures is to make their services easily accessible and attractive to end-users. In this article we investigate the problem of supporting keyword-based searching for the discovery of software files that are installed on the nodes of large-scale, federated Grid and Cloud computing infrastructures. We address a number of challenges that arise from the unstructured nature of software and the unavailability of software-related metadata on large-scale networked environments. We present Minersoft, a harvester that visits Grid\/Cloud infrastructures, crawls their file systems, identifies and classifies software files, and discovers implicit associations between them. The results of Minersoft harvesting are encoded in a weighted, typed graph, called the Software Graph. A number of information retrieval (IR) algorithms are used to enrich this graph with structural and content associations, to annotate software files with keywords and build inverted indexes to support keyword-based searching for software. Using a real testbed, we present an evaluation study of our approach, using data extracted from production-quality Grid and Cloud computing infrastructures. Experimental results show that Minersoft is a powerful tool for software search and discovery."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24440","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24440","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24441","fieldValue":" In order to improve scalability and to reduce the maintenance overhead for structured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, researchers have proposed architectures based on several interconnection networks with a fixed-degree and a logarithmical diameter. Among existing fixed-degree interconnection networks, the Kautz digraph has many distinctive topological properties compared to others. It, however, requires that the number of peers have the some given values, determined by peer degree and network diameter. In practice, we cannot guarantee how many peers will join a P2P network at a given time, since a P2P network is typically dynamic with peers frequently entering and leaving. To address such an issue, we propose the balanced Kautz tree and Kautz ring structures. We further design a novel structured P2P system, called BAKE, based on the two structures that has the logarithmical diameter and constant degree, even the number of peers is an arbitrary value. By keeping a total ordering of peers and employing a robust locality-preserved resource placement strategy, resources that are similar in a single or multidimensional attributes space are stored on the same peer or neighboring peers. Through analysis and simulation, we show that BAKE achieves the optimal diameter and as good a connectivity as the Kautz digraph does (almost achieves the Moore bound), and supports the exact as well as the range queries efficiently. Indeed, the structures of balanced Kautz tree and Kautz ring we propose can also be applied to other interconnection networks after minimal modifications, for example, the de Bruijn digraph."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24441","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24441","fieldValue":"ACM"}
