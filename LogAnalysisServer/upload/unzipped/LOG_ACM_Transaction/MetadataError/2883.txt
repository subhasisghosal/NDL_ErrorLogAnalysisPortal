However, such matchings are known to be NP-hard to compute on 3-manifolds through a reduction to the erasability problem. Here, we refine the study of the complexity of problems related to discrete Morse theory in terms of parameterized complexity. On the one hand, we prove that the erasability problem is W[P]-complete on the natural parameter. On the other hand, we propose an algorithm for computing optimal Morse matchings on triangulations of 3-manifolds, which is fixed-parameter tractable in the treewidth of the bipartite graph representing the adjacency of the 1- and 2-simplices. This algorithm also shows fixed-parameter tractability for problems such as erasability and maximum alternating cycle-free matching. We further show that these results are also true when the treewidth of the dual graph of the triangulated 3-manifold is bounded. Finally, we discuss the topological significance of the chosen parameters and investigate the respective treewidths of simplicial and generalized triangulations of 3-manifolds."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19428","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Department of Mathematics, Pontif&#237;cia Universidade Cat&#243;lica, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Lewiner, Thomas; Paixo, Joo); School of Mathematics and Physics, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia (Burton, Benjamin A.; Spreer, Jonathan)"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19428","fieldValue":"<i>W<\/i>[<i>P<\/i>]-completeness"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19428","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19428","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19429","fieldValue":" New approximations for the inverse of the incomplete gamma function are derived, which are used to develop efficient evaluations of the inverse Poisson cumulative distribution function. An asymptotic approximation based on the standard Normal approximation is particularly good for CPUs with MIMD cores, while for GPUs and other hardware with vector units, a second asymptotic approximation based on Temme's approximation of the incomplete gamma function is more efficient due to conditional branching within each vector. The accuracy and efficiency of the software implementations is assessed on both CPUs and GPUs."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19429","fieldValue":"CUDA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19429","fieldValue":"GPU"}
