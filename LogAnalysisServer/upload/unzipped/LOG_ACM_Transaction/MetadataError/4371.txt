{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24103","fieldValue":" The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is acknowledged as the de facto standard for semistructured data representation and data exchange on the Web and many other scenarios. A well-known shortcoming of XML is its verbosity, which increases manipulation, transmission, and processing costs. Various structure-blind and structure-conscious compression techniques can be applied to XML, and some are even access-friendly, meaning that the documents can be efficiently accessed in compressed form. Direct access is necessary to implement the query languages XPath and XQuery, which are the standard ones to exploit the expressiveness of XML. While a good deal of theoretical and practical proposals exist to solve XPath\/XQuery operations on XML, only a few ones are well integrated with a compression format that supports the required access operations on the XML data. In this work we go one step further and design a compression format for XML collections that boosts the performance of XPath queries on the data. This is done by designing compressed representations of the XML data that support some complex operations apart from just accessing the data, and those are exploited to solve key components of the XPath queries. Our system, called XXS, is aimed at XML collections containing natural language text, which are compressed to within 35&percnt;--50&percnt; of their original size while supporting a large subset of XPath operations in time competitive with, and many times outperforming, the best state-of-the-art systems that work on uncompressed representations."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24103","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24103","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24103","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24104","fieldValue":" This article presents an overview of the video copy detection benchmark which was run over a period of 4 years (2008--2011) as part of the TREC Video Retrieval (TRECVID) workshop series. The main contributions of the article include i) an examination of the evolving design of the evaluation framework and its components (system tasks, data, measures); ii) a high-level overview of results and best-performing approaches; and iii) a discussion of lessons learned over the four years. The content-based copy detection (CCD) benchmark worked with a large collection of synthetic queries, which is atypical for TRECVID, as was the use of a normalized detection cost framework. These particular evaluation design choices are motivated and appraised."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24104","fieldValue":"TRECVID"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24104","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24104","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24105","fieldValue":" The prediction of trust relationships in social networks plays an important role in the analytics of the networks. Although various link prediction algorithms for general networks may be adapted for this purpose, the recent notion of â\u20ACœtrust propagationâ\u20AC? has been shown to effectively capture the trust-formation mechanisms and resulted in an effective prediction algorithm. This article builds on the concept of trust propagation and presents a probabilistic trust propagation model. Our model exploits the modern framework of probabilistic graphical models, more specifically, factor graphs. Under this model, the trust prediction problem can be formulated as a statistical inference problem and we derive the belief propagation algorithm as a solver for trust prediction. The model and algorithm are tested using datasets from Epinions and Ciao, by which performance advantages over the previous algorithms are demonstrated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24105","fieldValue":"ACM"}
