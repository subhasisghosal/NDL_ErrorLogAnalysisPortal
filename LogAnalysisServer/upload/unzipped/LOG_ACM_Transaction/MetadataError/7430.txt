In this paper, we present a mechanism that lets the network converge to its optimal forwarding state without risking any transient loops and the related packet loss. The mechanism is based on an ordering of the updates of the forwarding tables of the routers. Our solution can be used in the case of a planned change in the state of a set of links and in the case of unpredictable changes when combined with a local protection scheme. The supported topology changes are link transitions from up to down, down to up, and updates of link metrics. Finally, we show by simulations that sub-second loop-free convergence is possible on a large Tier-1 ISP network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9670","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9670","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9670","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1874","fieldValue":"Khan, Samira M"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1874","fieldValue":"Jimnez, Daniel A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1874","fieldValue":" Inclusive caches have been widely used in Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) to simplify cache coherence. However, they have poor performance compared with noninclusive caches not only because of the limited capacity of the entire cache hierarchy but also due to ignorance of temporal locality of the Last-Level Cache (LLC). Blocks that are highly referenced (referred to as hot blocks) are always hit in higher-level caches (e.g., L1 cache) and are rarely referenced in the LLC. Therefore, they become replacement victims in the LLC. Due to the inclusion property, blocks evicted from the LLC have to also be invalidated from higher-level caches. Invalidation of hot blocks from the entire cache hierarchy introduces costly off-chip misses that makes the inclusive cache perform poorly. Neither blocks that are highly referenced in the LLC nor blocks that are highly referenced in higher-level caches should be the LLC replacement victims. We propose temporal-based multilevel correlating cache replacement for inclusive caches to evict blocks in the LLC that are also not hot in higher-level caches using correlated temporal information acquired from all levels of a cache hierarchy with minimal overhead. Invalidation of these blocks does not hurt the performance. By contrast, replacing them as early as possible with useful blocks helps improve cache performance. Based on our experiments, in a dual-core CMP, an inclusive cache with temporal-based multilevel correlating cache replacement significantly outperforms an inclusive cache with traditional LRU replacement by yielding an average speedup of 12.7&percnt;, which is comparable to an enhanced noninclusive cache, while requiring less than 1&percnt; of storage overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1874","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1874","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9671","fieldValue":" Lately, it has been proposed to use shortest path first routing to implement Traffic Engineering in IP networks. The idea is to set the link weights so that the shortest paths, and the traffic thereof, follow the paths designated by the operator. Clearly, only certain shortest path representable path sets can be used in this setting, that is, paths which become shortest paths over some appropriately chosen positive, integer-valued link weights. Our main objective in this paper is to distill and unify the theory of shortest path representability under the umbrella of a novel flow-theoretic framework. In the first part of the paper, we introduce our framework and state a descriptive necessary and sufficient condition to characterize shortest path representable paths. Unfortunately, traditional methods to calculate the corresponding link weights usually produce a bunch of superfluous shortest paths, often leading to congestion along the unconsidered paths. Thus, the second part of the paper is devoted to reducing the number of paths in a representation to the bare minimum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an algorithm is proposed, which is not only able to find a minimal representation in polynomial time, but also assures link weight integrality. Moreover, we give a necessary and sufficient condition to the existence of a one-to-one mapping between a path set and its shortest path representation. However, as revealed by our simulation studies, this condition seems overly restrictive and instead, minimal representations prove much more beneficial"}
