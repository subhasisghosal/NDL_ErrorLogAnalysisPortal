Unlike a BS, an RN is not directly connected to the backbone. Rather, each RN is associated with a donor BS, to which it is connected through the OFDMA wireless link. A very important task in the operation of a wireless network is packet scheduling. In a network with RNs, such scheduling decisions must be made in each cell not only for the BS, but also for the RNs. Because the scheduler in a network with RNs must take into account the transmission resources of the BS and the RNs, it needs to find a feasible schedule that does not exceed the resources of a multidimensional resource pool. This makes the scheduling problem computationally harder than in a network without RNs. In this paper, we define and study the packet-level scheduling problem for a network with RNs. This problem is not only NP-hard, but also admits no efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme. To solve it, we propose an efficient algorithm with a performance guarantee and a simple water-filling heuristic. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first packet-level scheduling algorithm that provides a performance guarantee for a network with RNs. Using simulations, we evaluate our new algorithms and show that they perform very well."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10829","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10829","fieldValue":"OFDMA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10829","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10829","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10830","fieldValue":" A geometric model of a physical network affected by a disaster is proposed and analyzed using integral geometry (geometric probability). This analysis provides a theoretical method of evaluating performance metrics, such as the probability of maintaining connectivity, and a network design rule that can make the network robust against disasters. The proposed model is of when the disaster area is much larger than the part of the network in which we are interested. Performance metrics, such as the probability of maintaining connectivity, are explicitly given by linear functions of the perimeter length of convex hulls determined by physical routes. The derived network design rule includes the following: 1) reducing the convex hull of the physical route reduces the expected number of nodes that cannot connect to the destination; 2) the probability of maintaining the connectivity of two nodes on a loop cannot be changed by changing the physical route of that loop; 3) the effect of introducing a loop is identical to that of a single physical route implemented by the straight-line route."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10830","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10830","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10830","fieldValue":"ACM"}
