We discuss a set of principles that have guided the design of the Internet, called the end-to-end arguments, and we conclude that there is a risk that the range of new requirements now emerging could have the consequence of compromising the Internet's original design principles. Were this to happen, the Internet might lose some of its key features, in particular its ability to support new and unanticipated applications. We link this possible outcome to a number of trends: the rise of new stakeholders in the Internet, in particular Internet service providers; new government interests; the changing motivations of a growing user base; and the tension between the demand for trustworthy overall operation and the inability to trust the behavior of individual users."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24258","fieldValue":"ISP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24259","fieldValue":" This article describes XRel, a novel approach for storage and retrieval of XML documents using relational databases. In this approach, an XML document is decomposed into nodes on the basis of its tree structure and stored in relational tables according to the node type, with path information from the root to each node. XRel enables us to store XML documents using a fixed relational schema without any information about DTDs and also to utilize indices such as the B+-tree and the R-tree supported by database management systems. Thus, XRel does not need any extension of relational databases for storing XML documents. For processing XML queries, we present an algorithm for translating a core subset of XPath expressions into SQL queries. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through several experiments using actual XML documents."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1250","fieldValue":" Firewalls are critical components of network security and have been widely deployed for protecting private networks. A firewall determines whether to accept or discard a packet that passes through it based on its policy. However, most real-life firewalls have been plagued with policy faults, which either allow malicious traffic or block legitimate traffic. Due to the complexity of firewall policies, manually locating the faults of a firewall policy and further correcting them are difficult. Automatically correcting the faults of a firewall policy is an important and challenging problem. In this article, we first propose a fault model for firewall policies including five types of faults. For each type of fault, we present an automatic correction technique. Second, we propose the first systematic approach that employs these five techniques to automatically correct all or part of the misclassified packets of a faulty firewall policy. Third, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results show that our approach is effective to correct a faulty firewall policy with three of these types of faults."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1250","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1250","fieldValue":"ACM"}
