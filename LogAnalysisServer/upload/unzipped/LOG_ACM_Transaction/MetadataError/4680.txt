However, the state of the art in design and evaluation of data centers require designers to be expertly familiar with a prohibitively large number of domain-specific design tools that necessitate user intervention in each step of the design process. This is due to the lack of a holistic data center design tool. To fill this gap, this article presents an iterative green data center design framework, the Green Data Center Simulator (GDCSim), for the design and development of energy-efficient data centers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25089","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25089","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25090","fieldValue":"Bisset, Keith R"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25090","fieldValue":"Marathe, Madhav V"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25090","fieldValue":" We describe the design and prototype implementation of Indemics (&lowbar;Interactive; Epi&lowbar;demic; &lowbar;Simulation;)â\u20AC\u201Da modeling environment utilizing high-performance computing technologies for supporting complex epidemic simulations. Indemics can support policy analysts and epidemiologists interested in planning and control of pandemics. Indemics goes beyond traditional epidemic simulations by providing a simple and powerful way to represent and analyze policy-based as well as individual-based adaptive interventions. Users can also stop the simulation at any point, assess the state of the simulated system, and add additional interventions. Indemics is available to end-users via a web-based interface. Detailed performance analysis shows that Indemics greatly enhances the capability and productivity of simulating complex intervention strategies with a marginal decrease in performance. We also demonstrate how Indemics was applied in some real case studies where complex interventions were implemented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25090","fieldValue":"ACM"}
