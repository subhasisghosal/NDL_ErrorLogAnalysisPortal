In this article, we target embedded CMPs, and propose a novel Hybrid Scratch Pad Memory (HSPM) architecture which consists of SRAM and NVM to take advantage of the ultra-low leakage power, high density of NVM, and fast access of SRAM. A novel data allocation algorithm as well as an algorithm to determine the NVM\/SRAM ratio for the novel HSPM architecture are proposed. The experimental results show that the data allocation algorithm can reduce the memory access time by 33.51&percnt; and the dynamic energy consumption by 16.81&percnt; on average for the HSPM architecture when compared with a greedy algorithm. The NVM\/SRAM size determination algorithm can further reduce the memory access time by 14.7&percnt; and energy consumption by 20.1&percnt; on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6788","fieldValue":"MRAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6788","fieldValue":"NVM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6788","fieldValue":"PCM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6788","fieldValue":"SPM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6788","fieldValue":"Management and optimization for nonvolatile memory-based hybrid scratchpad memory on multicore embedded processors"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6788","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6788","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6789","fieldValue":"Han, Dong-Guk"}
