In their seminal paper IEEE Trans. Autom. Control, vol. 37, no. 12, pp. 1936-1948, Tassiulas and Ephremides introduced Maximum Weighted Scheduling, a centralized resource sharing algorithm, and proved its optimality. Since then, there have been extensive research efforts to devise distributed implementations of this algorithm. Recently, distributed adaptive CSMA scheduling schemes have been proposed and shown to be optimal, without the need of message passing among transmitters. However, their analysis relies on the assumption that interference can be accurately modeled by a simple interference graph. In this paper, we consider the more realistic and challenging signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio SINR interference model. We present distributed scheduling algorithms that: 1 are optimal under the SINR interference model; and 2 do not require any message passing. These algorithms are based on a combination of a simple and efficient power allocation strategy referred to as Power Packing and randomization techniques. The optimality of our algorithms is illustrated in various traffic scenarios using numerical experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10993","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10993","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10993","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10994","fieldValue":" We study multihop networks with flow-scheduling constraints, no constraints on simultaneous activation of different links, potentially multiple source-destination routes, and a mix of heavy-tailed and light-tailed traffic. In this setting, we analyze the delay performance of the widely studied class of Back-Pressure scheduling policies, known for their throughput optimality property, using as a performance criterion the notion of delay stability, i.e., whether the expected end-to-end delay in steady state is finite. Our analysis highlights the significance of â\u20ACœbottleneck links,â\u20AC? i.e., links that are allowed to serve the source queues of heavy-tailed flows. The main idea is that traffic that has to pass through bottleneck links experiences large delays under Back-Pressure. By means of simple examples, we provide insights into how the network topology, the routing constraints, and the link capacities may facilitate or hinder the ability of light-tailed flows to avoid bottlenecks. Our delay-stability analysis is greatly simplified by the use of fluid approximations, allowing us to derive analytical results that would have been hard to obtain through purely stochastic arguments. Finally, we show how to achieve the best performance with respect to the delay stability criterion, by using a parameterized version of the Back-Pressure policy."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/10994","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Modiano, Eytan; Tsitsiklis, John N.); Lab. for Inf. &amp; Decision Syst., Massachusetts Inst. of Technol., Cambridge, MA, USA (Modiano, Eytan; Tsitsiklis, John N.); Dept. of Econ. &amp; Bus., Univ.
