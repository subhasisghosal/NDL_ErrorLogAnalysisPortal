Since the first ACL workshop on MWEs 12 years ago in Sapporo, Japan, much has been discussed, proposed, experimented, evaluated and argued about MWEs. And yet, they deserve the publication of a whole special issue of the ACM Transactions on Speech and Language Processing.

This study follows others in seeking syntactic or lexical semantic factors correlated with the acceptability of these constructions. In particular, following recent work showing certain semantic verb class features to improve SVN classification [Tu and Roth 2011], we explore the possibility that support verbs and the verbal roots of nominalizations in acceptable SVN pairs are clustered according to the classes of Levin [1993]. We compare the compatibility correlation of these results with those of the Aktionsart-class-based proposal of Barrett and Davis [2002]. We find the evidence that Levin classes are a factor in the acceptability of SVN constructions to be equivocal, and conclude with a discussion of the reasons for this finding."}
