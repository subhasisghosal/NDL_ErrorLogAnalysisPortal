One such task is finding where an algebraic function of the solution (an event function) has a root (an event occurs). This is a task which is difficult both in theory and in software practice. For certain useful kinds of event functions, it is possible to avoid two fundamental difficulties. It is described how to achieve the reliable solutions of such problems in a way that allows the capability to be grafted onto popular codes for the initial value problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18667","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18667","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18668","fieldValue":" The algorithms used by the IBM Israel Scientific Center for the elementary mathematical library using the IEEE standard for binary floating point arithmetic are described. The algorithms are based on the â\u20ACœaccurate tables method.â\u20AC? This methodology achieves high performance and produces very accurate results. It overcomes one of the main problems encountered in elementary mathematical functions computations: achieving last bit accuracy. The results obtained are correctly rounded for almost all arguement values. Our main idea in the accurate tables method is to use â\u20ACœnonstandard tables,â\u20AC? which are different from the natural tables of equally spaced points in which the rounding error prevents obtaining last bit accuracy. In order to achieve a small error we use the following idea: Perturb the original, equally spaced, points in such a way that the table value (or tables values in case we need several tables) will be very close to numbers which can be exactly represented by the computer (much closer than the usual double percision representation). Thus we were able to control the error introduced by the computer representation of real numbers and extended the accuracy without actually using extended precision arithmetic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18668","fieldValue":"ACM"}
