{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7546","fieldValue":" Many multi-agent settings require that agents identify appropriate partners or teammates with whom to work on tasks. When selecting potential partners, agents may benefit from obtaining information about the alternatives, for instance, through gossip (i.e., by consulting others) or reputation systems. When information is uncertain and associated with cost, deciding on the amount of information needed is a hard optimization problem. This article defines a statistical model, the Information-Acquisition Source Utility model (IASU), by which agents, operating in an uncertain world, can determine (1) which information sources they should request for information, and (2) the amount of information to collect about potential partners from each source. To maximize the expected gain from the choice, IASU computes the utility of choosing a partner by estimating the benefit of additional information. The article presents empirical studies through a simulation domain as well as a real-world domain of restaurants. We compare the IASU model to other relevant models and show that the use of the IASU model significantly increases agents' overall utility."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7546","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7546","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7547","fieldValue":" In the field of visual art, metaphor is a way to communicate meaning to the viewer. We present a computational system for communicating visual metaphor that can identify adjectives for describing an image based on a low-level visual feature representation of the image. We show that the system can use this visual-linguistic association to render source images that convey the meaning of adjectives in a way consistent with human understanding. Our conclusions are based on a detailed analysis of how the system's artifacts cluster, how these clusters correspond to the semantic relationships of adjectives as documented in WordNet, and how these clusters correspond to human opinion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7548","fieldValue":" Many innovative location-based services have been established to offer users greater convenience in their everyday lives. These services usually cannot map user's physical locations into semantic names automatically. The semantic names of locations provide important context for mobile recommendations and advertisements. In this article, we proposed a novel location naming approach which can automatically provide semantic names for users given their locations and time. In particular, when a user opens a GPS device and submits a query with her physical location and time, she will be returned the most appropriate semantic name. In our approach, we drew an analogy between location naming and local search, and designed a local search framework to propose a spatiotemporal and user preference (STUP) model for location naming. STUP combined three components, user preference (UP), spatial preference (SP), and temporal preference (TP), by leveraging learning-to-rank techniques. We evaluated STUP on 466,190 check-ins of 5,805 users from Shanghai and 135,052 check-ins of 1,361 users from Beijing. The results showed that SP was most effective among three components and that UP can provide personalized semantic names, and thus it was a necessity for location naming. Although TP was not as discriminative as the others, it can still be beneficial when integrated with SP and UP. Finally, according to the experimental results, STUP outperformed the proposed baselines and returned accurate semantic names for 23.6&percnt; and 26.6&percnt; of the testing queries from Beijing and Shanghai, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7548","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7548","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7549","fieldValue":" Web portal services have become an important medium to deliver digital content (e.g. news, advertisements, etc.) to Web users in a timely fashion. To attract more users to various content modules on the Web portal, it is necessary to design a recommender system that can effectively achieve Web portal content optimization by automatically estimating content item attractiveness and relevance to user interests. The state-of-the-art online learning methodology adapts dedicated pointwise models to independently estimate the attractiveness score for each candidate content item. Although such pointwise models can be easily adapted for online recommendation, there still remain a few critical problems. First, this pointwise methodology fails to use invaluable user preferences between content items. Moreover, the performance of pointwise models decreases drastically when facing the problem of sparse learning samples. To address these problems, we propose exploring a new dynamic pairwise learning methodology for Web portal content optimization in which we exploit dynamic user preferences extracted based on users' actions on portal services to compute the attractiveness scores of content items. In this article, we introduce two specific pairwise learning algorithms, a straightforward graph-based algorithm and a formalized Bayesian modeling one. Experiments on large-scale data from a commercial Web portal demonstrate the significant improvement of pairwise methodologies over the baseline pointwise models. Further analysis illustrates that our new pairwise learning approaches can benefit personalized recommendation more than pointwise models, since the data sparsity is more critical for personalized content optimization."}
