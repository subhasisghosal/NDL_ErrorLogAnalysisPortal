We improve their algorithm to a 0.8776-approximation. As Max Bisection is hard to approximate within $Î±_GW + Îµ &approx; 0.8786 under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC), our algorithm is nearly optimal. We conjecture that Max Bisection is approximable within Î±GW âˆ\u2019 Îµ, that is, that the bisection constraint (essentially) does not make Max Cut harder. We also obtain an optimal algorithm (assuming the UGC) for the analogous variant of Max 2-Sat. Our approximation ratio for this problem exactly matches the optimal approximation ratio for Max 2-Sat, that is, Î±LLZ$ + Îµ &approx; 0.9401, showing that the bisection constraint does not make Max 2-Sat harder. This improves on a 0.93-approximation for this problem from Raghavendra and Tan."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2733","fieldValue":"ACM"}
