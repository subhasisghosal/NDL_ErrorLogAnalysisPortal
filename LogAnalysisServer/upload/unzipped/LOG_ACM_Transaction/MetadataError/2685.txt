We have previously proposed an approach for dealing with this task by processing performance data of the targeted software. This approach has been tested using a customized implementation referred to as PYTHIA. This experience made us realize the complexity of the algorithmic discovery of knowledge from performance data and of the management of these data together with the discovered knowledge. To address this issue, we created PYTHIA-IIâ\u20AC\u201Da modular framework and system which combines a general knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) methodology and recommender system technologies to provide advice about scientific software\/hardware artifacts. The functionality and effectiveness of the system is demonstrated for two existing performance studies using sets of software for solving partial differential equations. From the end-user perspective, PYTHIA-II allows users to specify the problem to be solved and their computational objectives. In turn, PYTHIA-II (i) selects the software available for the user's problem (ii) suggests parameter values, and (iii) assesses the recommendation provided. PYTHIA-II provides all the necessary facilities to set up database schemas for testing suites and associated performance data in order to test sets of software. Moreover, it allows easy interfacing of alternative data mining and recommendation facilities. PYTHIA-II is an open-ended system implemented on public domain software and has been used for performance evaluation in several different problem domains."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18972","fieldValue":"PYTHIA-II: a knowledge\/database system for managing performance data and recommending scientific software"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18972","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18972","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18973","fieldValue":" In this paper we extend previous work in mining recommendation spaces based on symbolic problem features to PDE problems with continuous-valued attributes. We identify the research issues in mining such spaces, present a dynamic programming algorithm form the data-mining literature, and describe how a priori domain metaknowledge can be used to control the complexity of induction. A visualization aid for continuous-valued recommendation spaces is also outlined. Two case studies are presented to illustrate our approach and tools: (i) a comparison of an iterative and a direct linear system solver on nearly singular problems, and (ii) a comparison of two iterative solvers on problems posed on nonrectangular domains. Both case studies involve continuously varying problem and method parameters which strongly influence the choice of best algorithm in particular cases. By mining the results from thousands of PDE solves, we can gain valuable insight into the relative performance of these methods on similar problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18973","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18973","fieldValue":"ACM"}
