It becomes increasingly important for storage systems to be able to select the matched caching policy dynamically under varying workloads. This article proposes SOPA, a cache framework to adaptively select the matched policy and perform policy switches in storage systems. SOPA encapsulates the functions of a caching policy into a module, and enables online policy switching by policy reconstruction. SOPA then selects the policy matched with the workload dynamically by collecting and analyzing access traces. To reduce the decision-making cost, SOPA proposes an asynchronous decision making process. The simulation experiments show that no single caching policy performed well under all of the different workloads. With SOPA, a storage system could select the appropriate policy for different workloads. The real-system evaluation results show that SOPA reduced the average response time by up to 20.3&percnt; and 11.9&percnt; compared with LRU and ARC, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20993","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20993","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3005","fieldValue":"Chan, Kwop-Ping"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3005","fieldValue":" We propose an adaptive Bayesian hidden Markov model for fully unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) induction. The proposed model with its inference algorithm has two extensions to the first-order Bayesian HMM with Dirichlet priors. First our algorithm infers the optimal number of hidden states from the training corpus rather than fixes the dimensionality of state space beforehand. The second extension studies the Chinese unknown word processing module which measures similarities from both morphological properties and context distribution. Experimental results showed that both of these two extensions can help to find the optimal categories for Chinese in terms of both unsupervised clustering metrics and grammar induction accuracies on the Chinese Treebank."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3005","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3005","fieldValue":"ACM"}
