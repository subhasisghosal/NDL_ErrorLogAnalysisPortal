Consisting of natural language processing and IE modules, the system has integrated several new features, including the capability of processing full-text articles and generalizability towards different post-translational modifications (PTMs). To evaluate the system, sets of abstracts and full-text articles, containing a variety of textual expressions, were annotated. On the abstract corpus, the system achieved F-scores of 0.91, 0.92, and 0.95 for kinases, substrates, and sites, respectively. The corresponding scores on the full-text corpus were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.92. It was additionally evaluated on the corpus of the 2013 BioNLP-ST GE task, and achieved an F-score of 0.87 for the phosphorylation core task, improving upon the results previously reported on the corpus. Full-scale processing of all abstracts in MEDLINE and all articles in PubMed Central Open Access Subset has demonstrated scalability for mining rich information in literature, enabling its adoption for biocuration and for knowledge discovery. The new system is generalizable and it will be adapted to tackle other major PTM types. RLIMS-P 2.0 online system is available online (http:\/\/proteininformationresource.org\/rlimsp\/) and the developed corpora are available from iProLINK (http:\/\/proteininformationresource.org\/iprolink\/)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5180","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5180","fieldValue":"RLIMS-P 2.0: a generalizable rule-based information extraction system for literature mining of protein phosphorylation information"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5180","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5180","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5181","fieldValue":"Xiong, Zheng-Mei"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5181","fieldValue":" Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disease with symptoms of aging at a very early age. Its molecular basis is not entirely clear, although profound gene expression changes have been reported, and there are some known and other presumed overlaps with normal aging process. Identification of genes with aging - or HGPS-associated expression changes is thus an important problem. However, standard regression approaches are currently unsuitable for this task due to limited sample sizes, thus motivating development of alternative approaches. Here, we report a novel iterative multiple regression approach that leverages co-expressed gene clusters to identify gene clusters whose expression co-varies with age and\/or HGPS. We have applied our approach to novel RNA-seq profiles in fibroblast cell cultures at three different cellular ages, both from HGPS patients and normal samples. After establishing the robustness of our approach, we perform a comparative investigation of biological processes underlying normal aging and HGPS. Our results recapitulate previously known processes underlying aging as well as suggest numerous unique processes underlying aging and HGPS. The approach could also be useful in detecting phenotype-dependent co-expression gene clusters in other contexts with limited sample sizes."}
