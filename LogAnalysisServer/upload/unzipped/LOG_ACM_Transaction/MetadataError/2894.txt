{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19452","fieldValue":" Marsaglia proposed xorshift generators are a class of very fast, good-quality pseudorandom number generators. Subsequent analysis by Panneton and L'Ecuyer has lowered the expectations raised by Marsaglia's article, showing several weaknesses of such generators. Nonetheless, many of the weaknesses of xorshift generators fade away if their result is scrambled by a nonlinear operation (as originally suggested by Marsaglia). In this article we explore the space of possible generators obtained by multiplying the result of a xorshift generator by a suitable constant. We sample generators at 100 points of their state space and obtain detailed statistics that lead us to choices of parameters that improve on the current ones. We then explore for the first time the space of high-dimensional xorshift generators, following another suggestion in Marsaglia's article, finding choices of parameters providing periods of length $2^1024 âˆ\u2019 1 and 24096$ âˆ\u2019 1. The resulting generators are of extremely high quality, faster than current similar alternatives, and generate long-period sequences passing strong statistical tests using only eight logical operations, one addition, and one multiplication by a constant."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19452","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Universit&#224; degli Studi di Milano, Italy (Vigna, Sebastiano)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19453","fieldValue":" Engineering, scientific, and financial applications often require the simultaneous solution of a large number of independent tridiagonal systems of equations with varying coefficients. Since the number of systems is large enough to offer considerable parallelism on manycore systems, the choice between different tridiagonal solution algorithms, such as Thomas, Cyclic Reduction (CR) or Parallel Cyclic Reduction (PCR) needs to be reexamined. This work investigates the optimal choice of tridiagonal algorithm for CPU, Intel MIC, and NVIDIA GPU with a focus on minimizing the amount of data transfer to and from the main memory using novel algorithms and the register-blocking mechanism, and maximizing the achieved bandwidth. It also considers block tridiagonal solutions, which are sometimes required in Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) applications. A novel work-sharing and register blocking--based Thomas solver is also presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19453","fieldValue":"CPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19453","fieldValue":"CUDA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19453","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19453","fieldValue":"MIC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19453","fieldValue":"ACM"}
