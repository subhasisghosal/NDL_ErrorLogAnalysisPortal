This process is labor intensive and time consuming, primarily because lighting artists receive poor feedback from existing tools: interactive previews have very poor quality, while final-quality images often take hours to render.This paper presents an interactive cinematic lighting system used in the production of computer-animated feature films containing environments of very high complexity, in which surface and light appearances are described using procedural RenderMan shaders. Our system provides lighting artists with high-quality previews at interactive framerates with only small approximations compared to the final rendered images. This is accomplished by combining numerical estimation of surface response, image-space caching, deferred shading, and the computational power of modern graphics hardware.Our system has been successfully used in the production of two feature-length animated films, dramatically accelerating lighting tasks. In our experience interactivity fundamentally changes an artist's workflow, improving both productivity and artistic expressiveness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15520","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2471","fieldValue":"Schulman, Leonard J"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2471","fieldValue":" A set of k balls $B_1, â\u20AC¦,Bk in a Euclidean space is said to cover a collection of lines if every line intersects some ball. We consider the k-center problem for lines in high-dimensional space: Given a set of n lines $^l&equals; &lbrace;l1,â\u20AC¦,ln$ in Rd$, find k balls of minimum radius which cover l. We present a 2-approximation algorithm for the cases k &equals; 2, 3 of this problem, having running time quasi-linear in the number of lines and the dimension of the ambient space. Our result for 3-clustering is strongly based on a new result in discrete geometry that may be of independent interest: a Helly-type theorem for collections of axis-parallel â\u20ACœcrossesâ\u20AC? in the plane. The family of crosses does not have finite Helly number in the usual sense. Our Helly theorem is of a new type: it depends on Îµ-contracting the sets. In statistical practice, data is often incompletely specified; we consider lines as the most elementary case of incompletely specified data points. Clustering of data is a key primitive in nonparametric statistics. Our results provide a way of performing this primitive on incomplete data, as well as imputing the missing values."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2471","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-center"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2471","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-center"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2471","fieldValue":"ACM"}
