An unroutable design is not useful even though it closes on all other design metrics. Fast design closure can only be achieved by accurately evaluating whether a design is routable or not early in the design cycle. Lately, it has become common to use a â\u20ACœlight modeâ\u20AC? version of a global router to quickly evaluate the routability of a given placement. This approach suffers from three weaknesses: (i) it does not adequately model local routing resources, which can cause incorrect routability predictions that are only detected late, during detailed routing; (ii) the congestion maps obtained by it tend to have isolated hotspots surrounded by noncongested spots, called â\u20ACœnoisy hotspotsâ\u20AC?, which further affects the accuracy in routability evaluation; and (iii) the metrics used to represent congestion may yield numbers that do not provide sufficient intuition to the designer, and moreover, they may often fail to predict the routability accurately. This article presents solutions to these issues. First, we propose three approaches to model local routing resources. Second, we propose a smoothing technique to reduce the number of noisy hotspots and obtain a more accurate routability evaluation result. Finally, we develop a new metric which represents congestion maps with higher fidelity. We apply the proposed techniques to several industrial circuits and demonstrate that one can better predict and evaluate design routability and that congestion mitigation tools can perform much better to improve the design routability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13374","fieldValue":" This article studies the generation of low-power skewed-load tests such that the signal transitions (and line values) they create during their fast functional clock cycles match those of functional broadside tests. Functional broadside tests create functional operation conditions during their fast functional clock cycles. As a result, the signal transitions that occur during these clock cycles can also occur during functional operation. The procedure described in this article matches these signal-transitions on a line-by-line basis when generating low-power skewed-load tests. The procedure accepts a functional broadside test set for transition faults. In one of its basic steps, the procedure modifies a functional broadside test into a skewed-load test. This allows it to retain many of the signal transitions (and line values) of the functional broadside test in the skewed-load test. Experimental results for benchmark circuits demonstrate the extent to which it is possible to match the signal-transitions of skewed-load tests with those of functional broadside tests while achieving the high transition fault coverage that is typical of skewed-load tests."}
