The counting hierarchy is the analogue of the polynomial hierarchy, the building block being Probabilistic polynomial time PP instead of NP. We show that the extension of first-order logic by second-order majority quantifiers of all arities describes exactly the problems in the counting hierarchy. We also consider extending the characterization to general proportional quantifiers $$Q^k_r$ interpreted as â\u20ACœmore than an r-fraction of k-ary relationsâ\u20AC?.

Unfortunately, these inclusive permissions allow a compromised high-privileged software layer to perform arbitrary malicious activities. In this article, our goal is to prevent attacks that cross system layers while maintaining the abilities of system software to manage the system and allocate resources. In particular, we present a hardware-supported page permission framework for physical pages that is based on the concept of noninclusive sets of memory permissions for different layers of system software (such as hypervisors, operating systems, and user-level applications). Instead of viewing privilege levels as an ordered hierarchy with each successive level being more privileged, we view them as distinct levels each with its own set of permissions. In order to enable system software to manage client processes, we define a set of legal permission transitions that support resource allocation but preserve security. We show that the model prevents a range of recent attacks. We also show that it can be implemented with negligible performance overhead (both at load time and at runtime), low hardware complexity, and minimal changes to the commodity OS and hypervisor code."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2054","fieldValue":"ACM"}
