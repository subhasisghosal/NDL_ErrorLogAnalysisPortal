The difficulty of scaling a search to large datasets explains to a great extent why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following unintuitive fact: in large datasets we can exactly search under Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We explain how our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problems such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. Moreover, we show how our ideas allow us to efficiently support the uniform scaling distance measure, a measure whose utility seems to be underappreciated, but which we demonstrate here. In addition to mining massive datasets with up to one trillion datapoints, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and\/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7950","fieldValue":"Addressing Big Data Time Series: Mining Trillions of Time Series Subsequences Under Dynamic Time Warping"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7951","fieldValue":"Yu, Philip S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7951","fieldValue":" Real-world, multiple-typed objects are often interconnected, forming heterogeneous information networks. A major challenge for link-based clustering in such networks is their potential to generate many different results, carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. In order to generate desired clustering, we propose to use meta-path, a path that connects object types via a sequence of relations, to control clustering with distinct semantics. Nevertheless, it is easier for a user to provide a few examples (seeds) than a weighted combination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus, we propose to integrate meta-path selection with user-guided clustering to cluster objects in networks, where a user first provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster as guidance. Then the system learns the weight for each meta-path that is consistent with the clustering result implied by the guidance, and generates clusters under the learned weights of meta-paths. A probabilistic approach is proposed to solve the problem, and an effective and efficient iterative algorithm, PathSelClus, is proposed to learn the model, where the clustering quality and the meta-path weights mutually enhance each other. Our experiments with several clustering tasks in two real networks and one synthetic network demonstrate the power of the algorithm in comparison with the baselines."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7951","fieldValue":"PathSelClus: Integrating Meta-Path Selection with User-Guided Object Clustering in Heterogeneous Information Networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7951","fieldValue":"ACM"}
