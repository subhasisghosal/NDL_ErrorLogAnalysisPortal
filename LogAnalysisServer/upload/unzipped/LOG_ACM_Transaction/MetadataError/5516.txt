{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4787","fieldValue":" A Maximum Agreement SubTree (MAST) is a largest subtree common to a set of trees and serves as a summary of common substructure in the trees. A single MAST can be misleading, however, since there can be an exponential number of MASTs, and two MASTs for the same tree set do not even necessarily share any leaves. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the Kernel Agreement SubTree (KAST), which is the summary of the common substructure in all MASTs, and show that it can be calculated in polynomial time (for trees with bounded degree). Suppose the input trees represent competing hypotheses for a particular phylogeny. We explore the utility of the KAST as a method to discern the common structure of confidence, and as a measure of how confident we are in a given tree set. We also show the trend of the KAST, as compared to other consensus methods, on the set of all trees visited during a Bayesian analysis of flatworm genomes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4787","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4788","fieldValue":"Moret, Bernard M E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4788","fieldValue":" The experimental determination of transcriptional regulatory networks in the laboratory remains difficult and time-consuming, while computational methods to infer these networks provide only modest accuracy. The latter can be attributed partly to the limitations of a single-organism approach. Computational biology has long used comparative and evolutionary approaches to extend the reach and accuracy of its analyses. In this paper, we describe ProPhyC, a probabilistic phylogenetic model and associated inference algorithms, designed to improve the inference of regulatory networks for a family of organisms by using known evolutionary relationships among these organisms. ProPhyC can be used with various network evolutionary models and any existing inference method. Extensive experimental results on both biological and synthetic data confirm that our model (through its associated refinement algorithms) yields substantial improvement in the quality of inferred networks over all current methods. We also compare ProPhyC with a transfer learning approach we design. This approach also uses phylogenetic relationships while inferring regulatory networks for a family of organisms. Using similar input information but designed in a very different framework, this transfer learning approach does not perform better than ProPhyC, which indicates that ProPhyC makes good use of the evolutionary information."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4788","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4788","fieldValue":"Regulatory networks, network inference, evolution, phylogenetic relationships, ancestral network, refinement, gene duplication, evolutionary model, evolutionary history, reconciliation, maximum likelihood, transfer learning."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4788","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4788","fieldValue":"ACM"}
