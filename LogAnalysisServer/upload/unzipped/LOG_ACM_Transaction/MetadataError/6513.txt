Using criminal offense records as an example, we employ cross-correlation measures, eigenvalue spectrum analysis, and results from random matrix theory to identify spatiotemporal patterns on multiple scales. With these techniques, we show that most significant correlation exists on the time scale of weeks and identify clusters of neighborhoods whose crime rates are affected simultaneously by external forces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7362","fieldValue":" Counting craters in remotely sensed images is the only tool that provides relative dating of remote planetary surfaces. Surveying craters requires counting a large amount of small subkilometer craters, which calls for highly efficient automatic crater detection. In this article, we present an integrated framework on autodetection of subkilometer craters with boosting and transfer learning. The framework contains three key components. First, we utilize mathematical morphology to efficiently identify crater candidates, the regions of an image that can potentially contain craters. Only those regions occupying relatively small portions of the original image are the subjects of further processing. Second, we extract and select image texture features, in combination with supervised boosting ensemble learning algorithms, to accurately classify crater candidates into craters and noncraters. Third, we integrate transfer learning into boosting, to enhance detection performance in the regions where surface morphology differs from what is characterized by the training set. Our framework is evaluated on a large test image of 37,500 Ã\u2014 56,250 $m^2$ on Mars, which exhibits a heavily cratered Martian terrain characterized by nonuniform surface morphology. Empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed crater detection framework can achieve an F1 score above 0.85, a significant improvement over the other crater detection algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7363","fieldValue":"Yorke-Smith, Neil"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7363","fieldValue":" In a world of electronic calendars, the prospect of intelligent, personalized time management assistance seems a plausible and desirable application of AI. PTIME (Personalized Time Management) is a learning cognitive assistant agent that helps users handle email meeting requests, reserve venues, and schedule events. PTIME is designed to unobtrusively learn scheduling preferences, adapting to its user over time. The agent allows its user to flexibly express requirements for new meetings, as they would to an assistant. It interfaces with commercial enterprise calendaring platforms, and it operates seamlessly with users who do not have PTIME. This article overviews the system design and describes the models and technical advances required to satisfy the competing needs of preference modeling and elicitation, constraint reasoning, and machine learning. We further report on a multifaceted evaluation of the perceived usefulness of the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7363","fieldValue":"ACM"}
