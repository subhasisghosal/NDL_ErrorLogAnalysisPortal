A mathematical link is derived between the well known multiple-input\/output inverse theorem (MINT) algorithm and channel shortening. The relaxed multichannel least squares (RMCLS) algorithm is then proposed as an efficient realization within the channel shortening paradigm and is shown through experimental results to outperform MINT in the presence of SIEs. While the RMCLS is robust to SIEs, the coloration of the output cannot be controlled. Two extensions to RMCLS are proposed to control the level of coloration and the performances of both extensions are evaluated comparatively. It is shown that both substantially maintain the dereverberation performance and robustness to SIEs obtained from RMCLS while effectively controlling the level of coloration introduced."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3688","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3688","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3689","fieldValue":" This paper presents a study of two acoustic speaker adaptation techniques applied in the context of the subspace Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) for automatic speech recognition (ASR). First, a model space linear regression based approach is presented for adaptation of SGMM state projection vectors and is referred to as subspace vector adaptation (SVA). Second, an easy to implement realization of constrained maximum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) is presented for feature space adaptation in the SGMM. Numerically stable procedures for row-by-row estimation of the regression based transformation matrices are presented for both SVA and CMLLR adaptation. These approaches are applied to SGMM models that are estimated using speaker adaptive training (SAT), a technique for estimating more compact speaker independent acoustic models. Unsupervised speaker adaptation performance is evaluated on conversational and read speech task domains and compared to unsupervised adaptation performance obtained using the hidden Markov model-Gaussian mixture model (HMM-GMM) in ASR. It is shown that the feature space and model space adaptation approaches applied to the SGMM provide complementary reductions in word error rate (WER) and provide lower WERs than that obtained using CMLLR adaptation for the HMM-GMM."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3690","fieldValue":" Finite difference solutions to the wave equation are simple and flexible modeling tools for approximating physical systems in audio and room acoustics. Each model is characterized by a matrix operator and the time-stepping solution by a sequence of powers of the matrix. Spectral decomposition of representative matrices provide some practical insight into solution behavior and in some cases stability. In addition to computed eigenvalue spectra, pseudospectra provide a description of numerical amplification due to rounding errors in floating point arithmetic. The matrix analysis also shows that certain boundary implementations in non-cuboid geometries can be unstable despite satisfying conditions derived from von Neumann and normal mode analyses."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3690","fieldValue":"ACM"}
