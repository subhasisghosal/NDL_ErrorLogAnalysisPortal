By using the concept of composability, our framework supports modular component development for various networking functions, thereby promoting code reuse. The framework consists of four components: the physical testbed, the module library, the declarative language, and the workbench. Its reference implementation, ProtoStack, developed using semantic web technologies, supports remote experimentation on sensor platform-based infrastructure and is thus well suited also for experimenters who do not possess their own physical experimentation infrastructure. We illustrate how ProtoStack supports research in service-oriented networks and cognitive networking. The cost of increased flexibility and prototyping speed of the protocol stack is paid in terms of increased memory footprint, processing speed, and energy consumption. Compared to the most related noncomposable approach, the CRime library used by ProtoStack has a 16--17&percnt; larger footprint, takes 2.4 times longer to execute an open-send-recv-close sequence, and consumes 1.6&percnt; more power in doing so. Even though with ProtoStack more resources are consumed by the node, the tradeoff in terms of prototyping speed pays off."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21551","fieldValue":" Troubleshooting unresponsive sensor nodes is a significant challenge in remote sensor network deployments. While prior work often targets low-end sensor networks, this article introduces a novel diagnostic tool, called the telediagnostic powertracer, geared for remote high-end sensing systems. Leveraging special properties of high-end systems, this in situ troubleshooting tool uses external power measurements to determine the internal health condition of an unresponsive node and the most likely cause of its failure. We develop our own low-cost power meter with low-bandwidth radio, propose both passive and active sampling schemes to measure the power consumption of the host node, and then report the measurements to a base station, hence allowing remote (i.e., tele-) diagnosis. The tool was deployed and tested in a remote solar-powered sensing system for acoustic and visual environmental monitoring. It was shown to successfully distinguish between several categories of failures that cause unresponsive behavior including energy depletion, antenna damage, radio disconnection, system crashes, and anomalous reboots. It was also able to determine the internal health conditions of an unresponsive node, such as the presence or absence of sensing and data storage activities (for each of multiple applications). The article explores the feasibility of building such a remote diagnostic tool from the standpoint of economy, scale, and diagnostic accuracy. The main novelty lies in its use of power consumption as a side channel, which has more availability than other I\/O ports, to diagnose sensing system failures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21551","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21551","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21552","fieldValue":" There has been considerable interest in distributed source coding (DSC) in recent years, primarily due to its potential contributions to low-power sensor networks. However, two major obstacles pose an existential threat to practical deployment of such techniques: the exponential growth of decoding complexity with network size and coding rates and the critical requirement of resilience to bit errors and erasures, given the severe channel conditions in many wireless sensor network applications. This article proposes a novel, unified approach for large-scale, error\/erasure-resilient DSC that incorporates an optimally designed, nearest neighbor classifier-based decoding framework, where the design explicitly controls performance versus decoding complexity. Motivated by the highly nonconvex nature of the cost function, we present a deterministic annealing-based optimization algorithm for the joint design of the system parameters, which further enhances the performance over the greedy iterative descent technique. Simulation results on both synthetic and real sensor network data provide strong evidence for performance gains compared to other state-of-the-art techniques and may open the door to practical deployment of DSC in large sensor networks. Moreover, the framework provides a principled way to naturally scale to large networks while constraining decoder complexity, thereby enabling performance gains that increase with network size."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21552","fieldValue":"Error\/Erasure-Resilient and Complexity-Constrained Zero-Delay Distributed Coding for Large-Scale Sensor Networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21552","fieldValue":"ACM"}
