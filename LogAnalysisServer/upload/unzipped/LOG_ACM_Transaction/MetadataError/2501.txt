The notion of multiple elimination is introduced here as a modification to the conventional scheme. The motivation is discussed using the k-by-k grid model problem. Experimental results indicate that the modified version retains the fill-reducing property of (and is often better than) the original ordering algorithm and yet requires less computer time. The reduction in ordering time is problem dependent, and for some problems the modified algorithm can run a few times faster than existing implementations of the minimum-degree algorithm. The use of external degree in the algorithm is also introduced."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18463","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18463","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18464","fieldValue":" A recent study by Akl indicates that Mifsud's algorithm, which involves unnecessary searching operations, is the fastest existing combination generator.
