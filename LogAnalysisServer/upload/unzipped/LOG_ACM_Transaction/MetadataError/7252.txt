We show that for N-node P-port bidirectional rings, a minimum number of âŒˆPN\/4âŒ\u2030 wavelengths are required to support all possible connected virtual topologies in a rearrangeably nonblocking fashion, and provide an algorithm that meets this bound using no more than âŒˆPN\/2âŒ\u2030 wavelength converters. This improves over the tight lower bound of âŒˆPN\/3âŒ\u2030 wavelengths required for such rings given in [1] if no wavelength conversion is available. We extend this to the general P-port case where each node i may have a different number of ports, Pi and show that no more than âŒˆÎ£i Pi\/4âŒ\u2030 + 1 wavelengths are required. We then provide a second algorithm that uses more wavelengths yet requires significantly fewer converters. We also develop a method that allows the wavelength converters to be arbitrarily located at any node in the ring. This gives significant flexibility in the design of the networks. For example, all âŒˆPN\/2âŒ\u2030 converters can be collocated at a single hub node, or distributed evenly among the N nodes with min {âŒˆP\/2âŒ\u2030 + 1, P} converters at each node."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9322","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9322","fieldValue":"Efficient routing and wavelength assignment for reconfigurable WDM ring networks with wavelength converters"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9322","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9322","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9323","fieldValue":" In this paper, we analyze the blocking probability of distributed lightpath establishment in wavelength-routed WDM networks by studying the two basic methods: destination-initiated reservation (DIR) and source-initiated reservation (SIR). We discuss three basic types of connection blocking: 1) blocking due to insufficient network capacity; 2) blocking due to outdated information; and 3) blocking due to over-reservation. It is shown that the proposed models are highly accurate for both the DIR and the SIR methods, in both the regular and irregular network topologies, under the whole range of traffic loads."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9323","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
