{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7507","fieldValue":" Processes in the healthcare domain are characterized by coarsely predefined recurring procedures that are flexibly adapted by the personnel to suite-specific situations. In this setting, a workflow management system that gives guidance and documents the personnel's actions can lead to a higher quality of care, fewer mistakes, and higher efficiency. However, most existing workflow management systems enforce rigid inflexible workflows and rely on direct manual input. Both are inadequate for healthcare processes. In particular, direct manual input is not possible in most cases since (1) it would distract the personnel even in critical situations and (2) it would violate fundamental hygiene principles by requiring disinfected doctors and nurses to touch input devices. The solution could be activity recognition systems that use sensor data (e.g., audio and acceleration data) to infer the current activities by the personnel and provide input to a workflow (e.g., informing it that a certain activity is finished now). However, state-of-the-art activity recognition technologies have difficulties in providing reliable information. We describe a comprehensive framework tailored for flexible human-centric healthcare processes that improves the reliability of activity recognition data. We present a set of mechanisms that exploit the application knowledge encoded in workflows in order to reduce the uncertainty of this data, thus enabling unobtrusive robust healthcare workflows. We evaluate our work based on a real-world case study and show that the robustness of unobtrusive healthcare workflows can be increased to an absolute value of up to 91&percnt; (compared to only 12&percnt; with a classical workflow system). This is a major breakthrough that paves the way towards future IT-enabled healthcare systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7507","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7507","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7508","fieldValue":" In healthcare-related studies, individual patient or hospital data are not often publicly available due to privacy restrictions, legal issues, or reporting norms. However, such measures may be provided at a higher or more aggregated level, such as state-level, county-level summaries or averages over health zones, such as hospital referral regions (HRR) or hospital service areas (HSA). Such levels constitute partitions over the underlying individual level data, which may not match the groupings that would have been obtained if one clustered the data based on individual-level attributes. Moreover, treating aggregated values as representatives for the individuals can result in the ecological fallacy. How can one run data mining procedures on such data where different variables are available at different levels of aggregation or granularity&quest; In this article, we seek a better utilization of variably aggregated datasets, which are possibly assembled from different sources. We propose a novel cross-level imputation technique that models the generative process of such datasets using a Bayesian directed graphical model. The imputation is based on the underlying data distribution and is shown to be unbiased. This imputation can be further utilized in a subsequent predictive modeling, yielding improved accuracies. The experimental results using a simulated dataset and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset are provided to illustrate the generality and capabilities of the proposed framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7508","fieldValue":"BRFSS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7509","fieldValue":"Hoens, T Ryan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7509","fieldValue":" One of the concerns patients have when confronted with a medical condition is which physician to trust. Any recommendation system that seeks to answer this question must ensure that any sensitive medical information collected by the system is properly secured. In this article, we codify these privacy concerns in a privacy-friendly framework and present two architectures that realize it: the Secure Processing Architecture (SPA) and the Anonymous Contributions Architecture (ACA). In SPA, patients submit their ratings in a protected form without revealing any information about their data and the computation of recommendations proceeds over the protected data using secure multiparty computation techniques. In ACA, patients submit their ratings in the clear, but no link between a submission and patient data can be made. We discuss various aspects of both architectures, including techniques for ensuring reliability of computed recommendations and system performance, and provide their comparison."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7509","fieldValue":"ACM"}
