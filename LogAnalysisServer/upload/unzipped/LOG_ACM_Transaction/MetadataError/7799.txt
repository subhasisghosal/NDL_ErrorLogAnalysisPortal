{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10413","fieldValue":" Various applications in wireless networks, such as routing and query processing, can be formulated as random walks on graphs. Many results have been obtained for such applications by utilizing the theory of random walks (or spectral graph theory), which is mostly developed for undirected graphs. However, this formalism neglects the fact that the underlying (wireless) networks in practice contain asymmetric links, which are best characterized by directed graphs (digraphs). Therefore, random walk on digraphs is a more appropriate model to consider for such networks. In this paper, by generalizing the random walk theory (or spectral graph theory) that has been primarily developed for undirected graphs to digraphs, we show how various transmission costs in wireless networks can be formulated in terms of hitting times and cover times of random walks on digraphs. Using these results, we develop a unified theoretical framework for estimating various transmission costs in wireless networks. Our framework can be applied to random walk query processing strategy and the three routing paradigms--best path routing, opportunistic routing, and stateless routing--to which nearly all existing routing protocols belong. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed digraph-based analytical model can achieve more accurate transmission cost estimation over existing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10413","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10413","fieldValue":"Random walks and Green's function on digraphs: a framework for estimating wireless transmission costs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10413","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10413","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10414","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a general, flexible, hardware-aware network platform that takes hardware processing behavior into consideration to accurately evaluate network performance. The platform adopts a network-hardware co-simulation approach in which the NS-2 network simulator supervises the network-wide traffic flow and the SystemC hardware simulator simulates the underlying hard-ware processing in network nodes. In addition, as a case study, we implemented wireless all-to-all broadcasting with network coding on the platform. We analyze the hardware processing behavior during the algorithm execution and evaluate the overall performance of the algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that hardware processing can have a significant impact on the algorithm performance and hence should be taken into consideration in the algorithm design. We expect that this hardware-aware platform will become a very useful tool for more accurate network simulations and more efficient design space exploration of processing-intensive applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10414","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10414","fieldValue":"A flexible platform for hardware-aware network experiments and a case study on wireless network coding"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10414","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10414","fieldValue":"ACM"}
