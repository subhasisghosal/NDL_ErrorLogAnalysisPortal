Common approaches for analyzing these systems include Markov processes, renewal theory, and random walks. This article presents optimization models for sample paths of closed tandem queues. These mathematical models provide a new tool for analyzing these queueing systems using the techniques and algorithms from mathematical programming, and from graph theory in particular. We then apply operators from computer graphics (electronic picture manipulation) to graph theoretic representations of discrete-event system dynamics to establish some fundamental mathematical properties for these queueing systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24971","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24971","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3416","fieldValue":" In this article, an image integration technique called Virtual Mirroring (VM) is evaluated. VM is a technique that combines multiple 2D views of a 3D scene into a single composite image by overlaying views onto virtual mirrors. Given multiple views of a scene, one view is augmented with the remaining views by placing virtual mirrors on the first view and overlaying onto them the corresponding remaining views. Unlike a standard array presentation, where 2D views are not integrated and simply placed adjacent to one another, the VM presentation preserves the relative location, orientation, and scale between views. As such, it is our contention that humans will fare better at performing certain visual tasks, such as scene identification, when viewing a 3D scene via a VM presentation than when viewing an array presentation. We performed an experiment on 12 participants, where participants were required to identify 96 scenes both with a VM and an array presentation and we compared their &percnt; correctness and response times. Moreover, we studied the effects of adding an auditory attentional load on performance. We found that regardless of load, participants were able to identify scenes using VM presentation with greater accuracy and at greater speeds."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24972","fieldValue":" In this article, we investigate the differences between simulation and emulation when conducting denial of service (DoS) attack experiments. As a case study, we consider low-rate TCP-targeted DoS attacks. We design constructs and tools for emulation testbeds to achieve a level of control comparable to simulation tools. Through a careful sensitivity analysis, we expose difficulties in obtaining meaningful measurements from the DETER, Emulab, and WAIL testbeds with default system settings. We find dramatic differences between simulation and emulation results for DoS experiments. Our results also reveal that software routers such as Click provide a flexible experimental platform, but require understanding and manipulation of the underlying network device drivers. Our experiments with commercial Cisco routers demonstrate that they are highly susceptible to the TCP-targeted attacks when ingress\/egress IP filters are used."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24972","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24972","fieldValue":"ACM"}
