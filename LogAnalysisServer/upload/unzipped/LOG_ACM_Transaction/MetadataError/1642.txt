The operator weights contrast distortions according to their visibility predicted by the model of the human visual system. The distortions are minimized given a display model that enforces constraints on the solution. We show that the problem can be solved very efficiently by employing higher order image statistics and quadratic programming. Our tone mapping technique can adjust image or video content for optimum contrast visibility taking into account ambient illumination and display characteristics. We discuss the differences between our method and previous approaches to the tone mapping problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15940","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15940","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15941","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15941","fieldValue":" The diversity of display technologies and introduction of high dynamic range imagery introduces the necessity of comparing images of radically different dynamic ranges. Current quality assessment metrics are not suitable for this task, as they assume that both reference and test images have the same dynamic range. Image fidelity measures employed by a majority of current metrics, based on the difference of pixel intensity or contrast values between test and reference images, result in meaningless predictions if this assumption does not hold. We present a novel image quality metric capable of operating on an image pair where both images have arbitrary dynamic ranges. Our metric utilizes a model of the human visual system, and its central idea is a new definition of visible distortion based on the detection and classification of visible changes in the image structure. Our metric is carefully calibrated and its performance is validated through perceptual experiments. We demonstrate possible applications of our metric to the evaluation of direct and inverse tone mapping operators as well as the analysis of the image appearance on displays with various characteristics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15941","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15941","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15942","fieldValue":" White balance is a crucial step in the photographic pipeline. It ensures the proper rendition of images by eliminating color casts due to differing illuminants. Digital cameras and editing programs provide white balance tools that assume a single type of light per image, such as daylight. However, many photos are taken under mixed lighting. We propose a white balance technique for scenes with two light types that are specified by the user. This covers many typical situations involving indoor\/outdoor or flash\/ambient light mixtures. Since we work from a single image, the problem is highly underconstrained. Our method recovers a set of dominant material colors which allows us to estimate the local intensity mixture of the two light types. Using this mixture, we can neutralize the light colors and render visually pleasing images. Our method can also be used to achieve post-exposure relighting effects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15942","fieldValue":"ACM"}
