{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10824","fieldValue":" Homology theory provides new and powerful solutions to address the coverage problems in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). They are based on algebraic objects, such as Čech complex and Rips complex. Čech complex gives accurate information about coverage quality, but requires a precise knowledge of the relative locations of nodes. This assumption is rather strong and hard to implement in practical deployments. Rips complex provides an approximation of Čech complex. It is easier to build and does not require any knowledge of nodes location. This simplicity is at the expense of accuracy. Rips complex cannot always detect all coverage holes. It is then necessary to evaluate its accuracy. This work proposes to use the proportion of the area of undiscovered coverage holes as performance criteria. Investigations show that it depends on the ratio between communication and sensing radii of a sensor. Closed-form expressions for lower and upper bounds of the accuracy are also derived. For those coverage holes that can be discovered by Rips complex, a homology-based distributed algorithm is proposed to detect them. Simulation results are consistent with the proposed analytical lower bound, with a maximum difference of 0.5%. Upper-bound performance depends on the ratio of communication and sensing radii. Simulations also show that the algorithm can localize about 99% coverage holes in about 99% cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10824","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10824","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10824","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10825","fieldValue":"Ho, Pin-Han"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10825","fieldValue":" Shared protection, such as failure-dependent protection (FDP), is well recognized for its outstanding capacity efficiency in all-optical mesh networks, at the expense of lengthy restoration time due to multihop signaling mechanisms for failure localization, notification, and device configuration. This paper investigates a novel monitoring trail (m-trail) scenario, called Global Neighborhood Failure Localization (G-NFL), that aims to enable any shared protection scheme, including FDP, for achieving all-optical and ultra-fast failure restoration. We first define the neighborhood of a node, which is a set of links whose failure states should be known to the node in restoration of the corresponding working lightpaths (W-LPs). By assuming every node can obtain the on--off status of traversing m-trails and W-LPs via lambda monitoring, the proposed G-NFL problem routes a set of m-trails such that each node can localize any failure in its neighborhood. Bound analysis is performed on the minimum bandwidth required for m-trails under the proposed G-NFL problem. Then, a simple yet efficient heuristic approach is presented. Extensive simulation is conducted to verify the proposed G-NFL scenario under a number of different definitions of nodal neighborhood that concern the extent of dependency between the monitoring plane and data plane. The effect of reusing the spare capacity by FDP for supporting m-trails is examined. We conclude that the proposed G-NFL scenario enables a general shared protection scheme, toward signaling-free and ultra-fast failure restoration like p-Cycle, while achieving optimal capacity efficiency as FDP."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10825","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10825","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10825","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10826","fieldValue":" Edge networks connected to the Internet need effective monitoring techniques to inform routing decisions and detect violations of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). However, existing measurement tools, like ping, traceroute, and trajectory sampling, are vulnerable to attacks that can make a path look better than it really is. Here, we design and analyze a lightweight path-quality monitoring protocol that reliably raises an alarm when the packet-loss rate exceed a threshold, even when an adversary tries to bias monitoring results by selectively delaying, dropping, modifying, injecting, or preferentially treating packets. Our protocol is based on sublinear algorithms for sketching the second moment of stream of items and can monitor billions of packets using only 250--600 B of storage and the periodic transmission of a comparably sized IP packet. We also show how this protocol can be used to construct a more sophisticated protocol that allows the sender to localize the link responsible for the dropped packets. We prove that our protocols satisfy a precise definition of security, analyze their performance using numerical experiments, and derive analytic expressions for the tradeoff between statistical accuracy and system overhead. This paper contains a deeper treatment of results from earlier conference papers and several new results."}
