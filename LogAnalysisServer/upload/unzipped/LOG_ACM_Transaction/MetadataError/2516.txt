{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18509","fieldValue":" Methods are known for the exact computation of the solution of integer systems of linear equations AX = B with a nonsingular coefficient matrix A by congruence techniques. These methods are now generalized for systems with an arbitrary integer coefficient matrix A. To make congruence techniques applicable, a common denominator of all elements of the solution X = A+B must be computed. This is achieved by defining the natural denominator CODE of A+ and describing it by some formulas. Methods for the exact computation of additional results (consistency, null space, solution of at most R nonzero elements), a recursive test to save computing time, and a comparison with some results from the literature are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18510","fieldValue":" The program package ACRITH (High-Accuracy Arithmetic Subroutine Library) provides FORTRAN subroutines for the solution of several standard mathematical problems. The routines use floating point operations with extended precision and interval arithmetic and are designated especially for the solution of ill-conditioned problems. Test results for most of the routines are presented with emphasis on the practical usability of the package. It turns out that not all routines are of equal high quality and reliability; in the documentation, hints to the implemented numerical algorithms are completely missing, and the error messages are not always concise. Some possible alternatives like symbolic algebra systems or multiple precision packages are mentioned."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18512","fieldValue":"ACM"}
