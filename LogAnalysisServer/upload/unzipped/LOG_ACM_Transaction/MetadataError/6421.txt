When it comes to the issue of CPES security, the most significant problem is the security of Embedded Sensor Networks (ESNs). With the continuous growth of ESNs, the security of transferring data from sensors to their destinations has become an important research area. Due to the limitations in power, storage, and processing capabilities, existing security mechanisms for wired or wireless networks cannot apply directly to ESNs. Meanwhile, ESNs are likely to be attacked by different kinds of attacks in industrial scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to develop new techniques or modify the current security mechanisms to overcome these problems. In this article, we focus on Intrusion Detection (ID) techniques and propose a new attack-defense game model to detect malicious nodes using a repeated game approach. As a direct consequence of the game model, attackers and defenders make different strategies to achieve optimal payoffs. Importantly, error detection and missing detection are taken into consideration in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), where a game tree model is introduced to solve this problem. In addition, we analyze and prove the existence of pure Nash equilibrium and mixed Nash equilibrium. Simulations show that the proposed model can both reduce energy consumption by up to 50% compared with the existing All Monitor (AM) model and improve the detection rate by up to 10% to 15% compared with the existing Cluster Head (CH) monitor model."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/7065","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China (Wang, Kun; Du, Miao); Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China (Shen, Jian); Colorado School of Mines, Denver, USA (Yang, Dejun); Simula Research Laboratory &#x38; University of Oslo, Norway (Zhang, Yan); University of British Columbia, BC, Canada (Zhu, Chunsheng)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7066","fieldValue":"Song, Wen-Zhan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7066","fieldValue":" We present ScorePlus, a software-hardware hybrid and federated experiment environment for Smart Grid.

Ocular Artifacts (OA) usually contaminates EEG signals, removal of which is critical for accurate feature extraction and classification. With the increasing adoption of wearable technologies, single-channel real-time EEG systems that often require real-time signal processing for immediate real-time feedback are becoming more prevalent. However, traditional OA removal algorithms usually require multiple channels of EEG data, are computationally expensive, and do not perform well in real-time. In this article, a new hybrid algorithm is proposed that autonomously detects OA and subsequently removes OA from a single-channel steaming EEG data in real-time. The proposed single EEG channel algorithm also does not require additional reference electrooculography (EOG) channel. The algorithm has also been implemented on an embedded hardware platform of single channel wearable EEG system (NeuroMonitor). The algorithm first detects the OA zones using an Algebraic approach and then removes these artifacts from the detected OA zones using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition method. The de-noising technique is applied only to the OA zone, which minimizes loss of neural information outside the OA zone. A qualitative and quantitative performance evaluation was carried out with a 0.5s epoch in overlapping sliding window technique using time-frequency analysis, mean square coherence, and correlation coefficient statistics. The hybrid OA removal algorithm demonstrated real-time operation with 3s latency on the PSoC-3-microcontroller-based EEG system. Successful implementation of OA removal from single-channel real-time EEG data using the proposed algorithm shows promise for real-time feedback applications of wearable EEG devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7067","fieldValue":"Autonomous OA Removal in Real-Time from Single Channel EEG Data on a Wearable Device Using a Hybrid Algebraic-Wavelet Algorithm"}
