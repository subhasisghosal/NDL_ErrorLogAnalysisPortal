This can be done without tying the study to a specific simulation package or language. It is valuable to do so to avoid unnecessarily long development and execution times. In this article, we offer a simulation information model (SIM) designed to help organize system information in the early stages of a project. (It can also be used to analyze existing models.) The SIM allows complexity analysis of the system to be performed, and may lead to a better selection of simulation language. The SIM is illustrated using two examples, and its relationship to current formalisms is discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24996","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24996","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3418","fieldValue":" Reading is one of the most well-studied visual activities. Vision research traditionally focuses on understanding the perceptual and cognitive processes involved in reading. In this work we recognize reading activity by jointly analyzing eye and head movements of people in an everyday environment. Eye movements are recorded using an electrooculography (EOG) system; body movements using body-worn inertial measurement units. We compare two approaches for continuous recognition of reading: String matching (STR) that explicitly models the characteristic horizontal saccades during reading, and a support vector machine (SVM) that relies on 90 eye movement features extracted from the eye movement data. We evaluate both methods in a study performed with eight participants reading while sitting at a desk, standing, walking indoors and outdoors, and riding a tram. We introduce a method to segment reading activity by exploiting the sensorimotor coordination of eye and head movements during reading. Using person-independent training, we obtain an average precision for recognizing reading of 88.9&percnt; (recall 72.3&percnt;) using STR and of 87.7&percnt; (recall 87.9&percnt;) using SVM over all participants. We show that the proposed segmentation scheme improves the performance of recognizing reading events by more than 24&percnt;. Our work demonstrates that the joint analysis of eye and body movements is beneficial for reading recognition and opens up discussion on the wider applicability of a multimodal recognition approach to other visual and physical activities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3418","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3418","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24997","fieldValue":" To enhance efficiency in Monte Carlo simulations, we develop an adaptive stratified sampling algorithm for allocation of sampling effort within each stratum, in which an adaptive variance reduction technique is applied. Given the number of replications in each batch, our algorithm updates allocation fractions to minimize the work-normalized variance of the stratified estimator of the mean. We establish the asymptotic normality of the stratified estimator of the mean as the number of batches tends to infinity. Although implementation of the proposed algorithm requires a small amount of initial work, the algorithm has the potential to yield substantial improvements in estimator efficiency. Equally important is that the adaptive framework avoids the need for frequent recalibration of the parameters of the variance reduction methods applied within each stratum when changes occur in the experimental conditions governing system performance. To illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of our algorithm, we provide numerical results for a Black--Scholes option pricing, where we stratify the underlying Brownian motion with respect to its terminal value and apply an importance sampling method to normal random variables filling in the Brownian path. Relative to the estimator variance with proportional allocation, the proposed algorithm achieved a fourfold reduction in estimator variance with a negligible increase in computing time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24997","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24997","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24998","fieldValue":" Content distribution networks (CDNs) have gained considerable attention in the past few years. Hence there is need for developing frameworks for carrying out CDN simulations. In this article we present a modeling and simulation framework for CDNs, called CDNsim. CDNsim has been designated to provide a realistic simulation for CDNs, simulating the surrogate servers, the TCP\/IP protocol, and the main CDN functions. The main advantages of this tool are its high performance, its extensibility, and its user interface, which is used to configure its parameters. CDNsim provides an automated environment for conducting experiments and extracting client, server, and network statistics. The purpose of CDNsim is to be used as a testbed for CDN evaluation and experimentation. This is quite useful to both the research community (to experiment with new CDN data management techniques), and for CDN developers (to evaluate profits on prior certain CDN installations)."}
