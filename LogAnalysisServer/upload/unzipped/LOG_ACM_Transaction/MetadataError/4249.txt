Our approach is to allow users to compose Boolean queries in one rich front-end language. For each user query and target source, we transform the user query into a subsuming query that can be supported by the source but that may return extra documents. The results are then processed by a filter query to yield the correct final results. In this article we introduce the architecture and associated mechanism for query translation. In particular, we discuss techniques for rewriting predicates in Boolean queries into native subsuming forms, which is a basis of translating complex queries. In addition, we present experimental results for evaluating the cost of postfiltering. We also discuss the drawbacks of this approach and cases when it may not be effective. We have implemented prototype versions of these mechanisms and demonstrated them on heterogeneous Boolean systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23799","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23799","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23800","fieldValue":" The problem of using a broker to select a subset of available information servers in order to achieve a good trade-off between document retrieval effectiveness and cost is addressed. Server selection methods which are capable of operating in the absence of global information, and where servers have no knowledge of brokers, are investigated. A novel method using Lightweight Probe queries (LWP method) is compared with several methods based on data from past query processing, while Random and Optimal server rankings serve as controls. Methods are evaluated, using TREC data and relevance judgments, by computing ratios, both empirical and ideal, of recall and early precision for the subset versus the complete set of available servers. Estimates are also made of the best-possible performance of each of the methods. LWP and Topic Similarity methods achieved best results, each being capable of retrieving about 60% of the relevant documents for only one-third of the cost of querying all servers. Subject to the applicable cost model, the LWP method is likely to be preferred because it is suited to dynamic environments. The good results obtained with a simple automatic LWP implementation were replicated using different data and a larger set of query topics."}
