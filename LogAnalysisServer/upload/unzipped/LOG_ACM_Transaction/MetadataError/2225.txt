{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17410","fieldValue":" Delaunay meshes (DM) are a special type of triangle mesh where the local Delaunay condition holds everywhere. We present an efficient algorithm to convert an arbitrary manifold triangle mesh M into a Delaunay mesh. We show that the constructed DM has O(Kn) vertices, where n is the number of vertices in M and K is a model-dependent constant. We also develop a novel algorithm to simplify Delaunay meshes, allowing a smooth choice of detail levels. Our methods are conceptually simple, theoretically sound and easy to implement. The DM construction algorithm also scales well due to its O(nK log K) time complexity. Delaunay meshes have many favorable geometric and numerical properties. For example, a DM has exactly the same geometry as the input mesh, and it can be encoded by any mesh data structure. Moreover, the empty geodesic circumcircle property implies that the commonly used cotangent Laplace-Beltrami operator has non-negative weights. Therefore, the existing digital geometry processing algorithms can benefit the numerical stability of DM without changing any codes. We observe that DMs can improve the accuracy of the heat method for computing geodesic distances. Also, popular parameterization techniques, such as discrete harmonic mapping, produce more stable results on the DMs than on the input meshes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17411","fieldValue":" Acquiring 3D geometry of an object is a tedious and time-consuming task, typically requiring scanning the surface from multiple viewpoints. In this work we focus on reconstructing complete geometry from a single scan acquired with a low-quality consumer-level scanning device. Our method uses a collection of example 3D shapes to build structural part-based priors that are necessary to complete the shape. In our representation, we associate a local coordinate system to each part and learn the distribution of positions and orientations of all the other parts from the database, which implicitly also defines positions of symmetry planes and symmetry axes. At the inference stage, this knowledge enables us to analyze incomplete point clouds with substantial occlusions, because observing only a few regions is still sufficient to infer the global structure. Once the parts and the symmetries are estimated, both data sources, symmetry and database, are fused to complete the point cloud. We evaluate our technique on a synthetic dataset containing 481 shapes, and on real scans acquired with a Kinect scanner. Our method demonstrates high accuracy for the estimated part structure and detected symmetries, enabling higher quality shape completions in comparison to alternative techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17411","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17411","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17412","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17412","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present a consolidation method that is based on a new representation of 3D point sets. The key idea is to augment each surface point into a deep point by associating it with an inner point that resides on the meso-skeleton, which consists of a mixture of skeletal curves and sheets. The deep points representation is a result of a joint optimization applied to both ends of the deep points. The optimization objective is to fairly distribute the end points across the surface and the meso-skeleton, such that the deep point orientations agree with the surface normals. The optimization converges where the inner points form a coherent meso-skeleton, and the surface points are consolidated with the missing regions completed. The strength of this new representation stems from the fact that it is comprised of both local and non-local geometric information. We demonstrate the advantages of the deep points consolidation technique by employing it to consolidate and complete noisy point-sampled geometry with large missing parts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17412","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17412","fieldValue":"ACM"}
