An important problem is to provide network managers with information about changes in traffic, informing them about \"what's new.\" Specifically, we focus on the challenge of finding significantly large differences in traffic: over time, between interfaces and between routers. We introduce the idea of a deltoid: an item that has a large difference, whether the difference is absolute, relative or variational.We present novel algorithms for finding the most significant deltoids in high-speed traffic data, and prove that they use small space, very small time per update, and are guaranteed to find significant deltoids with pre-specified accuracy. In experimental evaluation with real network traffic, our algorithms perform well and recover almost all deltoids. This is the first work to provide solutions capable of working over the data with one pass, at network traffic speeds."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9401","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9401","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9401","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9402","fieldValue":" We consider pricing of network resources in a reservation-based quality-of-service architecture. The pricing policy implements a distributed resource allocation to provide guaranteed bounds on packet loss and end-to-end delay for real-time applications. Distributed pricing roles are assigned to each user, each network node, and an arbitrager in between the user and the network. When delay constraints are not binding, we investigate two dynamic pricing algorithms using gradient projection and Newton's method to update prices, and prove their convergence. We analyze the performance of the dynamic pricing policies and show that the gradient algorithm using Newton's method converges more quickly and displays only a few small fluctuations. When delay constraints are binding, we investigate subgradient methods which can provide convergence to some range of the optimal allocation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9402","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9402","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9402","fieldValue":"ACM"}
