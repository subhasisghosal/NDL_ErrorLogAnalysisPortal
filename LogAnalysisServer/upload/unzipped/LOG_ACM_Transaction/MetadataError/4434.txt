Since XML data is irregular and verbose, the disk space and the network bandwidth are wasted. To overcome the verbosity problem, research on compressors for XML data has been conducted. Some XML compressors do not support querying compressed data, while other XML compressors which support querying compressed data blindly encode tags and data values using predefined encoding methods. Existing XML compressors do not provide the facility for updates on compressed XML data.In this article, we propose XPRESS, an XML compressor which supports direct updates and efficient evaluations of queries on compressed XML data. XPRESS adopts a novel encoding method called reverse arithmetic encoding, which encodes label paths of XML data and applies diverse encoding methods depending on the types of data values. Experimental results with real-life data sets show that XPRESS achieves significant improvements on query performance for compressed XML data and reasonable compression ratios. On average, the query performance of XPRESS is 2.13 times better than that of an existing XML compressor, and the compression ratio of XPRESS is about 71&percnt;. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the updates performed directly on compressed XML data."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24335","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24335","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24335","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24336","fieldValue":" The Globe Distribution Network (GDN) is an application for the efficient, worldwide distribution of freely redistributable software packages. Distribution is made efficient by encapsulating the software into special distributed objects which efficiently replicate themselves near to the downloading clients. The Globe Distribution Network takes a novel, optimistic approach to stop the illegal distribution of copyrighted and illicit material via the network. Instead of having moderators check the packages at upload time, illegal content is removed and its uploader's access to the network permanently revoked only when the violation is discovered. Other protective measures defend the GDN against internal and external attacks to its availability. By exploiting the replication of the software and using fault-tolerant server software, the Globe Distribution Network achieves high availability. A prototype implementation of the GDN is available from http:\/\/www.cs.vu.nl\/globe\/."}
