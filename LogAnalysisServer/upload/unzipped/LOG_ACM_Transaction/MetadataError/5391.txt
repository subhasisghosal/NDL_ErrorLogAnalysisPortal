Our focus is on problems where the values taken by each variable do not all have the same importance and where the data may be contaminated with noise and contain outliers, as is the case with microarray data. The usual PCA is not appropriate to deal with this kind of problems. In this context, we propose the use of a new correlation coefficient as an alternative to Pearson's. This leads to a so-called weighted PCA (WPCA). In order to illustrate the features of our WPCA and compare it with the usual PCA, we consider the problem of analyzing gene expression data sets. In the second part of this work, we propose a new PCA-based algorithm to iteratively select the most important genes in a microarray data set. We show that this algorithm produces better results when our WPCA is used instead of the usual PCA. Furthermore, by using Support Vector Machines, we show that it can compete with the Significance Analysis of Microarrays algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4558","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4558","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4558","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4559","fieldValue":" Noise disturbances and time delays are frequently met in cellular genetic regulatory systems. This paper is concerned with the disturbance analysis of a class of genetic regulatory networks described by nonlinear differential equation models. The mechanisms of genetic regulatory networks to amplify (attenuate) external disturbance are explored, and a simple measure of the amplification (attenuation) level is developed from a nonlinear robust control point of view. It should be noted that the conditions used to measure the disturbance level are delay-independent or delay-dependent, and are expressed within the framework of linear matrix inequalities, which can be characterized as convex optimization, and computed by the interior-point algorithm easily. Finally, by the proposed method, a numerical example is provided to illustrate how to measure the attenuation of proteins in the presence of external disturbances."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4559","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4559","fieldValue":"Disturbance attenuation, asymptotic stability, genetic regulatory network, systems biology, time delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4559","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4559","fieldValue":"ACM"}
