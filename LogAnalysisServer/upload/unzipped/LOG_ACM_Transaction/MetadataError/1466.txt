{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15482","fieldValue":" 4-3 direction subdivision combines quad and triangle meshes. On quad submeshes it applies a 4-direction alternative to Catmull-Clark subdivision and on triangle submeshes a modification of Loop's scheme. Remarkably, 4-3 surfaces can be proven to be $C^1 and have bounded curvature everywhere. In regular mesh regions, they are C2$ and correspond to two closely-related box-splines of degree four. The box-spline in quad regions has a smaller stencil than Catmull-Clark and defines the unique scheme with a 3 Ã\u2014 3 stencil that can model constant features without ripples both aligned with the quad grid and diagonal to it. From a theoretical point of view, 4-3 subdivision near extraordinary points is remarkable in that the eigenstructure of the local subdivision matrix is easy to determine and a complete analysis is possible. Without tweaking the rules artificially to force a specific spectrum, the leading eigenvalues ordered by modulus of all local subdivision matrices are 1, 1\/2, 1\/2, 1\/4 where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 1\/4 depends on the valence of the extraordinary point and the number of quads surrounding it. This implies equal refinement of the mesh, regardless of the number of neighbors of a mesh node."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15482","fieldValue":"CAD"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15482","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15482","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15483","fieldValue":" We present a signal-processing framework for analyzing the reflected light field from a homogeneous convex curved surface under distant illumination. This analysis is of theoretical interest in both graphics and vision and is also of practical importance in many computer graphics problems---for instance, in determining lighting distributions and bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs), in rendering with environment maps, and in image-based rendering. It is well known that under our assumptions, the reflection operator behaves qualitatively like a convolution. In this paper, we formalize these notions, showing that the reflected light field can be thought of in a precise quantitative way as obtained by convolving the lighting and BRDF, i.e. by filtering the incident illumination using the BRDF. Mathematically, we are able to express the frequency-space coefficients of the reflected light field as a product of the spherical harmonic coefficients of the illumination and the BRDF. These results are of practical importance in determining the well-posedness and conditioning of problems in inverse rendering---estimation of BRDF and lighting parameters from real photographs. Furthermore, we are able to derive analytic formulae for the spherical harmonic coefficients of many common BRDF and lighting models. From this formal analysis, we are able to determine precise conditions under which estimation of BRDFs and lighting distributions are well posed and well-conditioned. Our mathematical analysis also has implications for forward rendering---especially the efficient rendering of objects under complex lighting conditions specified by environment maps. The results, especially the analytic formulae derived for Lambertian surfaces, are also relevant in computer vision in the areas of recognition, photometric stereo and structure from motion."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15483","fieldValue":"BRDF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15484","fieldValue":" We study the support of subdivision schemes: that is, the region of the subdivision surface that is affected by the displacement of a single control point. Our main results cover the regular case, where the mesh induces a regular Euclidean tesselation of the local parameter space. If n is the ratio of similarity between the tesselations at steps k and k âˆ\u2019 1 of the refinement, we show that n determines the extent of this region and largely determines whether its boundary is polygonal or fractal. In particular if n = 2 (or $n^2$ = 2 because we can always take double steps) the support is a convex polygon whose vertices can easily be determined. In other cases, whether the boundary of the support is fractal or not depends on whether there are sufficient points with non-zero coefficients in the edges of the convex hull of the mask. If there are enough points on every such edge, the support is again a convex polygon. If some edges have enough points and others do not, the boundary can consist of a fractal assembly of an unbounded number of line segments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15484","fieldValue":"ACM"}
