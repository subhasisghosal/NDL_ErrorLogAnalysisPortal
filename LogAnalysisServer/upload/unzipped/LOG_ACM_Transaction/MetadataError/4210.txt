The PIP (proximal interphalangeal) joint of the index finger was examined in Exps. 1--3 and the MCP (metacarpophalangeal) joint in Exps. 4--6. In Exp. 1, the just noticeable difference (JND) of PIP joint-angle position was measured when the MCP joint was either fully extended or halfway bent. In Exp. 2, the JND of PIP joint-angle position as a function of PIP joint-angle reference position was measured when the PIP joint was almost fully extended, halfway bent, or almost fully flexed. In Exp. 3, the information transfer of PIP joint-angle position was estimated with the MCP joint in a fully extended position. In Exps. 4--6, the JND and the information transfer of MCP joint-angle position were studied with a similar experimental design. The results show that the JNDs of the PIP joint-angle position were roughly constant (2.5Â°âˆ\u20192.7Â°) independent of the PIP joint-angle reference position or the MCP joint-angle position used (Exps. 1 and 2). The JNDs of the MCP joint-angle position, however, increased with the flexion of both the PIP and MCP joints and ranged from 1.7Â° to 2.7Â° (Exps. 4 and 5). The information transfer of the PIP and MCP joint-angle position were similar, indicating 3--4 perfectly identifiable joint-angle positions for both joints (Exps. 3 and 6). The results provide the basic data needed for estimating, for example, the resolution of fingertip position during active free motion. They are compared to the results from previous studies on joint position, length, and thickness perception."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3299","fieldValue":"JND"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3299","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23691","fieldValue":" In recent years, the computer science community has realized the advantages of GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces). Because high-quality GUIs are difficult to build, support tools such as UIMSs, UI Toolkits, and Interface Builders have been developed. Although these tools are powerful, they typically make two assumptions: first, that the programmer has some familiarity with the GUI model, and second, that he is willing to invest several weeks becoming proficient with the tool. These tools typically operate only on specific platforms, such as DOS, the Macintosh, or UNIX\/X-windows.The existing tools are beyond the reach of most undergraduate computer science majors, or professional programmers who wish to quickly build GUIs without investing the time to become specialists in GUI design. For this class of users, we developed SUIT, the Simple User Iinterface Toolkit. SUIT is an attempt to distill the fundamental components of an interface builder and GUI toolkit, and to explain those concepts with the tool itself, all in a short period of time. We have measured that college juniors with no previous GUI programming experience can use SUIT productively after less than three hours. SUIT is a C subroutine library which provides an external control UIMS, an interactive layout editor, and a set of standard â\u20ACœwidgets,â\u20AC? such as sliders, buttons, and check boxes. SUIT-based applications run transparently across the Macintosh, DOS, and UNIX\/X platforms. SUIT has been exported to hundreds of external sites on the internet. This paper describes SUIT's architecture, the design decisions we made during its development, and the lessons we learned from extensive observations of over 120 users."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23691","fieldValue":"GUI"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23691","fieldValue":"UIMS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23691","fieldValue":"ACM"}
