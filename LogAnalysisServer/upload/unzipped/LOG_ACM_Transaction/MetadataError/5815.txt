In this paper, a simplified three-node enzyme network is modeled by the Michaelis-Menten rate equations for all possible topologies, and a family of topologies and the corresponding parameter sets of the network with satisfactory adaptation are obtained using the multi-objective genetic algorithm. The proposed approach improves the computation efficiency significantly as compared to the time consuming exhaustive searching method. This approach provides a systemic way for searching the feasible topologies and the corresponding parameter sets to make the gene regulatory networks have robust adaptation. The proposed methodology, owing to its universality and simplicity, can be used to address more complex issues in biological networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5333","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5333","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5333","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5333","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5334","fieldValue":" Whole genome prediction of complex phenotypic traits using high-density genotyping arrays has attracted a lot of attention, as it is relevant to the fields of plant and animal breeding and genetic epidemiology. Since the number of genotypes is generally much bigger than the number of samples, predictive models suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The curse of dimensionality problem not only affects the computational efficiency of a particular genomic selection method, but can also lead to a poor performance, mainly due to possible overfitting, or un-informative features. In this work, we propose a novel transductive feature selection method, called MINT, which is based on the MRMR (Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy) criterion. We apply MINT on genetic trait prediction problems and show that, in general, MINT is a better feature selection method than the state-of-the-art inductive method MRMR."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5334","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
