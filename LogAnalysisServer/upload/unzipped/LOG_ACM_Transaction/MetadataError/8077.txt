{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2001","fieldValue":" Fault-Tolerant Voltage-Scalable (FTVS) SRAM cache architectures are a promising approach to improve energy efficiency of memories in the presence of nanoscale process variation. Complex FTVS schemes are commonly proposed to achieve very low minimum supply voltages, but these can suffer from high overheads and thus do not always offer the best power\/capacity trade-offs. We observe on our 45nm test chips that the â\u20ACœfault inclusion propertyâ\u20AC? can enable lightweight fault maps that support multiple runtime supply voltages. Based on this observation, we propose a simple and low-overhead FTVS cache architecture for power\/capacity scaling. Our mechanism combines multilevel voltage scaling with optional architectural support for power gating of blocks as they become faulty at low voltages. A static (SPCS) policy sets the runtime cache VDD once such that a only a few cache blocks may be faulty in order to minimize the impact on performance. We describe a Static Power\/Capacity Scaling (SPCS) policy and two alternate Dynamic Power\/Capacity Scaling (DPCS) policies that opportunistically reduce the cache voltage even further for more energy savings. This architecture achieves lower static power for all effective cache capacities than a recent more complex FTVS scheme. This is due to significantly lower overheads, despite the inability of our approach to match the min-VDD of the competing work at a fixed target yield. Over a set of SPEC CPâ\u20AC\u2020 benchmarks on two system configurations, the average total cache (system) energy saved by SPCS is 62&percnt; (22&percnt;), while the two DPCS policies achieve roughly similar energy reduction, around 79&percnt; (26&percnt;). On average, the DPCS approaches incur 2.24&percnt; performance and 6&percnt; area penalties."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10960","fieldValue":" Recently, in online social networks (OSNs), the least cost influence (LCI) problem has become one of the central research topics. It aims at identifying a minimum number of seed users who can trigger a wide cascade of information propagation. Most of existing literature investigated the LCI problem only based on an individual network. However, nowadays users often join several OSNs such that information could be spread across different networks simultaneously. Therefore, in order to obtain the best set of seed users, it is crucial to consider the role of overlapping users under this circumstances. In this article, we propose a unified framework to represent and analyze the influence diffusion in multiplex networks. More specifically, we tackle the LCI problem by mapping a set of networks into a single one via lossless and lossy coupling schemes. The lossless coupling scheme preserves all properties of original networks to achieve high-quality solutions, while the lossy coupling scheme offers an attractive alternative when the running time and memory consumption are of primary concern. Various experiments conducted on both real and synthesized datasets have validated the effectiveness of the coupling schemes, which also provide some interesting insights into the process of influence propagation in multiplex networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10960","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10960","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10960","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10960","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10961","fieldValue":" Heterogeneous wireless networks provide varying degrees of network coverage in a multi-tier configuration in which low-powered small cells are used to enhance performance. Due to the ad-hoc deployment of small cells, optimal resource allocation is important to provision fairness and enhance energy efficiency. We first study the worst outage probability problem in Rayleigh-fading channels, and solve this nonconvex stochastic program using mathematical tools from nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. As a by-product, we solve an open problem of convergence for a previously proposed algorithm in the interference-limited case. We then address a total power minimization problem with outage specification constraints and its feasibility issue. We propose a dynamic algorithm that adapts the outage probability specification in a heterogeneous wireless network to minimize the total energy consumption and to simultaneously provide fairness guarantees in terms of the worst outage probability. Finally, we provide numerical evaluation on the performance of the algorithms and the effectiveness of deploying closed-access small cells in heterogeneous wireless networks to address the tradeoff between energy saving and feasibility of users satisfying their outage probability specifications."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10961","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
