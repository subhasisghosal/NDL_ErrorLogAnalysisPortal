In this article, we propose a novel approach for solving the correspondence problem in a flexible manner. We show that from the 3D Delaunay triangulation, it is possible to derive a distance measure among regions lying in adjacent slices. Such distance is used to define a positive integer parameter, called Î², responsible for establishing the connections. Varying Î² thus allows the construction of different models from a given set of cross-sectional regions: small values of Î² causes closer regions to be connected into a single component, and as Î² increases, more distant regions are connected together. The algorithm, named Î²-connection, is described, and examples are provided that illustrate its applicability in solid modeling and model reconstruction from real data. The underlying reconstruction method is effective, which jointly with the Î²-connection correspondence strategy, improve the usability of volumetric reconstruction techniques considerably."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2480","fieldValue":" We consider the task of network exploration by a mobile agent (robot) with small memory. The agent has to traverse all nodes and edges of a network (represented as an undirected connected graph), and return to the starting node. Nodes of the network are unlabeled and edge ports are locally labeled at each node. The agent has no a priori knowledge of the topology of the network or of its size, and cannot mark nodes in any way. Under such weak assumptions, cycles in the network may prevent feasibility of exploration, hence we restrict attention to trees. We present an algorithm to accomplish tree exploration (with return) using O(log n)-bit memory for all n-node trees. This strengthens the result from Diks et al. [2004], where O(log$ ^2$ n)-bit memory was used for tree exploration, and matches the lower bound on memory size proved there. We also extend our O(log n)-bit memory traversal mechanism to a weaker model in which ports at each node are ordered in circular manner, however, the explicit values of port numbers are not available."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2480","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2480","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15620","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15620","fieldValue":" This article presents an algebraic analysis of a mesh-compression technique called high-pass quantization [Sorkine et al. 2003]. In high-pass quantization, a rectangular matrix based on the mesh topological Laplacian is applied to the vectors of the Cartesian coordinates of a polygonal mesh. The resulting vectors, called Î\u201D-coordinates, are then quantized. The applied matrix is a function of the topology of the mesh and the indices of a small set of mesh vertices (anchors) but not of the location of the vertices. An approximation of the geometry can be reconstructed from the quantized Î\u201D-coordinates and the spatial locations of the anchors. In this article, we show how to algebraically bound the reconstruction error that this method generates. We show that the small singular value of the transformation matrix can be used to bound both the quantization error and the rounding error which is due to the use of floating-point arithmetic. Furthermore, we prove a bound on this singular value. The bound is a function of the topology of the mesh and of the selected anchors. We also propose a new anchor-selection algorithm, inspired by this bound. We show experimentally that the method is effective and that the computed upper bound on the error is not too pessimistic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15620","fieldValue":"ACM"}
