First, these data streams are typically infinite-length, making traditional multipass learning algorithms inapplicable. Second, they exhibit significant concept-drift as attackers react and adapt to defenses. Third, for data streams that do not have any fixed feature set, such as text streams, an additional feature extraction and selection task must be performed. If the number of candidate features is too large, then traditional feature extraction techniques fail. In order to address the first two challenges, this article proposes a multipartition, multichunk ensemble classifier in which a collection of v classifiers is trained from r consecutive data chunks using v-fold partitioning of the data, yielding an ensemble of such classifiers. This multipartition, multichunk ensemble technique significantly reduces classification error compared to existing single-partition, single-chunk ensemble approaches, wherein a single data chunk is used to train each classifier. To address the third challenge, a feature extraction and selection technique is proposed for data streams that do not have any fixed feature set. The technique's scalability is demonstrated through an implementation for the Hadoop MapReduce cloud computing architecture. Both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrate its effectiveness over other state-of-the-art stream classification techniques on synthetic data, real botnet traffic, and malicious executables."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8151","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8151","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8151","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8152","fieldValue":"Schmidt-Rauch, Susanne"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8152","fieldValue":" This article describes a multiloop design approach, demonstrating two concatenated build-and-evaluate loops of a project that aims at enhancing and improving tele-counseling at travel agency call-centers. The socio-technical system design intends to implement and support a collaborative travel counseling concept which equalizes travel agents and customers within a value co-created service encounter to resolve the specific problems in travel agency call-centers. The design is finally guided by four instrumental goals: (1) increase transparency, (2) improve information quality, (3) support joint problem solving, and (4) create advisory experience. While the first build-and-evaluate loop mainly enhanced the workplace picture, the second build-and-evaluate loop primarily revealed organizational demands. This indicates that the proposed design approach enables sequentially broadening the problem space for design and supports iteratively moving forward the utility of the emerging artifact. Design is informed by concatenating insights from the previous loops which enrich understanding of the instrumental goals. The presented goals as well as the design approach are encouraging candidates for additional testing as a base for general design principles."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8152","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
