{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7454","fieldValue":" The concept of random walk (RW) has been widely applied in the design of recommendation systems. RW-based approaches are effective in handling locality problem and taking extra information, such as the relationships between items or users, into consideration. However, the traditional RW-based approach has a serious limitation in handling bidirectional opinions. The propagation of positive and negative information simultaneously in a graph is nontrivial using random walk. To address the problem, this article presents a novel and efficient RW-based model that can handle both positive and negative comments with the guarantee of convergence. Furthermore, we argue that a good recommendation system should provide users not only a list of recommended items but also reasonable explanations for the decisions. Therefore, we propose a technique that generates explanations by backtracking the influential paths and subgraphs. The results of experiments on the MovieLens and Netflix datasets show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RW-based algorithms, and is capable of improving the overall performance in the ensemble with other models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7454","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7455","fieldValue":"De Luca, Ernesto W."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7455","fieldValue":" The challenge and workshop on Context-Aware Movie Recommendation (CAMRa2010) were conducted jointly in 2010 with the Recommender Systems conference. The challenge focused on three context-aware recommendation scenarios: time-based, mood-based, and social recommendation. The participants were provided with anonymized datasets from two real-world online movie recommendation communities and competed against each other for obtaining the highest accuracy of recommendations. The datasets contained contextual features, such as tags, annotation, social relationsips, and comments, normally not available in public recommendation datasets. More than 40 teams from 21 countries participated in the challenge. Their participation was summarized by 10 papers published by the workshop, which have been extended and revised for this special section. In this preface we overview the challenge datasets, tasks, evaluation metrics, and the obtained outcomes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7455","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7455","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7456","fieldValue":" In the Social Web, a number of diverse recommendation approaches have been proposed to exploit the user generated contents available in the Web, such as rating, tagging, and social networking information. In general, these approaches naturally require the availability of a wide amount of these user preferences. This may represent an important limitation for real applications, and may be somewhat unnoticed in studies focusing on overall precision, in which a failure to produce recommendations gets blurred when averaging the obtained results or, even worse, is just not accounted for, as users with no recommendations are typically excluded from the performance calculations. In this article, we propose a coverage metric that uncovers and compensates for the incompleteness of performance evaluations based only on precision. We use this metric together with precision metrics in an empirical comparison of several social, collaborative filtering, and hybrid recommenders. The obtained results show that a better balance between precision and coverage can be achieved by combining social-based filtering (high accuracy, low coverage) and collaborative filtering (low accuracy, high coverage) recommendation techniques. We thus explore several hybrid recommendation approaches to balance this trade-off. In particular, we compare, on the one hand, techniques integrating collaborative and social information into a single model, and on the other, linear combinations of recommenders. For the last approach, we also propose a novel strategy to dynamically adjust the weight of each recommender on a user-basis, utilizing graph measures as indicators of the target user's connectedness and relevance in a social network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7456","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7456","fieldValue":"ACM"}
