To make caches cooperate on a large scale and effectively increase the cache population, several caches are usually federated in caching architectures. In this paper, we discuss and compare the performance of different caching architectures. In particular, we consider hierarchical and distributed caching. We derive analytical models to study important performance parameters of hierarchical and distributed caching, i.e., client's perceived latency, bandwidth usage, load in the caches, and disk space usage. Additionally, we consider a hybrid caching architecture that combines hierarchical caching with distributed caching at every level of a caching hierarchy. We evaluate the performance of a hybrid scheme and determine the optimal number of caches that should cooperate at each caching level to minimize client's retrieval latency."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9061","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9062","fieldValue":"Ho, Yung-Lung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9062","fieldValue":" In this paper, a new adaptive forward-error-correction scheme (AFEC) is introduced at the link layer for TCP\/IP data traffic in wireless ATM networks. The fading and interference in wireless links cause high and variable error rates, as well as bursty errors. The purpose of the AFEC scheme is to provide a dynamic error-control mechanism by using the Reed-Solomon coding to protect the ATM cell payload, as well as the payload type indicator\/cell loss priority fields in the ATM cell header. In order to enhance the error tolerance in cell framing and correct delivery, the AFEC scheme functions within a new concept called LANET framing and addressing protection mechanisms. The AFEC scheme has been validated using a simulation testbed of a low-speed wireless ATM network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9062","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
