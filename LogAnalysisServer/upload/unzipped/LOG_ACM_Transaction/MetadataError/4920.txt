Motivated by the advances in cloud computing, there is a growing need to outsource such computational intensive image feature detection tasks to cloud for its economic computing resources and on-demand ubiquitous access. However, the concerns over the effective protection of private image and multimedia data when outsourcing it to cloud platform become the major barrier that impedes the further implementation of cloud computing techniques over massive amount of image and multimedia data. To address this fundamental challenge, we study the state-of-the-art image feature detection algorithms and focus on Scalar Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), which is one of the most important local feature detection algorithms and has been broadly employed in different areas, including object recognition, image matching, robotic mapping, and so on. We analyze and model the privacy requirements in outsourcing SIFT computation and propose Secure Scalar Invariant Feature Transform (SecSIFT), a high-performance privacy-preserving SIFT feature detection system. In contrast to previous works, the proposed design is not restricted by the efficiency limitations of current homomorphic encryption scheme. In our design, we decompose and distribute the computation procedures of the original SIFT algorithm to a set of independent, co-operative cloud servers and keep the outsourced computation procedures as simple as possible to avoid utilizing a computationally expensive homomorphic encryption scheme. The proposed SecSIFT enables implementation with practical computation and communication complexity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SecSIFT performs comparably to original SIFT on image benchmarks while capable of preserving the privacy in an efficient way."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25764","fieldValue":"SIFT"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25765","fieldValue":" Clustering is a commonly used technique for multimedia data analysis and management. In this article, we propose a high-order clustering algorithm by fast search and find of density peaks (HOCFS) by extending the traditional clustering scheme by fast search and find of density peaks (CFS) algorithm from the vector space to the tensor space for multimedia data clustering. Furthermore, we propose a privacy preserving HOCFS algorithm (PPHOCFS) which improves the efficiency of the HOCFS algorithm by using the cloud computing to perform most of the clustering operations. To protect the private data in the multimedia data sets during the clustering process on the cloud, the raw data is encrypted by the Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikun-tanathan (BGV) strategy before being uploaded to the cloud for performing the HOCFS clustering algorithm efficiently. In the proposed method, the client is required to only execute the encryption\/decryption operations and the cloud servers are employed to perform all the computing operations. Finally, the performance of our scheme is evaluated on two representative multimedia data sets, namely NUS-WIDE and SNAE2, in terms of clustering accuracy, execution time, and speedup in the experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed PPHOCFS scheme can save at least 40% running time compared with HOCFS, without disclosing the private data on the cloud, making our scheme securely suitable for multimedia big data clustering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25765","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25765","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25766","fieldValue":" The dramatically growing demand of Cyber Physical and Social Computing (CPSC) has enabled a variety of novel channels to reach services in the financial industry. Combining cloud systems with multimedia big data is a novel approach for Financial Service Institutions (FSIs) to diversify service offerings in an efficient manner. However, the security issue is still a great issue in which the service availability often conflicts with the security constraints when the service media channels are varied. This paper focuses on this problem and proposes a novel approach using the Semantic-Based Access Control (SBAC) techniques for acquiring secure financial services on multimedia big data in cloud computing. The proposed approach is entitled IntercroSsed Secure Big Multimedia Model (2SBM), which is designed to secure accesses between various media through the multiple cloud platforms. The main algorithms supporting the proposed model include the Ontology-Based Access Recognition (OBAR) Algorithm and the Semantic Information Matching (SIM) Algorithm.
