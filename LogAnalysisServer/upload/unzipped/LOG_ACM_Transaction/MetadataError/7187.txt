Our objective in this paper is to assess to what extent today's Internet meets this expectation. Our assessment is based on delay and loss measurements taken over wide-area backbone networks and uses subjective voice quality measures capturing the various impairments incurred. First, we compile the results of various studies into a single model for assessing the voice-over-IP (VoIP) quality. Then, we identify different types of typical Internet paths and study their VoIP performance. For each type of path, we identify those characteristics that affect the VoIP perceived quality. Such characteristics include the network loss and the delay variability that should be appropriately handled by the playout scheduling at the receiver. Our findings indicate that although voice services can be adequately provided by some ISPs, a significant number of Internet backbone paths lead to poor performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9195","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9196","fieldValue":" In MPLS\/GMPLS networks, a range of restoration schemes will be required to support different tradeoffs between service interruption time and network resource utilization. In light of these tradeoffs, path-based end-to-end shared mesh restoration provides a very attractive solution. However, efficient use of bandwidth for shared mesh restoration strongly relies on the procedure for selecting restoration paths. In this paper, we propose an efficient restoration path selection algorithm for restorable connections over shared bandwidth in a fully distributed MPLS\/GMPLS architecture. We also describe how to extend MPLS\/GMPLS signaling protocols to collect the necessary information efficiently. To evaluate the algorithm's performance, we compare it via simulation with two other well-known algorithms on a typical intercity backbone network. The key figure of merit for restoration bandwidth efficiency is restoration overbuild, i.e., the extra bandwidth required to meet the network restoration objective as a percentage of the bandwidth of the network with no restoration. Our simulation results show that our algorithm uses significantly less restoration overbuild (63%-68%) compared with the other two algorithms (83%-90%)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9196","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9196","fieldValue":"GMPLS"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9196","fieldValue":"MPLS"}
