This approach leads to a better understanding of the relation between stepsize and error. A new dynamical model describing this relation is derived. The model is used as a basis for a new stepsize selection rule. This rule achieves better error control at little extra expense. The properties of the new model and the improved performance of the new error control are demonstrated using both analysis and numerical examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18809","fieldValue":" This paper describes a software package for finding the unconstrained minimizer of a nonlinear function of n variables. The package is intended for problems where n is not too largeâ\u20AC\u201Dsay, n 100â\u20AC\u201Dso that the cost of storing one n Ã\u2014 n matrix, and factoring it at each iteration, is acceptable. The software allows the user to choose between a recently developed â\u20ACœtensor methodâ\u20AC? for unconstrained optimization and an analogous standard method based on a quadratic model. The tensor method bases each iteration on a specially constructed fourth-order model of the objective function not significantly more expensive to form, store, or solve than the standard quadratic model. In our experience, the tensor method requires significantly fewer iterations and function evaluations to solve most unconstrained optimization problems than standard methods based on quadratic models, and also solves a somewhat wider range of problems. For these reasons, it may be a useful addition to numerical software libraries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2821","fieldValue":"Lai, Yu-Sheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2821","fieldValue":"Wu, Chung-Hsien"}
