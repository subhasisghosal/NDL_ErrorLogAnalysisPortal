Modern runtime systems offer a programming interface that complies with this paradigm and powerful engines for scheduling the tasks into which the application is decomposed. These tools have already proved their effectiveness on a number of dense linear algebra applications. This article evaluates the usability and effectiveness of runtime systems based on the Sequential Task Flow model for complex applications, namely, sparse matrix multifrontal factorizations that feature extremely irregular workloads, with tasks of different granularities and characteristics and with a variable memory consumption. Most importantly, it shows how this parallel programming model eases the development of complex features that benefit the performance of sparse, direct solvers as well as their memory consumption. We illustrate our discussion with the multifrontal QR factorization running on top of the StarPU runtime system."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19469","fieldValue":"Implementing Multifrontal Sparse Solvers for Multicore Architectures with Sequential Task Flow Runtime Systems"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2883","fieldValue":" In recent years, answer-focused summarization has gained attention as a technology complementary to information retrieval and question answering. In order to realize multi-document summarization focused by multiple questions, we propose a method to calculate sentence importance using scores, for responses to multiple questions, generated by a Question-Answering engine. Further, we describe the integration of this method with a generic multi-document summarization system. The evaluation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is better than not only several baselines but also other participants' systems at the evaluation workshop NTCIR4 TSC3 Formal Run. However, it should be noted that some of the other systems do not use the information of questions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2883","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2883","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19470","fieldValue":"Kim, Deok-Soo"}
