However, high-level estimations should be applicable at software level, possibly constructing effective power models depending on parameters that can be extracted directly from the application characteristics. We propose a methodology for accurate analysis of power consumption of message-passing primitives in a MPSoC, and, in particular, an energy model which, in spite of its simplicity, allows to model the traffic-dependent nature of energy consumption through the use of a single, abstract parameter, namely, the size of the message exchanged."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6331","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6331","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6332","fieldValue":" Power management is an important concern in sensor networks, because a tethered energy infrastructure is usually not available and an obvious concern is to use the available battery energy efficiently. However, in some of the sensor networking applications, an additional facility is available to ameliorate the energy problem: harvesting energy from the environment. Certain considerations in using an energy harvesting source are fundamentally different from that in using a battery, because, rather than a limit on the maximum energy, it has a limit on the maximum rate at which the energy can be used. Further, the harvested energy availability typically varies with time in a nondeterministic manner. While a deterministic metric, such as residual battery, suffices to characterize the energy availability in the case of batteries, a more sophisticated characterization may be required for a harvesting source. Another issue that becomes important in networked systems with multiple harvesting nodes is that different nodes may have different harvesting opportunity. In a distributed application, the same end-user performance may be achieved using different workload allocations, and resultant energy consumptions at multiple nodes. In this case, it is important to align the workload allocation with the energy availability at the harvesting nodes. We consider the above issues in power management for energy-harvesting sensor networks. We develop abstractions to characterize the complex time varying nature of such sources with analytically tractable models and use them to address key design issues. We also develop distributed methods to efficiently use harvested energy and test these both in simulation and experimentally on an energy-harvesting sensor network, prototyped for this work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6333","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose the novel concept of probabilistic design for multimedia embedded systems, which is motivated by the challenge of how to design, but not overdesign, such systems while systematically incorporating performance requirements of multimedia application, uncertainties in execution time, and tolerance for reasonable execution failures. Unlike most present techniques that are based on either worst- or average-case execution times of application tasks, where the former guarantees the completion of each execution, but often leads to overdesigned systems, and the latter fails to provide any completion guarantees, the proposed probabilistic design method takes advantage of unique features mentioned above of multimedia systems to relax the rigid hardware requirements for software implementation and avoid overdesigning the system. In essence, this relaxation expands the design space and we further develop an off-line on-line minimum effort algorithm for quick exploration of the enlarged design space at early design stages. This is the first step toward our goal of bridging the gap between real-time analysis and embedded software implementation for rapid and economic multimedia system design. It is our belief that the proposed method has great potential in reducing system resource while meeting performance requirements. The experimental results confirm this as we achieve significant saving in system's energy consumption to provide a statistical completion ratio guarantee (i.e., the expected number of completions over a large number of iterations is greater than a given value)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6333","fieldValue":"ACM"}
