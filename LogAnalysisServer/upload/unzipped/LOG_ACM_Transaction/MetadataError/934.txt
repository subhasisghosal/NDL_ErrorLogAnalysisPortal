The class of constraints includes functional dependencies, equality of domains, and constancy of domains. The relational algebra consists of projection, selection, restriction, cross product, union, and difference. The problem as given is undecidable, but if set difference is removed from the algebra, there is a solution. Operators specifying a closure function (similar to functional dependency closure on one relation) are defined; these will generate exactly the set of constraints valid on the given relational algebra expression. We prove that the operators are sound and complete."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13878","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13878","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13879","fieldValue":" A new inference control, called random sample queries, is proposed for safeguarding confidential data in on-line statistical databases. The random sample queries control deals directly with the basic principle of compromise by making it impossible for a questioner to control precisely the formation of query sets. Queries for relative frequencies and averages are computed using random samples drawn from the query sets. The sampling strategy permits the release of accurate and timely statistics and can be implemented at very low cost. Analysis shows the relative error in the statistics decreases as the query set size increases; in contrast, the effort required to compromise increases with the query set size due to large absolute errors. Experiments performed on a simulated database support the analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13879","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13879","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13880","fieldValue":" The problem of user inference in statistical databases is discussed and illustrated with several examples. It is assumed that the database allows â\u20ACœtotal,â\u20AC? â\u20ACœaverage,â\u20AC? â\u20ACœcount,â\u20AC? and â\u20ACœpercentileâ\u20AC? queries; a query may refer to any arbitrary subset of the database. Methods for protecting the security of such a database are considered; it is shown that any scheme which gives â\u20ACœstatistically correctâ\u20AC? answers is vulnerable to penetration. A precise definition of compromisability (in a statistical sense) is given. A general model of user inference is proposed; two special cases of this model appear to contain all previously published strategies for compromising a statistical database. A method for protecting the security of such a statistical database against these types of user inference is presented and discussed. It is shown that the number of queries required to compromise the database can be made arbitrarily large by accepting moderate increases in the variance of responses to queries. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the application of the techniques discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13880","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13880","fieldValue":"ACM"}
