Information obtained by the monitoring nodes needs to be routed to a set of designated gateway nodes. In these networks, every node is capable of sensing, data processing, and communication, and operates on its limited amount of battery energy consumed mostly in transmission and reception at its radio transceiver. If we assume that the transmitter power level can be adjusted to use the minimum energy required to reach the intended next hop receiver then the energy consumption rate per unit information transmission depends on the choice of the next hop node, i.e., the routing decision. We formulate the routing problem as a linear programming problem, where the objective is to maximize the network lifetime, which is equivalent to the time until the network partition due to battery outage. Two different models are considered for the information-generation processes. One assumes constant rates and the other assumes an arbitrary process. A shortest cost path routing algorithm is proposed which uses link costs that reflect both the communication energy consumption rates and the residual energy levels at the two end nodes. The algorithm is amenable to distributed implementation. Simulation results with both information-generation process models show that the proposed algorithm can achieve network lifetime that is very close to the optimal network lifetime obtained by solving the linear programming problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9235","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9235","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9235","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9236","fieldValue":" The User retrial phenomenon and its significant impact on network performance in unicast wireless systems are known and relatively well studied in the literature. However, there have been no previous studies on the impact of the user retrial phenomenon on other types of wireless networks. The objective of this paper is to extend the analysis of the user retrial phenomenon to wireless systems which, in addition to unicast service, also support a data broadcast service.This objective is realized by defining several performance measures appropriate for the analysis of hybrid unicast-broadcast systems in the presence of users' retrials. Subsequently, we derive the exact mathematical expression for each of the measures. Based on these expressions, we prove the existence of a single broadcast scheduling scheme, which ensures optimal system performance, with respect to the given set of proposed measures, the system's throughput, and the grade and quality of service. We also take a closer look at the class of hybrid unicast-broadcast systems with autonomous estimation of data item popularities, and we elaborate on the major challenges associated with such systems. Finally, we evaluate our theoretical expressions through simulation, and we discuss their robustness with respect to moderate deviations in the underlying model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9236","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
