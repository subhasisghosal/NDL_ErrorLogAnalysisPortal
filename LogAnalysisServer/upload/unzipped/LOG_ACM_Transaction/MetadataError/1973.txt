SURE is a general unbiased estimator for mean squared error (MSE) in statistics. With SURE, we are able to estimate error for an arbitrary reconstruction kernel, enabling us to use more effective kernels rather than being restricted to the symmetric ones used in previous work. It also allows us to allocate more samples to areas with higher estimated MSE. Adaptive sampling and reconstruction can therefore be processed within an optimization framework. We also propose an efficient and memory-friendly approach to reduce the impact of noisy geometry features where there is depth of field or motion blur. Experiments show that our method produces images with less noise and crisper details than previous methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16783","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16783","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2590","fieldValue":" We give an algorithm to morph between two planar orthogonal drawings of a graph, preserving planarity and orthogonality. The morph uses a quadratic number of steps, where each step is a linear morph (a linear interpolation between two drawings). This is the first algorithm to provide planarity-preserving morphs with well-behaved complexity for a significant class of graph drawings. Our method is to morph until each edge is represented by a sequence of segments, with corresponding segments parallel in the two drawings. Then, in a result of independent interest, we morph such parallel planar orthogonal drawings, preserving edge directions and planarity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2590","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2590","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16784","fieldValue":" We propose a novel approach for image space adaptive sampling and filtering in Monte Carlo rendering. We use an iterative scheme composed of three steps. First, we adaptively distribute samples in the image plane. Second, we denoise the image using a non-linear filter. Third, we estimate the residual per-pixel error of the filtered rendering, and the error estimate guides the sample distribution in the next iteration. The effectiveness of our approach hinges on the use of a state of the art image denoising technique, which we extend to an adaptive rendering framework. A key idea is to split the Monte Carlo samples into two buffers. This improves denoising performance and facilitates variance and error estimation. Our method relies only on the Monte Carlo samples, allowing us to handle arbitrary light transport and lens effects. In addition, it is robust to high noise levels and complex image content. We compare our approach to a state of the art adaptive rendering technique based on adaptive bandwidth selection and demonstrate substantial improvements in terms of both numerical error and visual quality. Our framework is easy to implement on top of standard Monte Carlo renderers and it incurs little computational overhead."}
