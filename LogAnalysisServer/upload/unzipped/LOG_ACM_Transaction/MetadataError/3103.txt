Each method is provided with an initial set of flow graph nodes that inherently affect a problem's solution. Other relevant nodes are those where potentially disparate solutions must combine. Previously, these so-called &fgr;-nodes were found by computing the iterated dominance frontiers of the initial set of nodes, a process that could take worst-case quadratic time with respect to the input flow graph. In this article we present an almost-linear algorithm for determining exactly the same set of &fgr;-nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20285","fieldValue":" We show how to specify components of concurrent systems. The specification of a system is the conjunction of its components' specifications. Properties of the system are proved by reasoning about its components. We consider both the decomposition of a given system into parts, and the composition of given parts to form a system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20285","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20285","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20286","fieldValue":" Solutions to resource allocation problems and other related synchronization problems in distributed systems are examined with respect to the measures of response time, message complexity, and failure locality. Response time measures the time it takes for an algorithm to respond to the requests of a process; message complexity measures the number of messages sent and received by a process; and failure locality characterizes the size of the network that is affected by the failure of a single process. An algorithm for the resource allocation problem that achieves a constant failure locality of four along with a quadratic response time and a quadratic message complexity is presented. Applications of the algorithm to other process synchronization problems in distributed systems are also demonstrated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20286","fieldValue":"ACM"}
