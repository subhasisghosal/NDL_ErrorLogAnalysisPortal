We extend and apply the Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) protocol to solving Minimum Disclosure Routing (MDR), namely, enabling an SP to route packets without disclosing routing information to InPs. We implement the proposed MDR protocol and evaluate its performance via experiments by comparing it against the prediction based on our analytical performance model. Our study reveals that MDR can be securely achieved with marginal latency overhead with regard to the convergence time in well-engineered nonsecure routing algorithms. Our study sheds light on the path for network virtualization to be used to resolve the challenges for the ISPs of today."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10537","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10538","fieldValue":" Many emerging scientific and industrial applications require transferring multiple terabytes of data on a daily basis. Examples include pushing scientific data from particle accelerators\/ colliders to laboratories around the world, synchronizing datacenters across continents, and replicating collections of high-definition videos from events taking place at different time-zones. A key property of all above applications is their ability to tolerate delivery delays ranging from a few hours to a few days. Such delay-tolerant bulk (DTB) data are currently being serviced mostly by the postal system using hard drives and DVDs, or by expensive dedicated networks. In this paper, we propose transmitting such data through commercial ISPs by taking advantage of already-paid-for off-peak bandwidth resulting from diurnal traffic patterns and percentile pricing. We show that between sender-receiver pairs with small time-zone difference, simple source scheduling policies are able to take advantage of most of the existing off-peak capacity. When the time-zone difference increases, taking advantage of the full capacity requires performing store-and-forward through intermediate storage nodes. We present an extensive evaluation of the two options based on traffic data from 200+ links of a large transit provider with points of presence (PoPs) at three continents. Our results indicate that there exists huge potential for performing multiterabyte transfers on a daily basis at little or no additional cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10538","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10539","fieldValue":"Ma, Richard T B"}
