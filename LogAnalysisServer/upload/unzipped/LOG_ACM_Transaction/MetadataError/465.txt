We show that a computable function is an almost randomness extractor if and only if it is a Kolmogorov complexity extractor, thus establishing a fundamental equivalence between two forms of extraction studied in the literature: Kolmogorov extraction and randomness extraction. We present a distribution Mk based on Kolmogorov complexity that is complete for randomness extraction in the sense that a computable function is an almost randomness extractor if and only if it extracts randomness from Mk."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12473","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12473","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12474","fieldValue":" We study (deterministic) isolation for certain structures in directed and undirected planar graphs. The motivation for undertaking such a study comes from recent positive results on this topic. For example: Bourke et al. [2009] isolate a directed path in planar graphs and subsequently Datta et al. [2010b] isolate a perfect matching in bipartite planar graphs. Our first observation is that sufficiently strong (and plausible) isolations for certain structures in planar graphs would have strong consequences such as: NL ‚ä\u2020 ‚ä\u2022L, Bipartite-Matching ‚àà NC, and NP ‚ä\u2020 ‚ä\u2022P. Our second observation is that although we do not yet have such strong isolations for arbitrary planar graphs, we do have them for bipartite planar graphs, that is, non-bipartiteness is the main bottleneck."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12474","fieldValue":"NC"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12474","fieldValue":"NC"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12474","fieldValue":"NL"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12474","fieldValue":"NL"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12474","fieldValue":"ACM"}
