Rating scores, a form of user-generated content contributed by reviewers in online rating systems, allow users to leverage othersâ\u20AC™ opinions in the evaluation of objects. In this article, we focus on the problem of summarizing the rating scores given to an object into an overall score that reflects the objectâ\u20AC™s quality. We observe that the existing approaches for summarizing scores largely ignores the effect of reviewers exercising different standards in assigning scores. Instead of treating all reviewers as equals, our approach models the leniency of reviewers, which refers to the tendency of a reviewer to assign higher scores than other coreviewers. Our approach is underlined by two insights: (1) The leniency of a reviewer depends not only on how the reviewer rates objects, but also on how other reviewers rate those objects and (2) The leniency of a reviewer and the quality of rated objects are mutually dependent. We develop the leniency-aware quality, or LQ model, which solves leniency and quality simultaneously. We introduce both an exact and a ranked solution to the model. Experiments on real-life and synthetic datasets show that LQ is more effective than comparable approaches. LQ is also shown to perform consistently better under different parameter settings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23244","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23245","fieldValue":" The widespread diffusion of Web-based services provided by public and private organizations emphasizes the need for a flexible solution for protecting the information accessible through Web applications. A promising approach is represented by credential-based access control and trust management. However, although much research has been done and several proposals exist, a clear obstacle to the realization of their benefits in data-intensive Web applications is represented by the lack of adequate support in the DBMSs. As a matter of fact, DBMSs are often responsible for the management of most of the information that is accessed using a Web browser or a Web service invocation. In this article, we aim at eliminating this gap, and present an approach integrating trust management with the access control of the DBMS. We propose a trust model with a SQL syntax and illustrate an algorithm for the efficient verification of a delegation path for certificates. Our solution nicely complements current trust management proposals allowing the efficient realization of the services of an advanced trust management model within current relational DBMSs. An important benefit of our approach lies in its potential for a robust end-to-end design of security for personal data in Web scenario, where vulnerabilities of Web applications cannot be used to violate the protection of the data residing on the database server. We also illustrate the implementation of our approach within an open-source DBMS discussing design choices and performance impact."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23246","fieldValue":" Dynamic selection of Web services at runtime is important for building flexible and loosely-coupled service-oriented applications. An abstract description of the required services is provided at design-time, and matching service offers are located at runtime. With the growing number of Web services that provide the same functionality but differ in quality parameters (e.g., availability, response time), a decision needs to be made on which services should be selected such that the user's end-to-end QoS requirements are satisfied. Although very efficient, local selection strategy fails short in handling global QoS requirements. Solutions based on global optimization, on the other hand, can handle global constraints, but their poor performance renders them inappropriate for applications with dynamic and realtime requirements. In this article we address this problem and propose a hybrid solution that combines global optimization with local selection techniques to benefit from the advantages of both worlds. The proposed solution consists of two steps: first, we use mixed integer programming (MIP) to find the optimal decomposition of global QoS constraints into local constraints. Second, we use distributed local selection to find the best Web services that satisfy these local constraints. The results of experimental evaluation indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of computation time while achieving close-to-optimal results."}
