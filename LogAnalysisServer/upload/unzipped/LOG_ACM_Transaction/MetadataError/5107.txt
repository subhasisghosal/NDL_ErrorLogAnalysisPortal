In this paper, we cast extractive speech summarization as an ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) problem and investigate various language modeling (LM) methods for important sentence selection. The main contributions of this paper are four-fold. First, we explore a novel sentence modeling paradigm built on top of the notion of relevance, where the relationship between a candidate summary sentence and a spoken document to be summarized is discovered through different granularities of context for relevance modeling. Second, not only lexical but also topical cues inherent in the spoken document are exploited for sentence modeling. Third, we propose a novel clarity measure for use in important sentence selection, which can help quantify the thematic specificity of each individual sentence that is deemed to be a crucial indicator orthogonal to the relevance measure provided by the LM-based methods. Fourth, in an attempt to lessen summarization performance degradation caused by imperfect speech recognition, we investigate making use of different levels of index features for LM-based sentence modeling, including words, subword-level units, and their combination. Experiments on broadcast news summarization seem to demonstrate the performance merits of our methods when compared to several existing well-developed and\/or state-of-the-art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3928","fieldValue":" This paper presents a new approach to elimination of impulsive disturbances from stereo audio recordings. The proposed solution is based on vector autoregressive modeling of audio signals. Online tracking of signal model parameters is performed using the exponentially weighted least squares algorithm. Detection of noise pulses and model-based interpolation of the irrevocably distorted samples is realized using an adaptive, variable-order Kalman filter. The proposed approach is evaluated on a set of clean audio signals contaminated with real click waveforms extracted from old gramophone recordings."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3928","fieldValue":"Elimination of impulsive disturbances from stereo audio recordings using vector autoregressive modeling and variable-order Kalman filtering"}
