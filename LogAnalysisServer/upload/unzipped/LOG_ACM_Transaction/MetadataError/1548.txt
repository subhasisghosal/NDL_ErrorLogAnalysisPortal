We present a technique for capturing and animating those motions using a commercial motion capture system and approximately 350 markers. Although the number of markers is significantly larger than that used in conventional motion capture, it is only a sparse representation of the true shape of the body. We supplement this sparse sample with a detailed, actor-specific surface model. The motion of the skin can then be computed by segmenting the markers into the motion of a set of rigid parts and a residual deformation (approximated first as a quadratic transformation and then with radial basis functions). We demonstrate the power of this approach by capturing flexing muscles, high frequency motions, and abrupt decelerations on several actors. We compare these results both to conventional motion capture and skinning and to synchronized video of the actors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15696","fieldValue":" We present a lossy compression algorithm for large databases of motion capture data. We approximate short clips of motion using Bezier curves and clustered principal component analysis. This approximation has a smoothing effect on the motion. Contacts with the environment (such as foot strikes) have important detail that needs to be maintained. We compress these environmental contacts using a separate, JPEG like compression algorithm and ensure these contacts are maintained during decompression.Our method can compress 6 hours 34 minutes of human motion capture from 1080 MB data into 35.5 MB with little visible degradation. Compression and decompression is fast: our research implementation can decompress at about 1.2 milliseconds\/frame, 7 times faster than real-time (for 120 frames per second animation). Our method also yields smaller compressed representation for the same error or produces smaller error for the same compressed size."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2488","fieldValue":" Constrained sequences are strings satisfying certain additional structural restrictions (e.g., some patterns are forbidden).
