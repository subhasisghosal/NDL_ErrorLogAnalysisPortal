To achieve good service quality for an MCS application, incentive mechanisms are necessary to attract more user participation. Most existing mechanisms apply only for the offline scenario where all users report their strategic types in advance. On the contrary, we focus on a more realistic scenario where users arrive one by one online in a random order. Based on the online auction model, we investigate the problem that users submit their private types to the crowdsourcer when arriving, and the crowdsourcer aims at selecting a subset of users before a specified deadline for maximizing the value of services (assumed to be a nonnegative monotone submodular function) provided by selected users under a budget constraint. We design two online mechanisms, OMZ and OMG, satisfying the computational efficiency, individual rationality, budget feasibility, truthfulness, consumer sovereignty, and constant competitiveness under the zero arrival-departure interval case and a more general case, respectively. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance and validate the theoretical properties of our online mechanisms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10940","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10940","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10940","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10940","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10941","fieldValue":" Opportunistic routing, offering relatively efficient and adaptive forwarding in low-duty-cycled sensor networks, generally allows multiple nodes to forward the same packet simultaneously, especially in networks with intensive traffic. Uncoordinated transmissions often incur a number of duplicate packets, which are further forwarded in the network, occupy the limited network resource, and hinder the packet delivery performance. Existing solutions to this issue, e.g., overhearing or coordination based approaches, either cannot scale up with the system size, or suffer high control overhead. We present Duplicate-Detectable Opportunistic Forwarding (DOF), a duplicate-free opportunistic forwarding protocol for low-duty-cycled wireless sensor networks. DOF enables senders to obtain the information of all potential forwarders via a slotted acknowledgment scheme, so the data packets can be sent to the deterministic next-hop forwarder. Based on light-weight coordination, DOF explores the opportunities as many as possible and removes duplicate packets from the forwarding process. We implement DOF and evaluate its performance on an indoor testbed with 20 TelosB nodes. The experimental results show that DOF reduces the average duplicate ratio by 90%, compared to state-of-the-art opportunistic protocols, and achieves 61.5% enhancement in network yield and 51.4% saving in energy consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10941","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10941","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}
