We first introduce an exact common subexpression elimination (CSE) algorithm that formalizes the minimization of the number of operations as a 0-1 integer linear programming problem. Since there are still instances that the proposed exact algorithm cannot handle due to the NP-completeness of the problem, we also introduce a CSE heuristic algorithm that iteratively finds the most common 2-term subexpressions with the minimum conflicts among the expressions. Furthermore, since the main drawback of CSE algorithms is their dependency on a particular number representation, we propose a hybrid algorithm that initially finds promising realizations of linear transforms using a numerical difference method, and then applies the proposed CSE algorithm to utilize the common subexpressions iteratively. The experimental results on a comprehensive set of instances indicate that the proposed approximate algorithms find competitive results with those of the exact CSE algorithm and obtain better solutions than the prominent, previously proposed, heuristics. It is also observed that our solutions yield significant area reductions in the design of linear transforms after circuit synthesis, compared to direct realizations of linear transforms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13247","fieldValue":"Leung, Mario K Y"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13247","fieldValue":"Chio, Eric K I"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13247","fieldValue":"Young, Evangeline F Y"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13247","fieldValue":" High power consumption will not only shorten the battery life of handheld devices, but also cause thermal and reliability problems. To lower power consumption, one way is to reduce the supply voltage as in multisupply voltage (MSV) designs. In region-based MSV, a circuit will be partitioned into â\u20ACœvoltage islandsâ\u20AC? where each island occupies a contiguous physical space and operates at one supply voltage. In the work of Wu et al. [2005], this voltage supply problem is addressed, and the input placement is partitioned into a set of rectangular voltage islands by a slicing structure. However, the constraint of using a slicing structure prohibits better solutions in their approach. In the work of Ching et al. [2006], the constraint of obtaining rectangular shapes is relaxed; their method forms islands of very irregular shapes. In this article, we propose a method that focuses on forming rectangular voltage islands to minimize the power consumption, while at the same time favoring the power routing step. It is found that, even with this reduced flexibility on island shapes, we can still perform as well as, or in some cases, even better than the previous work of Ching et al. [2006] that does not control the shapes of the islands, in terms of power saving and island number."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13247","fieldValue":"ACM"}
