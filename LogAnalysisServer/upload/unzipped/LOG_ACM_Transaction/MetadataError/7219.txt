This paper addresses the key issue of how to assign delay budgets to each network node along the routing path so that the end-to-end delay requirements of the supported applications are met. First, we describe a methodology to compute for a given flow a set of feasible per-node delays for the class of delay-based servers. We then formalize an optimal per-node delay assignment problem which takes into consideration the workload across the routing path. The solution, for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, is provided. The resulting solution is optimal, but its implementation overhead is relatively high. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose two heuristics, EPH() and LBH(), to approximate the optimal strategy. EPH() uses the equi-partition concept to compute initial delay values and adjust these delay values to meet the end-to-end delay requirements. LBH() uses a relaxation factor to distribute the load proportionally across all nodes on the routing path. A simulation-based comparative analysis shows that the heuristics perform closely to the optimal schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9256","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9257","fieldValue":" In this paper, we introduce a control theoretical analysis of the closed-loop congestion control problem in packet networks. The control theoretical approach is used in a proportional rate controller, where packets are admitted into the network in accordance with network buffer occupancy. A Smith Predictor is used to deal with large propagation delays, common to high speed backbone networks. The analytical approach leads to accurate predictions regarding both transients as well as steady-state behavior of buffers and input rates. Moreover, it exposes tradeoffs regarding buffer dimensioning, packet loss, and throughput."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9257","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9257","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9257","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9258","fieldValue":" We develop an importance sampling technique that can be used to speed up the simulation of a model of a buffered communication multiplexer fed by a large number of independent sources. The sources generate traffic according to a periodic function with a random phase. This traffic model accommodates a wide range of situations of practical interest, including ON-OFF periodic traffic models and sequences of bit rates generated by actual Variable Bit Rate sources, such as MPEG video compressors. The simulation seeks to obtain estimates for the buffer overflow probability that in most cases of interest is very small. We use a large deviations result to devise the change of measure used in the importance sampling technique and demonstrate through numerical results that this change of measure leads to a dramatic reduction in the required simulation time over direct Monte Carlo simulation. Possible practical applications include short-term network resource planning and even real-time Call Admission Control."}
