However, the experimental determination of haplotypes is expensive and time-consuming. This motivates the increasing interest in techniques for inferring haplotype data from genotypes, which can instead be obtained quickly and economically. Several such techniques are based on the maximum parsimony principle, which has been justified by both experimental results and theoretical arguments. However, the problem of haplotype inference by parsimony was shown to be NP-hard, thus limiting the applicability of exact parsimony-based techniques to relatively small data sets. In this paper, we introduce collapse rule, a generalization of the well-known Clark's rule, and describe a new heuristic algorithm for haplotype inference (implemented in a program called CollHaps), based on parsimony and the iterative application of collapse rules. The performance of CollHaps is tested on several data sets. The experiments show that CollHaps enables the user to process large data sets obtaining very â\u20ACœparsimoniousâ\u20AC? solutions in short processing times. They also show a correlation, especially for large data sets, between parsimony and correct reconstruction, supporting the validity of the parsimony principle to produce accurate solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4510","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4511","fieldValue":"Jackups Jr, Ronald"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4511","fieldValue":" Motifs are overrepresented sequence or spatial patterns appearing in proteins. They often play important roles in maintaining protein stability and in facilitating protein function. When motifs are located in short sequence fragments, as in transmembrane domains that are only 6-20 residues in length, and when there is only very limited data, it is difficult to identify motifs. In this study, we introduce combinatorial models based on permutation for assessing statistically significant sequence and spatial patterns in short sequences. We show that our method can uncover previously unknown sequence and spatial motifs in \\beta-barrel membrane proteins and that our method outperforms existing methods in detecting statistically significant motifs in this data set. Last, we discuss implications of motif analysis for problems involving short sequences in other families of proteins."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4511","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
