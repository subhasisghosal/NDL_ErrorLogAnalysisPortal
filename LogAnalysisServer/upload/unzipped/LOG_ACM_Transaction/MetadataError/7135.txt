We investigate this fundamental problem of achieving the system optimal rates in the sense of maximizing aggregate utility, in a distributed manner, using only the information available at the end hosts of the network. This is done by decomposing the overall system problem into subproblems for the network and for the individual users by introducing a pricing scheme. The users are to solve the problem of maximizing individual net utility, which is the utility less the amount they pay. We provide algorithms for the network to adjust its prices and the users to adjust their window sizes such that at an equilibrium the system optimum is achieved. Further, the equilibrium prices are such that the system optimum achieves weighted proportional fairness. It is notable that the update algorithms of the users do not require any explicit feedback from the network, rendering them easily deployable over the Internet. Our scheme is incentive compatible in that there is no benefit to the users to lie about their utilities."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9092","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9092","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9092","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9092","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9093","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a protocol for scheduling of packets in high-capacity switches, termed weighted sequential greedy scheduling (WSGS). WSGS is a simple, greedy algorithm that uses credits to reserve bandwidth for input-output pairs. By using a pipeline technique, WSGS implemented by the current technology readily supports a switching capacity exceeding 1 Tb\/s. Admission control is straightforward, allowing bandwidth reservations on a submillisecond time scale. Namely, the central controller readily determines if the newly requested bandwidth can be assigned to the given input-output pair. We have shown that a newly requested bandwidth should be assigned if both the input and output have enough capacity, which requires checking of only two inequalities. Therefore, WSGS is well suited for switching in data networks where sessions might require high bit rates and last for a short time. The WSGS allows bandwidth reservations with fine granularity, e.g., bandwidth can be reserved for individual web sessions, video streams, etc."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9093","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9093","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}
