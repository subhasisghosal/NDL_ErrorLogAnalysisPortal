Recent advances in computer graphics techniques have made it possible to render many varieties of stylized imagery efficiently making stylization into a useful technique, not only for artistic, but also for visualization applications. In this paper, we report results from two sets of experiments that aim at characterizing the perceptual impact and effectiveness of three different stylization techniques in the context of dynamic facial expressions. In the first set of experiments, animated facial expressions are stylized using three common techniques (brush, cartoon, and illustrative stylization) and investigated using different experimental measures. Going beyond the usual questionnaire approach, these experiments compare the techniques according to several criteria ranging from subjective preference to task-dependent measures (such as recognizability, intensity) allowing us to compare behavioral and introspective approaches. The second set of experiments use the same stylization techniques on real-world video sequences in order to compare the effect of stylization on natural and artificial stimuli. Our results shed light on how stylization of image contents affects the perception and subjective evaluation of both real and computer-generated facial expressions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23747","fieldValue":" In this article we show how probabilistic information retrieval based on document components may be implemented as a feedforward (feedbackward) artificial neural network. The network supports adaptation of connection weights as well as the growing of new edges between queries and terms based on user relevance feedback data for training, and it reflects query modification and expansion in information retrieval. A learning rule is applied that can also be viewed as supporting sequential learning using a harmonic sequence learning rate. Experimental results with four standard small collections and a large Wall Street Journal collection (173,219 documents) show that performance of feedback improves substantially over no feedback, and further gains are obtained when queries are expanded with terms from the feedback documents. The effect is much more pronounced in small collections than in the large collection. Query expansion may be considered as a tool for both precision and recall enhancement. In particular, small query expansion levels of about 30 terms can achieve most of the gains at the low-recall high-precision region, while larger expansion levels continue to provide gains at the high-recall low-precision region of a precision recall curve."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23748","fieldValue":" In order to extend the ability to handle incomplete information in a definite deductive database, a Horn clause-based system representing incomplete information as incomplete constants is proposed. By using the notion of incomplete constants the deductive database system handles incomplete information in the form of sets of possible values, thereby giving more information than null values. The resulting system extends Horn logic to express a restricted form of indefiniteness. Although a deductive database with this kind of incomplete information is, in fact, a subset of an indefinite deductive database system, it represents indefiniteness in terms of value incompleteness, and therefore it can make use of the existing Horn logic computation rules. The inference rules for such a system are presented, its model theory discussed, and a model theory of indefiniteness proposed. The theory is consistent with minimal model theory and extends its expressive power."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23748","fieldValue":"ACM"}
