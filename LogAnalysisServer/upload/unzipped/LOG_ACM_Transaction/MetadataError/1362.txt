The framework provides a conceptual and mathematical foundation for analyzing known warps and for developing new warps, and serves as a common base for many warps and deformations. Our framework is composed of two components: a generic modular algorithm for warps and deformations; and a concise, geometrically meaningful formula that describes how warps are evaluated. Together, these two elements comprise a complete framework useful for analyzing, evaluating, designing, and implementing deformation algorithms. While the framework is independent of user-interfaces and geometric model representations and is formally capable of describing any warping algorithm, its design is geared toward the most prevalent class of user-controlled deformations: those computed using geometric operations. To demonstrate the expressive power of the framework, we cast several well-known warps in terms of the framework. To illustrate the framework's usefulness for analyzing and modifying existing warps, we present variations of these warps that provide additional functionality or improved behavior. To show the utility of the framework for developing new warps, we design a novel 3-D warping algorithm: a mesh warp---useful as a modeling and animation tool---that allows users to deform a detailed surface by manipulating a low-resolution mesh of similar shape. Finally, to demonstrate the mathematical utility of the framework, we use the framework to develop guarantees of several mathematical properties such as commutativity and continuity for large classes of deformations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15206","fieldValue":" Today's computer graphics is ostensibly based upon insights from projective geometry and computations on homogeneous coordinates. Paradoxically, however, projective spaces and homogeneous coordinates are incompatible with much of the algebra and a good deal of the geometry currently in actual use in computer graphics. To bridge this gulf between theory and practice, Grassmann spaces are proposed here as an alternative to projective spaces. We establish that unlike projective spaces, Grassmann spaces do support all the algebra and geometry needed for contemporary computer graphics. We then go on to explain how to exploit this algebra and geometry for a variety of applications, both old and new, including the graphics pipeline, shading algorithms, texture maps, and overcrown surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15207","fieldValue":" I've now been Editor-in-Chief of ACM TOG for two full years. We've made a number of changes in TOG recently. Perhaps the most visible change is the new format which began with January 2002. The format change is to more closely approximate that of ACM SIGGRAPH.The July 2002 issue of TOG will be the Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH. These papers will be conditionally accepted at the SIGGRAPH Program Committee meeting in March 2002 and then will undergo a second reviewing phase in which a referee will ensure that the authors have altered the paper to address the concerns of the original reviewers. This referee's job will be much like that of the associate editor in the normal TOG review process.As you have no doubt noticed, publication of TOG has not kept pace with the calendar. However, the number of submissions has increased substantially (57 in 2001 versus 34 in 2000) and the time until the authors receive the first decision on their paper has been reduced to less than four months for almost every paper. We should be publishing on time by the next regular issue, October 2002, and will then be able to start building a backlog of accepted papers at ACM to keep the issues on schedule.This improvement has been made possible by the hard work of the Associate Editors listed in the front cover of the journal and by the reviewers who are listed at the end of this issue. I'm very grateful to both groups for their significant help throughout the year.I hope that the next year sees another 50&percnt; or larger increase in the number of submissions. I would be happy to have twice as much work to do so please keep sending those strong submissions our way."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15207","fieldValue":"Editorial"}
