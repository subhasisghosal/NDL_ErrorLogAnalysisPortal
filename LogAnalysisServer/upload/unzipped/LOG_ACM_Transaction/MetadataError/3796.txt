In previous work, we analyzed the success of such attacks under various assumptions. Here, we evaluate the effects of these assumptions more closely. First, we analyze the Onion Routing-based model used in prior work in which a fixed set of nodes remains in the system indefinitely. We show that for this model, by removing the assumption of uniformly random selection of nodes for placement in the path, initiators can greatly improve their anonymity. Second, we show by simulation that attack times are significantly lower in practice than bounds given by analytical results from prior work. Third, we analyze the effects of a dynamic membership model, in which nodes are allowed to join and leave the system; we show that all known defenses fail more quickly when the assumption of a static node set is relaxed. Fourth, intersection attacks against peer-to-peer systems are shown to be an additional danger, either on their own or in conjunction with the predecessor attack. Finally, we address the question of whether the regular communication patterns required by the attacks exist in real traffic. We collected and analyzed the Web requests of users to determine the extent to which basic patterns can be found. We show that, for our study, frequent and repeated communication to the same Web site is common."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22238","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22238","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3122","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a new framework for segmentation of Bangla handwritten word images into meaningful individual symbols or pseudo-characters. Existing segmentation algorithms are not usually treated as a classification problem. However, in the present study, the segmentation algorithm is looked upon as a two-class supervised classification problem. The method employs an SVM classifier to select the segmentation points on the word image on the basis of various structural features. For training of the SVM classifier, an unannotated training set is prepared first using candidate segmenting points. The training set is then clustered, and each cluster is labeled manually with minimal manual intervention. A semi-automatic bootstrapping technique is also employed to enlarge the training set from new samples. The overall architecture describes a basic step toward building an annotation system for the segmentation problem, which has not so far been investigated. The experimental results show that our segmentation method is quite efficient in segmenting not only word images but also handwritten texts. As a part of this work, a database of Bangla handwritten word images has also been developed. Considering our data collection method and a statistical analysis of our lexicon set, we claim that the relevant characteristics of an ideal lexicon set are present in our handwritten word image database."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3122","fieldValue":"Bangla Handwritten Character Segmentation Using Structural Features: A Supervised and Bootstrapping Approach"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3122","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3122","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22239","fieldValue":" A timed-release cryptosystem allows a sender to encrypt a message so that only the intended recipient can read it only after a specified time. We formalize the concept of a secure timed-release public-key cryptosystem and show that, if a third party is relied upon to guarantee decryption after the specified date, this concept is equivalent to identity-based encryption; this explains the observation that all known constructions use identity-based encryption to achieve timed-release security. We then give several provably-secure constructions of timed-release encryption: a generic scheme based on any identity-based encryption scheme, and two more efficient schemes based on the existence of cryptographically admissible bilinear mappings. The first of these is essentially as efficient as the Boneh-Franklin Identity-Based encryption scheme, and is provably secure and authenticated in the random oracle model; the final scheme is not authenticated but is provably secure in the standard model (i.e., without random oracles)."}
