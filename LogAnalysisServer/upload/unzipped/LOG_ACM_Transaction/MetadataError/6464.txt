This problem has been addressed either by using function approximation techniques that estimate the approximate true value function of a policy or by using a hierarchical decomposition of a learning task into subtasks. We present a novel approach for dialogue policy optimization that combines the benefits of both hierarchical control and function approximation and that allows flexible transitions between dialogue subtasks to give human users more control over the dialogue. To this end, each reinforcement learning agent in the hierarchy is extended with a subtask transition function and a dynamic state space to allow flexible switching between subdialogues. In addition, the subtask policies are represented with linear function approximation in order to generalize the decision making to situations unseen in training. Our proposed approach is evaluated in an interactive conversational robot that learns to play quiz games. Experimental results, using simulation and real users, provide evidence that our proposed approach can lead to more flexible (natural) interactions than strict hierarchical control and that it is preferred by human users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7198","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7198","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7199","fieldValue":" Recognising high-level human activities from low-level sensor data is a crucial driver for pervasive systems that wish to provide seamless and distraction-free support for users engaged in normal activities. Research in this area has grown alongside advances in sensing and communications, and experiments have yielded sensor traces coupled with ground truth annotations about the underlying environmental conditions and user actions. Traditional machine learning has had some success in recognising human activities; but the need for large volumes of annotated data and the danger of overfitting to specific conditions represent challenges in connection with the building of models applicable to a wide range of users, activities, and environments. We present USMART, a novel unsupervised technique that combines data- and knowledge-driven techniques. USMART uses a general ontology model to represent domain knowledge that can be reused across different environments and users, and we augment a range of learning techniques with ontological semantics to facilitate the unsupervised discovery of patterns in how each user performs daily activities. We evaluate our approach against four real-world third-party datasets featuring different user populations and sensor configurations, and we find that USMART achieves up to 97.5&percnt; accuracy in recognising daily activities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7199","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7199","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1657","fieldValue":"Ronne, Jeffery von"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1657","fieldValue":" Although one might expect transportation formats based on static single-assignment form (SSA) to yield faster just-in-time compilation times than those based on stack-based virtual machines, this claim has not previously been validated, in practice.

Performance results, measured with various optimizations and on both the IA32 and PowerPC, show improvements in both compilation time and code quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1657","fieldValue":"ACM"}
