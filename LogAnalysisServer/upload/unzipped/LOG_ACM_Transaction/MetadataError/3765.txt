We show that traditional security mechanisms do not properly address the needs of a secured collaboration and present a research prototype, called NGC (next generation collaboration), that was designed to meet those needs. NGC distinguishes itself in the care with which the man-machine process was analyzed and shaped to improve the security of the whole process. We include a detailed analysis of the problem of binding a name to a key, traditionally thought to be the province of PKI, but we show that the SDSI local name concept produces a result with superior security to that produced by standard PKI."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22160","fieldValue":"PGP"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22160","fieldValue":"PKI"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22160","fieldValue":"S\/MIME"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22160","fieldValue":"SDSI"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22160","fieldValue":"SPKI"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22160","fieldValue":"SSH"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22160","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22160","fieldValue":"ACM"}
