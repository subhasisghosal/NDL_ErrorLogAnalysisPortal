Communication in such designs is often enabled by Networks-on-Chip (NoCs). A new trend in such architectures is to fit a Message Passing Interface (MPI) programming model on NoCs to achieve optimal parallel application performance. A key issue in designing MPI over NoCs is communication protocol, which has not been explored in previous research. This article advocates a hardware-supported communication mechanism using a protocol-adaptive approach to adjust to varying NoC configurations (e.g., number of buffers) and workload behavior (e.g., number of messages). We propose the ADaptive Communication Mechanism (ADCM), a hybrid protocol that involves behavior similar to buffered communication when sufficient buffer is available in the receiver to that similar to a synchronous protocol when buffers in the receiver are limited. ADCM adapts dynamically by deciding communication protocol on a per-request basis using a local estimate of recent buffer utilization. ADCM attempts to combine both the advantages of buffered and synchronous communication modes to achieve enhanced throughput and performance. Simulations of various workloads show that the proposed communication mechanism can be effectively used in future NoC designs."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1859","fieldValue":"MPI"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9519","fieldValue":" Service prioritization among different traffic classes is an important goal for the Internet. Conventional approaches to solving this problem consider the existing best-effort class as the low-priority class, and attempt to develop mechanisms that provide \"better-than-best-effort\" service. In this paper, we explore the opposite approach, and devise a new distributed algorithm to realize a low-priority service (as compared to the existing best effort) from the network endpoints. To this end, we develop TCP Low Priority (TCP-LP), a distributed algorithm whose goal is to utilize only the excess network bandwidth as compared to the \"fair share\" of bandwidth as targeted by TCP. The key mechanisms unique to TCP-LP congestion control are the use of one-way packet delays for early congestion indications and a TCP-transparent congestion avoidance policy. The results of our simulation and Internet experiments show that: 1) TCP-LP is largely non-intrusive to TCP traffic; 2) both single and aggregate TCP-LP flows are able to successfully utilize excess network bandwidth; moreover, multiple TCP-LP flows share excess bandwidth fairly; 3) substantial amounts of excess bandwidth are available to the low-priority class, even in the presence of \"greedy\" TCP flows; 4) the response times of web connections in the best-effort class decrease by up to 90% when long-lived bulk data transfers use TCP-LP rather than TCP; 5) despite their low-priority nature, TCP-LP flows are able to utilize significant amounts of available bandwidth in a wide-area network environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9519","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9519","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9519","fieldValue":"TCP-LP"}
