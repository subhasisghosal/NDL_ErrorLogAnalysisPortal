However, selecting the optimal setting that guarantees the application reliability requirements, with minimum energy consumption, is not a trivial task in wireless sensor networks, especially when the operating conditions change over time. In this paper we propose a Just-in-Time LEarning-based Adaptive Parameter tuning (JIT-LEAP) algorithm that adapts the CSMA\/CA parameter setting to the time-varying operating conditions by also exploiting the past history to find the most appropriate setting for the current conditions. Following the approach of active adaptive algorithms, the adaptation mechanism of JIT-LEAP is triggered by a change detection test only when needed (i.e., in response to a change in the operating conditions). Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other similar algorithms, both in stationary and dynamic scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1337","fieldValue":"CSMA\/CA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4391","fieldValue":" The cDNA microarray is an important tool for generating large datasets of gene expression measurements.An efficient design is critical to ensure that the experiment will be able to address relevant biologicalquestions. Microarray experimental design can be treated as a multicriterion optimization problem. For thisclass of problems evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are well suited, as they can search the solution space andevolve a design that optimizes the parameters of interest based on their relative value to the researcher undera given set of constraints. This paper introduces the use of EAs for optimization of experimental designs ofspotted microarrays using a weighted objective function. The EA and the various criteria relevant to designoptimization are discussed. Evolved designs are compared with designs obtained through exhaustive searchwith results suggesting that the EA can find just as efficient optimal or near-optimal designs within atractable timeframe."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4391","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4391","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4391","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4121","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
