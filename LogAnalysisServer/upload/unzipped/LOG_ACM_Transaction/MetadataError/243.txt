{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11689","fieldValue":" In a recently launched research program for developing logic as a formal theory of (interactive) computability, several very interesting logics have been introduced and axiomatized. These fragments of the larger Computability Logic aim not only to describe what can be computed, but also provide a mechanism for extracting computational algorithms from proofs. Among the most expressive and fundamental of these is CL4, known to be (constructively) sound and complete with respect to the underlying computational semantics. Furthermore, the ‚à\u20AC, &exists;-free fragment of CL4 was shown to be decidable in polynomial space. The present work extends this result and proves that this fragment is, in fact, PSPACE-complete."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11690","fieldValue":"Buss, Samuel R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11690","fieldValue":" This article concerns the second-order systems $$U^1_2 and V12 of bounded arithmetic, which have proof-theoretic strengths corresponding to polynomial-space and exponential-time computation. We formulate improved witnessing theorems for these two theories by using S12 as a base theory for proving the correctness of the polynomial-space or exponential-time witnessing functions. We develop the theory of nondeterministic polynomial-space computation, including Savitch's theorem, in U12. Ko≈\u201Aodziejczyk et al. [2011] have introduced local improvement properties to characterize the provably total NP functions of these second-order theories. We show that the strengths of their local improvement principles over U12 and V12 depend primarily on the topology of the underlying graph, not the number of rounds in the local improvement games. The theory U12 proves the local improvement principle for linear graphs even without restricting to logarithmically many rounds. The local improvement principle for grid graphs with only logarithmically-many rounds is complete for the provably total NP search problems of V1$2$. Related results are obtained for local improvement principles with one improvement round and for local improvement over rectangular grids."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11691","fieldValue":"Rutten, Jan J M M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11691","fieldValue":" We give a new presentation of Brzozowski's algorithm to minimize finite automata using elementary facts from universal algebra and coalgebra and building on earlier work by Arbib and Manes on a categorical presentation of Kalman duality between reachability and observability.
