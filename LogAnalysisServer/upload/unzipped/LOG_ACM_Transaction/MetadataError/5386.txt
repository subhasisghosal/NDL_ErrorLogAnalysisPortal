This information can be used to understand the genetic regulatory network that generates the data. Typically, Bayesian analysis approaches are applied which neglect the time series nature of the experimental data, have difficulty in determining the direction of causality, and do not perform well on networks with tight feedback. To address these problems, this paper presents a method to learn genetic network connectivity which exploits the time series nature of experimental data to achieve better causal predictions. This method first breaks up the data into bins. Next, it determines an initial set of potential influence vectors for each gene based upon the probability of the gene's expression increasing in the next time step. These vectors are then combined to form new vectors with better scores. Finally, these influence vectors are competed against each other to determine the final influence vector for each gene. The result is a directed graph representation of the genetic network's repression and activation connections. Results are reported for several synthetic networks with tight feedback showing significant improvements in recall and runtime over Yu's dynamic Bayesian approach. Promising preliminary results are also reported for an analysis of experimental data for genes involved in the yeast cell cycle."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4550","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4551","fieldValue":"de Jong, Hidde"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4551","fieldValue":" The adaptation of the bacterium Escherichia coli to carbon starvation is controlled by a large network of biochemical reactions involving genes, mRNAs, proteins, and signalling molecules. The dynamics of these networks is difficult to analyze, notably due to a lack of quantitative information on parameter values. To overcome these limitations, model reduction approaches based on quasi-steady-state (QSS) and piecewise-linear (PL) approximations have been proposed, resulting in models that are easier to handle mathematically and computationally. These approximations are not supposed to affect the capability of the model to account for essential dynamical properties of the system, but the validity of this assumption has not been systematically tested. In this paper, we carry out such a study by evaluating a large and complex PL model of the carbon starvation response in E. coli using an ensemble approach. The results show that, in comparison with conventional nonlinear models, the PL approximations generally preserve the dynamics of the carbon starvation response network, although with some deviations concerning notably the quantitative precision of the model predictions. This encourages the application of PL models to the qualitative analysis of bacterial regulatory networks, in situations where the reference time scale is that of protein synthesis and degradation."}
