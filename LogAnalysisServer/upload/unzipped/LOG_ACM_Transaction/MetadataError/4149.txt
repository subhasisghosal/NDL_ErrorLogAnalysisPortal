Here, we demonstrate that cognitive (â\u20ACœtop-downâ\u20AC?) mechanisms like ecological relevance and presence evoked by a virtual environment can also enhance visually induced self-motion illusions (vection). In two experiments, naive observers were asked to rate presence and the onset, intensity, and convincingness of circular vection induced by different rotating visual stimuli presented on a curved projection screen (FOV: 54Â° Ã\u2014 45Â°). Globally consistent stimuli depicting a natural 3D scene proved more effective in inducing vection and presence than inconsistent (scrambled) or unnatural (upside-down) stimuli with similar physical stimulus properties. Correlation analyses suggest a direct relationship between spatial presence and vection. We propose that the coherent pictorial depth cues and the spatial reference frame evoked by the naturalistic environment increased the believability of the visual stimulus, such that it was more easily accepted as a stable â\u20ACœsceneâ\u20AC? with respect to which visual motion is more likely to be judged as self-motion than object motion. This work extends our understanding of mechanisms underlying self-motion perception and might thus help to improve the effectiveness and believability of virtual reality applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3278","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3278","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23349","fieldValue":" With the booming popularity of online social networks like Twitter and Weibo, online user footprints are accumulating rapidly on the social web. Simultaneously, the question of how to leverage the large-scale user-generated social media data for personal credit scoring comes into the sight of both researchers and practitioners. It has also become a topic of great importance and growing interest in the P2P lending industry. However, compared with traditional financial data, heterogeneous social data presents both opportunities and challenges for personal credit scoring. In this article, we seek a deep understanding of how to learn usersâ\u20AC™ credit labels from social data in a comprehensive and efficient way. Particularly, we explore the social-data-based credit scoring problem under the micro-blogging setting for its open, simple, and real-time nature. To identify credit-related evidence hidden in social data, we choose to conduct an analytical and empirical study on a large-scale dataset from Weibo, the largest and most popular tweet-style website in China. Summarizing results from existing credit scoring literature, we first propose three social-data-based credit scoring principles as guidelines for in-depth exploration. In addition, we glean six credit-related insights arising from empirical observations of the testbed dataset. Based on the proposed principles and insights, we extract prediction features mainly from three categories of usersâ\u20AC™ social data, including demographics, tweets, and networks. To harness this broad range of features, we put forward a two-tier stacking and boosting enhanced ensemble learning framework. Quantitative investigation of the extracted features shows that online social media data does have good potential in discriminating good credit users from bad. Furthermore, we perform experiments on the real-world Weibo dataset consisting of more than 7.3 million tweets and 200,000 users whose credit labels are known through our third-party partner. Experimental results show that (i) our approach achieves a roughly 0.625 AUC value with all the proposed social features as input, and (ii) our learning algorithm can outperform traditional credit scoring methods by as much as 17% for social-data-based personal credit scoring."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23349","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23349","fieldValue":"ACM"}
