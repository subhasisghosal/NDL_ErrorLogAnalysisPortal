Research in this area has grown alongside advances in sensing and communications, and experiments have yielded sensor traces coupled with ground truth annotations about the underlying environmental conditions and user actions. Traditional machine learning has had some success in recognising human activities; but the need for large volumes of annotated data and the danger of overfitting to specific conditions represent challenges in connection with the building of models applicable to a wide range of users, activities, and environments. We present USMART, a novel unsupervised technique that combines data- and knowledge-driven techniques. USMART uses a general ontology model to represent domain knowledge that can be reused across different environments and users, and we augment a range of learning techniques with ontological semantics to facilitate the unsupervised discovery of patterns in how each user performs daily activities. We evaluate our approach against four real-world third-party datasets featuring different user populations and sensor configurations, and we find that USMART achieves up to 97.5&percnt; accuracy in recognising daily activities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7204","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7204","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7205","fieldValue":" In many cases, visitors come to a museum in small groups. In such cases, the visitorsâ\u20AC™ social context has an impact on their museum visit experience. Knowing the social context may allow a system to provide socially aware services to the visitors. Evidence of the social context can be gained from observing\/monitoring the visitorsâ\u20AC™ social behavior. However, automatic identification of a social context requires, on the one hand, identifying typical social behavior patterns and, on the other, using relevant sensors that measure various signals and reason about them to detect the visitorsâ\u20AC™ social behavior. We present such typical social behavior patterns of visitor pairs, identified by observations, and then the instrumentation, detection process, reasoning, and analysis of measured signals that enable us to detect the visitorsâ\u20AC™ social behavior. Simple sensorsâ\u20AC™ data, such as proximity to other visitors, proximity to museum points of interest, and visitor orientation are used to detect social synchronization, attention to the social companion, and interest in museum exhibits. The presented approach may allow future research to offer adaptive services to museum visitors based on their social context to support their group visit experience better."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/7205","fieldValue":"Museum visitors&rsquo; behavior"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7205","fieldValue":"ACM"}
