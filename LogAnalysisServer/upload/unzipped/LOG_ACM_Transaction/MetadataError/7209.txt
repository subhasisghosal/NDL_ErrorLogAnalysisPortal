However, the real-time multimedia traffic transport requires rate control deployment to protect shared Internet from unfairness and further congestion collapse. The transmission rate control method must also achieve high throughput and satisfy multimedia requirements such as delay or jitter bound. However, the existing solutions are mostly for the wired Internet, and hence, they do not address the challenges in the wireless environments which are characterized by high bit error rates. In this paper, a new analytical rate control (ARC) protocol for real-time multimedia traffic over wireless networks is presented. It is intended to achieve high throughput and multimedia support for real-time traffic flows while preserving fairness to the TCP sources sharing the same wired link resources. Based on the end-to-end path model, the desired behavior of a TCP source over lossy links is captured via renewal theory. The resulting asymptotic throughput equation is designated as the driving equation for the proposed rate control method. Performance evaluation via simulation experiments reveals that ARC achieves high throughput and meets multimedia traffic expectations without violating good citizenship rules for the shared Internet."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9237","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9237","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9237","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9238","fieldValue":" Based on network circulation formulation, the existence of feasible beam-to-beam switching modes for a satellite-switched time-division multiple access system is completely and transparently proved, where simultaneous transmissions on several carriers in each spot-beam are configured. Showing the linear independence of all but one augmented switching modes, a new bound of mn + 2 is obtained on the number of switching modes, where m and n are the number of up-link and down-link beams, respectively. The time complexity for finding the whole sequence of switching modes and for finding the initial switching mode are improved to $O(m2n^2), and O(min(âˆšK,(m+n)2\/3$,mn) respectively. Practical implementation considerations are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9238","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9238","fieldValue":"ACM"}
