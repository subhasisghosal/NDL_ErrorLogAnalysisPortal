To incorporate knowledge of the pathways into the model, we define a set of activities of pathways from microarray gene expression data based on the Sparse Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (SPPCA). A pathway activity logistic regression model is then formulated for cancer phenotype. To select pathway activities related to binary cancer phenotypes, we use the elastic net for the parameter estimation and derive a model selection criterion for selecting tuning parameters included in the model estimation. Our proposed method can also reverse-engineer gene networks based on the identified multiple pathways that enables us to discover novel gene-gene associations relating with the cancer phenotypes. We illustrate the whole process of the proposed method through the analysis of breast cancer gene expression data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4780","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4780","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4780","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4781","fieldValue":" Gene expression models play a key role to understand the mechanisms of gene regulation whose aspects are grade and switch-like responses. Though many stochastic approaches attempt to explain the gene expression mechanisms, the Gillespie algorithm which is commonly used to simulate the stochastic models requires additional gene cascade to explain the switch-like behaviors of gene responses. In this study, we propose a stochastic gene expression model describing the switch-like behaviors of a gene by employing Hill functions to the conventional Gillespie algorithm. We assume eight processes of gene expression and their biologically appropriate reaction rates are estimated based on published literatures. We observed that the state of the system of the toggled switch model is rarely changed since the Hill function prevents the activation of involved proteins when their concentrations stay below a criterion. In ScbA-ScbR system, which can control the antibiotic metabolite production of microorganisms, our modified Gillespie algorithm successfully describes the switch-like behaviors of gene responses and oscillatory expressions which are consistent with the published experimental study."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4781","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4781","fieldValue":"Stochastic gene expression modeling, gene regulatory networks, switch-like gene responses, Gillespie algorithm."}
