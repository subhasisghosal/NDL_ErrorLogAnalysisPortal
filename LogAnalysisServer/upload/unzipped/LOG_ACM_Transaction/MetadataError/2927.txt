Many implementations of biological sequence alignment algorithms have been proposed for multicores, GPUs, FPGAs and CellBEs. These implementations are platform-specific; porting them to other systems requires considerable programming effort. This article proposes and evaluates MASA, a flexible and customizable software architecture that enables the execution of biological sequence alignment applications with three variants (local, global, and semiglobal) in multiple hardware\/software platforms with block pruning, which is able to reduce significantly the amount of data processed. To attain our flexibility goals, we also propose a generic version of block pruning and developed multiple parallelization strategies as building blocks, including a new asynchronous dataflow-based parallelization, which may be combined to implement efficient aligners in different platforms. We provide four MASA aligner implementations for multicores (OmpSs and OpenMP), GPU (CUDA), and Intel Phi (OpenMP), showing that MASA is very flexible. The evaluation of our generic block pruning strategy shows that it significantly outperforms the previously proposed block pruning, being able to prune up to 66.5&percnt; of the cells when using the new dataflow-based parallelization strategy."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19541","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19541","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19541","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2889","fieldValue":" A selectional restriction specifies what combinations of words are semantically valid in a particular syntactic construction. This is one of the basic and important pieces of knowledge in natural language processing and has been used for syntactic and word sense disambiguation. In the case of acquiring the selectional restriction for many combinations of words from a corpus, it is necessary to estimate whether or not a word combination that is not observed in the corpus satisfies the selectional restriction. This paper proposes a new method for estimating the degree of satisfaction of the selectional restriction for a word combination from a tagged corpus, based on the multiple regression model. The independent variables of this model correspond to modifiers. Unlike a conventional multiple regression analysis, the independent variables are also parameters to be learned. We experiment on estimating the degree of satisfaction of the selectional restriction for Japanese word combinations 〈noun, postpositional-particle, verb〉. The experimental results indicate that our method estimates the degree of satisfaction of a word combination not very well observed in the corpus, and that the accuracy of syntactic disambiguation using the co-occurrencies estimated by our method is higher than using co-occurrence probabilities smoothed by previous methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2889","fieldValue":"ACM"}
