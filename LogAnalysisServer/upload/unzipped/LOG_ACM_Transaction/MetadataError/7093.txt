State-of-the-art translation proposals typically optimize a single aspect of translation performance (e.g., translation sharing, context switch performance, etc.) with potential trade-offs of additional hardware complexity, increased translation latency, or reduced scalability. In this article, we propose the partial sharing TLB (PS-TLB), a fast and scalable solution that reduces off-chip translation misses without sacrificing the timing-critical requirement of on-chip translation. We introduce the partial sharing buffer (PSB) which leverages application page sharing characteristics using minimal additional hardware resources. Compared to the leading TLB proposal that leverages sharing, PS-TLB provides a more than 45&percnt; improvement in translation latency with a 9&percnt; application speedup while using fewer storage resources. In addition, the page classification and PS-TLB architecture provide further optimizations including an over 30&percnt; reduction of interprocessor interrupts for coherence, and reduced context switch misses with fewer resources compared with existing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1808","fieldValue":"PS-TLB: Leveraging page classification information for fast, scalable and efficient translation for future CMPs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9013","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9013","fieldValue":"ACM"}
