In this article, we address these prospects with respect to human skin, one of the most ubiquitous materials portrayed in synthetic imaging. We present the first hyperspectral model designed for the predictive rendering of skin appearance attributes in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared domains. The proposed model incorporates the intrinsic bio-optical properties of human skin affecting light transport in these spectral regions, including the particle nature and distribution patterns of the main light attenuation agents found within the cutaneous tissues. Accordingly, it accounts for phenomena that significantly affect skin spectral signatures, both within and outside the visible domain, such as detour and sieve effects, that are overlooked by existing skin appearance models. Using a first-principles approach, the proposed model computes the surface and subsurface scattering components of skin reflectance taking into account not only the wavelength and the illumination geometry, but also the positional dependence of the reflected light. Hence, the spectral and spatial distributions of light interacting with human skin can be comprehensively represented in terms of hyperspectral reflectance and BSSRDF, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17280","fieldValue":" We present a solution method that, compared to the traditional Gauss-Seidel approach, reduces the time required to simulate the dynamics of large systems of rigid bodies interacting through frictional contact by one to two orders of magnitude. Unlike Gauss-Seidel, it can be easily parallelized, which allows for the physics-based simulation of systems with millions of bodies. The proposed accelerated projected gradient descent (APGD) method relies on an approach by Nesterov in which a quadratic optimization problem with conic constraints is solved at each simulation time step to recover the normal and friction forces present in the system. The APGD method is validated against experimental data, compared in terms of speed of convergence and solution time with the Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods, and demonstrated in conjunction with snow modeling, bulldozer dynamics, and several benchmark tests that highlight the interplay between the friction and cohesion forces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17280","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17280","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17281","fieldValue":"Averbuch-Elor, Hadar"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17281","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}
