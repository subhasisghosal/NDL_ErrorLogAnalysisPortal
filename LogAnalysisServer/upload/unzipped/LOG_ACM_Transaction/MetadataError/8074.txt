It has been shown that CC has the potential to significantly increase the capacity of wireless networks, with its ability of mitigating fading by exploiting spatial diversity. However, most of the works on CC are limited to single radio wireless network. To demonstrate the benefits of CC in multiradio multihop wireless network, this paper studies a joint problem of multiradio cooperative routing and relay assignment to maximize the minimum rate among a set of concurrent communication sessions. We first model this problem as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem and prove it to be NP-hard. Then, we propose a centralized algorithm and a distributed algorithm to solve the problem. The centralized algorithm is designed within a branch-and-bound framework by using the relaxation of the formulated MIP, which can find a global (1 + Îµ)-optimal solution. Our distributed algorithm includes two subalgorithms: a cooperative route selection subalgorithm and a fairness-aware route adjustment subalgorithm. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the significant rate gains that can be achieved by incorporating CC in multiradio multihop networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10955","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10955","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10955","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10955","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10956","fieldValue":"Lui, John C S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10956","fieldValue":" With wide application of virtualization technology, tenants are able to access isolated cloud services by renting the shared resources in Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) datacenters. Unlike resources such as CPU and memory, datacenter network, which relies on traditional transport-layer protocols, suffers unfairness due to a lack of virtual machine (VM)-level bandwidth guarantees. In this paper, we model the datacenter bandwidth allocation as a cooperative game, toward VM-based fairness across the datacenter with two main objectives: 1) guarantee bandwidth for VMs based on their base bandwidth requirements, and 2) share residual bandwidth in proportion to the weights of VMs. Through a bargaining game approach, we propose a bandwidth allocation algorithm, Falloc, to achieve the asymmetric Nash bargaining solution (NBS) in datacenter networks, which exactly meets our objectives. The cooperative structure of the algorithm is exploited to develop an online algorithm for practical real-world implementation. We validate Falloc with experiments under diverse scenarios and show that by adapting to different network requirements of VMs, Falloc can achieve fairness among VMs and balance the tradeoff between bandwidth guarantee and proportional bandwidth sharing. Our large-scale trace-driven simulations verify that Falloc achieves high utilization while maintaining fairness among VMs in datacenters."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10956","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10956","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}
