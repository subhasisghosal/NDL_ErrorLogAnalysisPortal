Suggesting adequate terms is a challenging issue. Most existing commercial search engines suggest search terms based on the frequency of prior used terms that match the leading alphabets the user types. In this article, we present a novel mechanism to construct semantic term-relation graphs to suggest relevant search terms in the semantic level. We built term-relation graphs based on multipartite networks of existing social media, especially from Wikipedia. The multipartite linkage networks of contributor-term, term-category, and term-term are extracted from Wikipedia to eventually form term relation graphs. For fusing these multipartite linkage networks, we propose to incorporate the contributor-category networks to model the expertise of the contributors. Based on our experiments, this step has demonstrated clear enhancement on the accuracy of the inferred relatedness of the term-semantic graphs. Experiments on keyword-expanded search based on 200 TREC-5 ad-hoc topics showed obvious advantage of our algorithms over existing approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7536","fieldValue":"Zhou, Zhi-Hua"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7536","fieldValue":" Ever-increasing design complexity and advances of technology impose great challenges on the design of modern microprocessors. One such challenge is to determine promising microprocessor configurations to meet specific design constraints, which is called Design Space Exploration (DSE). In the computer architecture community, supervised learning techniques have been applied to DSE to build regression models for predicting the qualities of design configurations. For supervised learning, however, considerable simulation costs are required for attaining the labeled design configurations. Given limited resources, it is difficult to achieve high accuracy. In this article, inspired by recent advances in semisupervised learning and active learning, we propose the COAL approach which can exploit unlabeled design configurations to significantly improve the models. Empirical study demonstrates that COAL significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art DSE technique by reducing mean squared error by 35&percnt; to 95&percnt;, and thus, promising architectures can be attained more efficiently."}
