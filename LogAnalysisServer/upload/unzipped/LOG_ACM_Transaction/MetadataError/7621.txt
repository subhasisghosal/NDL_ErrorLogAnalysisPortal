While the P2P bandwidth sharing design is very efficient for bandwidth-sensitive applications, it imposes a fundamental performance constraint for delay-sensitive applications: The uploading bandwidth of a peer cannot be utilized to upload a piece of content until it completes the download of that content. This constraint sets up a limit on how fast a piece of content can be disseminated to all peers in a P2P system. In this paper, we theoretically study the impact of this inherent delay constraint and derive the minimum delay bounds for P2P live streaming systems. We show that the bandwidth heterogeneity among peers can be exploited to significantly improve the delay performance of all peers. We further propose a conceptual snowball streaming algorithm to approach the minimum delay bound in a dynamic P2P networking environment. Our analysis and simulation suggest that the proposed algorithm has better delay performance and more robust than static balanced multi-tree-based streaming solutions. Insights brought forth by our study can be used to guide the design of new P2P systems with shorter streaming delays."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10051","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10051","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10051","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10052","fieldValue":" The problem of providing quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for multicast traffic over crossbar switches has received limited attention despite the popularity of its counterpart for unicast traffic. Providing a 100% throughput to all admissible multicast traffic has been shown to be a very difficult task, and it requires a very high speedup in the switching fabric. In this paper, we introduce the concept of rate quantization and use rate quantization to show an analogy between packet scheduling in crossbar switches and circuit switching in three-stage Clos networks. We exploit the analogy to adopt circuit-switching algorithms in wide-sense and strict-sense nonblocking Clos networks in order to construct nonblocking packet schedulers for unicast and multicast traffic. We illustrate a simple multicast nonblocking packet scheduler, for which a speedup of 6 log n\/log log n is sufficient to support 100% throughput for any admissible multicast traffic in an n x n crossbar switch. Moreover, we revisit some problems in unicast switch scheduling. We illustrate that the analogy provides useful perspectives, and we give a simple proof for a well-known result."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10052","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10052","fieldValue":"Rate quantization and the speedup required to achieve 100% throughput for multicast over crossbar switches"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10052","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10052","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10053","fieldValue":" In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding the layer-2 network topology of large, heterogeneous multisubnet Ethernet networks that may include uncooperative network nodes. We prove that finding a layer-2 network topology for a given incomplete input is an NP-hard problem, even for single subnet networks, and that deciding whether a given input defines a unique network topology is a co-NP-hard problem. We design several heuristic algorithms to find network topology, evaluate their complexity, and provide criteria for instances in which the input guarantees a unique network topology. We have implemented one of our algorithms and conducted extensive experiments on the Kent State University Computer Science network. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is quite practical and discovers the accurate network topology of multisubnet networks whose input may not necessarily be complete."}
