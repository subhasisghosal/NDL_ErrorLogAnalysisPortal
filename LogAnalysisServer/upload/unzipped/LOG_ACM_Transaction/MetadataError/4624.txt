{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24952","fieldValue":" We motivate and describe improved fast simulation techniques for the accelerated performance evaluation of highly available services. In systems that provide such services, service unavailability events are rare due to a low component failure rate or high resource capacity. Using traditional Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate such services requires a large amount of runtime. Importance sampling (IS) has been applied to certain instances of such systems, focusing on single-class and\/or homogeneous resource demands. In this article, we formulate highly available services as multiresource losstype systems, and we present two IS methods for fast simulation, extending to multiple classes and nonhomogeneous resource demands. First, for the cases in which component failure rates are small, we prove that static IS using the Standard Clock (S-ISSC) method exhibits the bounded relative error (BRE) property. Second, for estimating failure probabilities due to large capacity or fast service in systems that have nonrare component failure rates, we propose adaptive ISSC (A-ISSC), which estimates the relative probability of reaching each possible state of system failure in every step of the simulation. Using A-ISSC, IS methods which are proven to be efficient can be extended to multidimensional cases, while still retaining a very favorable performance, as supported by our validation experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24953","fieldValue":" In this article, we present three smoothed functional (SF) algorithms for simulation optimization. While one of these estimates only the gradient by using a finite difference approximation with two parallel simulations, the other two are adaptive Newton-based stochastic approximation algorithms that estimate both the gradient and Hessian. One of the Newton-based algorithms uses only one simulation and has a one-sided estimate in both the gradient and Hessian, while the other uses two-sided estimates in both quantities and requires two simulations. For obtaining gradient and Hessian estimates, we perturb each parameter component randomly using independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Gaussian random variates. The earlier SF algorithms in the literature only estimate the gradient of the objective function. Using similar techniques, we derive two unbiased SF-based estimators for the Hessian and develop suitable three-timescale stochastic approximation procedures for simulation optimization. We present a detailed convergence analysis of our algorithms and show numerical experiments with parameters of dimension 50 on a setting involving a network of M\/G\/1 queues with feedback. We compare the performance of our algorithms with related algorithms in the literature. While our two-simulation Newton-based algorithm shows the best results overall, our one-simulation algorithm shows better performance compared to other one-simulation algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24953","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24953","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24954","fieldValue":"Tebbens, Radboud J Duintjer"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24954","fieldValue":" Sensitivity analysis has become a natural step in the uncertainty analysis framework. As there is no general sensitivity measure that would capture all information on impact of input factors on model output, analysts tend to combine various measures to obtain a broader image of interactions between different modes. This article concentrates on the correlation ratio, demonstrates methods for calculating this quantity efficiently and accurately, and compares the results. A new method inspired by artificial intelligence techniques emerges as outperforming the familiar methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24954","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24954","fieldValue":"ACM"}
