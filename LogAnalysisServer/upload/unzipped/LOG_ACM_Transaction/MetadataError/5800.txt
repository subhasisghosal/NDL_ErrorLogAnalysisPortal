A few recent studies have developed identity-by-descent (IBD) based methods to reveal the signature of the relatively recent historical events. Notably, Pe&#x0027;er and his colleagues have introduced a novel method (named PIBD here) by employing IBD sharing to infer effective population size and migration rate. However, under island model, PIBD neglects the coalescent information before the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) which leads to apparent deviations in certain situations. In this paper, we propose a new method, MIBD, by adopting a Markov process to describe the island model and develop a new formula for estimating IBD sharing. The new formula considers the coalescent information before tMRCA and the joint effect of the coalescent and migration events. We apply both MIBD and PIBD to the genome-wide data of two human populations (Palestinian and Bedouin) obtained from the HGDP-CEPH database, and demonstrate that MIBD is competitive to PIBD. Our simulation analyses also show that the results of MIBD are more accurate than those of PIBD especially in the case of small effective population size."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5307","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5307","fieldValue":"A Probabilistic Method for Estimating the Sharing of Identity by Descent for Populations with Migration"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5308","fieldValue":" This paper presents an FPGA based DNA comparison platform which can be run concurrently with the sensing phase of DNA sequencing and shortens the overall time needed for de novo DNA assembly. A hybrid overlap searching algorithm is applied which is scalable and can deal with incremental detection of new bases. To handle the incomplete data set which gradually increases during sequencing time, all-against-all comparisons are broken down into successive window-against-window comparison phases and executed using a novel dynamic suffix comparison algorithm combined with a partitioned dynamic programming method. The complete system has been designed to facilitate parallel processing in hardware, which allows real-time comparison and full scalability as well as a decrease in the number of computations required. A base pair comparison rate of 51.2Â G\/s is achieved when implemented on an FPGA with successful DNA comparison when using data sets from real genomes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5308","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
