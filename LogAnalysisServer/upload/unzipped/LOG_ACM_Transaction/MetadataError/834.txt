{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13435","fieldValue":" Power gating is a widely used leakage power saving strategy in modern chip designs. However, power gating introduces unique power integrity issues and trade-offs between switching and rush current (wake-up) supply noises. At the same time, the amount of power saving intrinsically trades off with power integrity. In addition, these trade-offs significantly vary with supply voltage. In this article, we propose systemic decoupling capacitors (decaps) optimization strategies that optimally trade-off between power integrity and leakage saving. Specially, new global decap and reroutable decap design concepts are proposed to relax the tight interaction between power integrity and leakage saving of power gated PDNs with a single supply voltage level. Furthermore, we propose a flexible decap allocation technique to deal with the design trade-offs under multiple supply voltage levels. The proposed strategies are implemented in an automatic design flow for choosing the optimal amount of local decaps, global decaps and reroutable decaps. The conducted experiments demonstrate that leakage saving can be increased significantly compared with the conventional PDN design approach with a single supply voltage level using the proposed techniques without jeopardizing power integrity. For PDN designs operating at two supply voltage levels, the optimal performance is achieved at each voltage level."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13435","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13435","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2281","fieldValue":" We consider the k-traveling repairmen problem, also known as the minimum latency problem, to multiple repairmen. We give a polynomial-time 8.497α-approximation algorithm for this generalization, where α denotes the best achievable approximation factor for the problem of finding the least-cost rooted tree spanning i vertices of a metric. For the latter problem, a (2 &plus; &epsiv;)-approximation is known. Our results can be compared with the best-known approximation algorithm using similar techniques for the case k &equals; 1, which is 3.59α. Moreover, recent work of Chaudry et al. [2003] shows how to remove the factor of α, thus improving all of these results by that factor. We are aware of no previous work on the approximability of the present problem. In addition, we give a simple proof of the 3.59α-approximation result that can be more easily extended to the case of multiple repairmen, and may be of independent interest."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13436","fieldValue":"Tahoori, Mehdi B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13436","fieldValue":" Process together with runtime variations in temperature and voltage, as well as transistor aging, degrade path delay and may eventually induce circuit failure due to timing variations. Therefore, in-field tracking of path delays is essential, and to respond to this need, several delay sensor designs have been proposed in the literature. However, due to the significant overhead of these sensors and the large number of critical paths in today's IC, it is infeasible to monitor the delay of every critical path in silicon. We present an aging- and variationaware representative path selection technique based on machine learning that allows to measure the delay of a small set of paths and infer the delay of a larger pool of paths that are likely to fail due to delay variations. Simulation results for benchmark circuits highlight the accuracy of the proposed approach for predicting critical-path delay based on the selected representative paths."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13436","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13436","fieldValue":"ACM"}
