In this paper we introduce a novel heterogeneous transfer learning technique, Feature-Space Remapping (FSR), which transfers knowledge between domains with different feature spaces. This is accomplished without requiring typical feature-feature, feature instance, or instance-instance co-occurrence data. Instead we relate features in different feature-spaces through the construction of metafeatures. We show how these techniques can utilize multiple source datasets to construct an ensemble learner which further improves performance. We apply FSR to an activity recognition problem and a document classification problem. The ensemble technique is able to outperform all other baselines and even performs better than a classifier trained using a large amount of labeled data in the target domain. These problems are especially difficult because, in addition to having different feature-spaces, the marginal probability distributions and the class labels are also different. This work extends the state of the art in transfer learning by considering large transfer across dramatically different spaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7601","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7601","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7602","fieldValue":" A moving object cluster is a set of objects that move close to each other for a long time interval. Existing works have utilized object trajectories to discover moving object clusters efficiently. In this article, we define a spatiotemporal influence-based moving cluster that captures spatiotemporal influence spread over a set of spatial objects. A spatiotemporal influence-based moving cluster is a sequence of spatial clusters, where each cluster is a set of nearby objects, such that each object in a cluster influences at least one object in the next immediate cluster and is also influenced by an object from the immediate preceding cluster. Real-life examples of spatiotemporal influence-based moving clusters include diffusion of infectious diseases and spread of innovative ideas. We study the discovery of spatiotemporal influence-based moving clusters in a database of spatiotemporal events. While the search space for discovering all spatiotemporal influence-based moving clusters is prohibitively huge, we design a method, STIMer, to efficiently retrieve the maximal answer. The algorithm STIMer adopts a top-down recursive refinement method to generate the maximal spatiotemporal influence-based moving clusters directly. Empirical studies on the real data as well as large synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7602","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7602","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7603","fieldValue":"Sepehri-Rad, Hoda"}
