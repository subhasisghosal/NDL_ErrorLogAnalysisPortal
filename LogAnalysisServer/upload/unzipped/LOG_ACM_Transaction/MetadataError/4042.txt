Although the technique proves to be quite effective for authorship verification, with the best overall parameter settings yielding an equal error rate of 3&percnt; on a test corpus of student essays, the optimal parameters vary greatly depending on author and evaluation criterion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23030","fieldValue":" We present an unsupervised statistical method for automatic choice of near-synonyms when the context is given. The method uses the Web as a corpus to compute scores based on mutual information. Our evaluation experiments show that this method performs better than two previous methods on the same task. We also describe experiments in using supervised learning for this task. We present an application to an intelligent thesaurus. This work is also useful in machine translation and natural language generation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23031","fieldValue":" We present a model family called Morfessor for the unsupervised induction of a simple morphology from raw text data. The model is formulated in a probabilistic maximum a posteriori framework. Morfessor can handle highly inflecting and compounding languages where words can consist of lengthy sequences of morphemes. A lexicon of word segments, called morphs, is induced from the data. The lexicon stores information about both the usage and form of the morphs. Several instances of the model are evaluated quantitatively in a morpheme segmentation task on different sized sets of Finnish as well as English data. Morfessor is shown to perform very well compared to a widely known benchmark algorithm, in particular on Finnish data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23031","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23031","fieldValue":"ACM"}
