We base our puzzle pieces on the family of 2D shapes known as polyominoes in recreational mathematics, and construct the 3D puzzle model by covering its geometry with polyominolike shapes. We first apply quad-based surface parametrization to the input solid, and tile the parametrized surface with polyominoes. Then, we construct a nonintersecting offset surface inside the input solid and shape the puzzle pieces to fit inside a thick shell volume. Finally, we develop a family of associated techniques for precisely constructing the geometry of individual puzzle pieces, including the ring-based ordering scheme, the motion space analysis technique, and the tab and blank construction method. The final completed puzzle model is guaranteed to be not only buildable, but also interlocking and maintainable."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16196","fieldValue":"Adamo-Villani, Nicoletta"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16196","fieldValue":" A conventional pinhole camera captures only a small fraction of a 3-D scene due to occlusions. We introduce the graph camera, a non-pinhole with rays that circumvent occluders to create a single layer image that shows simultaneously several regions of interest in a 3-D scene. The graph camera image exhibits good continuity and little redundancy. The graph camera model is literally a graph of tens of planar pinhole cameras. A fast projection operation allows rendering in feed-forward fashion, at interactive rates, which provides support for dynamic scenes. The graph camera is an infrastructure level tool with many applications. We explore the graph camera benefits in the contexts of virtual 3-D scene exploration and summarization, and in the context of real-world 3-D scene visualization. The graph camera allows integrating multiple video feeds seamlessly, which enables monitoring complex real-world spaces with a single image."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16196","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16196","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16197","fieldValue":" We transform an LCD into a display that supports both 2D multi-touch and unencumbered 3D gestures. Our BiDirectional (BiDi) screen, capable of both image capture and display, is inspired by emerging LCDs that use embedded optical sensors to detect multiple points of contact. Our key contribution is to exploit the spatial light modulation capability of LCDs to allow lensless imaging without interfering with display functionality. We switch between a display mode showing traditional graphics and a capture mode in which the backlight is disabled and the LCD displays a pinhole array or an equivalent tiled-broadband code. A large-format image sensor is placed slightly behind the liquid crystal layer. Together, the image sensor and LCD form a mask-based light field camera, capturing an array of images equivalent to that produced by a camera array spanning the display surface. The recovered multi-view orthographic imagery is used to passively estimate the depth of scene points. Two motivating applications are described: a hybrid touch plus gesture interaction and a light-gun mode for interacting with external light-emitting widgets. We show a working prototype that simulates the image sensor with a camera and diffuser, allowing interaction up to 50 cm in front of a modified 20.1 inch LCD."}
