We show that an upper bound for the Îµ-dissemination time consists of the conductance bound for a network without switching, and an adjustment that accounts for the number of informed nodes in each period between topology changes. Through numerical simulations, we show that our bound is asymptotically tight.We apply our results to the case of mobile wireless networks with unreliable communication links and establish an upper bound for the dissemination time when the network undergoes topology changes and periods of communication link erasures."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10452","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10453","fieldValue":"Lee, Suk-Bok"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10453","fieldValue":" In this paper, we use real experiments to study multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) 802.11n rate adaptation (RA) on a programmable access point (AP) platform. Our case study shows that existing RA solutions offer much lower throughput than even a fixed-rate scheme. It is proven that all such algorithms are MIMO-mode oblivious; they do not differentiate spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing modes. We first design MiRA, a novel MIMO RA scheme that zigzags between intra- and inter-MIMO modes to addressMIMO 802.11n dynamics. Second, we examine a window-based RA solution, which runs an independent RA in each MIMO mode in parallel and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based MIMO RA that differentiates modes using SNR measurements. Our experiments show that MIMO-mode aware designs outperform MIMO-mode oblivious RAs in various settings, with goodput gains up to 73.5% in field trials."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10453","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10453","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10453","fieldValue":"ACM"}
