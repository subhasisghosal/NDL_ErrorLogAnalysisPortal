Pedigrees allow to infer haplotypes from genotypes more accurately than population data, since Mendelian inheritance restricts the set of possible solutions. In this work, we define a new HI problem on pedigrees, called Minimum-Change Haplotype Configuration (MCHC) problem, that allows two types of genetic variation events: recombinations and mutations. Our new formulation extends the Minimum-Recombinant Haplotype Configuration (MRHC) problem, that has been proposed in the literature to overcome the limitations of classic statistical haplotyping methods. Our contribution is twofold. First, we prove that the MCHC problem is APX-hard under several restrictions. Second, we propose an efficient and accurate heuristic algorithm for MCHC based on an L-reduction to a well-known coding problem. Our heuristic can also be used to solve the original MRHC problem and can take advantage of additional knowledge about the input genotypes. Moreover, the L-reduction proves for the first time that MCHC and MRHC are O({nm\\over \\log nm} -approximable on general pedigrees, where n is the pedigree size and m is the genotype length. Finally, we present an extensive experimental evaluation and comparison of our heuristic algorithm with several other state-of-the-art methods for HI on pedigrees."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4692","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4692","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4692","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4693","fieldValue":"Doyon, Jean-Philippe"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4693","fieldValue":" Background. Inferring an evolutionary scenario for a gene family is a fundamental problem with applications both in functional and evolutionary genomics. The gene tree\/species tree reconciliation approach has been widely used to address this problem, but mostly in a discrete parsimony framework that aims at minimizing the number of gene duplications and\/or gene losses. Recently, a probabilistic approach has been developed, based on the classical birth-and-death process, including efficient algorithms for computing posterior probabilities of reconciliations and orthology prediction. Results. In previous work, we described an algorithm for exploring the whole space of gene tree\/species tree reconciliations, that we adapt here to compute efficiently the posterior probability of such reconciliations. These posterior probabilities can be either computed exactly or approximated, depending on the reconciliation space size. We use this algorithm to analyze the probabilistic landscape of the space of reconciliations for a real data set of fungal gene families and several data sets of synthetic gene trees. Conclusion. The results of our simulations suggest that, with exact gene trees obtained by a simple birth-and-death process and realistic gene duplication\/loss rates, a very small subset of all reconciliations needs to be explored in order to approximate very closely the posterior probability of the most likely reconciliations. For cases where the posterior probability mass is more evenly dispersed, our method allows to explore efficiently the required subspace of reconciliations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4693","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4693","fieldValue":"An Efficient Method for Exploring the Space of Gene Tree\/Species Tree Reconciliations in a Probabilistic Framework"}
