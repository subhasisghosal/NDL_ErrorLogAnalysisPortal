Data-race-free (DRF) models, such as the C++11 memory model, guarantee SC execution for data-race-free programs. But these models provide no guarantee at all for racy programs, compromising the safety and debuggability of such programs. To address the safety issue, the Java memory model, which is also based on the DRF model, provides a weak semantics for racy executions. However, this semantics is subtle and complex, making it difficult for programmers to reason about their programs and for compiler writers to ensure the correctness of compiler optimizations. We present the drfx memory model, which is simple for programmers to understand and use while still supporting many common optimizations. We introduce a memory model (MM) exception that can be signaled to halt execution. If a program executes without throwing this exception, then drfx guarantees that the execution is SC. If a program throws an MM exception during an execution, then drfx guarantees that the program has a data race. We observe that SC violations can be detected in hardware through a lightweight form of conflict detection. Furthermore, our model safely allows aggressive compiler and hardware optimizations within compiler-designated program regions. We formalize our memory model, prove several properties of this model, describe a compiler and hardware design suitable for drfx, and evaluate the performance overhead due to our compiler and hardware requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20823","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20823","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/20824","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"19\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20825\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security (TOPS) : Volume 19\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/20825","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"December 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20829\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, December 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"December 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20828\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, December 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"September 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20827\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, September 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"August 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20826\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, August 2016\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20830","fieldValue":" We introduce a novel biometric based on distinctive eye movement patterns. The biometric consists of 20 features that allow us to reliably distinguish users based on differences in these patterns. We leverage this distinguishing power along with the ability to gauge the usersâ\u20AC™ task familiarity, that is, level of knowledge, to address insider threats. In a controlled experiment, we test how both time and task familiarity influence eye movements and feature stability, and how different subsets of features affect the classifier performance. These feature subsets can be used to tailor the eye movement biometric to different authentication methods and threat models. Our results show that eye movement biometrics support reliable and stable continuous authentication of users. We investigate different approaches in which an attacker could attempt to use inside knowledge to mimic the legitimate user. Our results show that while this advance knowledge is measurable, it does not increase the likelihood of successful impersonation. In order to determine the time stability of our features, we repeat the experiment twice within 2 weeks. The results indicate that we can reliably authenticate users over the entire period. We show that lower sampling rates provided by low-cost hardware pose a challenge, but that reliable authentication is possible even at the rate of 50Hz commonly available with consumer-level devices. In a second set of experiments, we evaluate how our authentication system performs across a variety of real-world tasks, including reading, writing, and web browsing. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our approach in detail and give practical insights on the use of this biometric in a real-world environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20830","fieldValue":"ACM"}
