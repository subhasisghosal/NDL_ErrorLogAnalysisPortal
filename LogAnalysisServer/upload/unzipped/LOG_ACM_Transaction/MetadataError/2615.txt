Specifically, solutions are found in two dimensions for the nonseparable self-adjoint elliptic problem &xdtri;&dot;g&xdtri;y =f , where g and f are given functions of x and y, in two-dimensional polygonal domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Helmholtz and Poisson problems in polygonal domains and the general variable coefficient problem i.e.,gâ\u2030 1 in a rectangular domain may be treated as special cases. The method of solution combines the use of the capacitance matrix method, to treat the irregular boundary, with an efficient iterative method (using the Laplacian as preconditioner) to deal 2 with nonseparability. Each iterative step thus involves solving the Poisson equation in a rectangular domain. The package includes separate, easy-to-use routines for the Helmholtz problem and the general problem in rectangular and general polygonal domains, and example driver routines for each. Both single- and double-precision routines are provided.Second-order-accurate finite differencing is employed. Storage requirements increase approximately as p2 + n2, where p is the number of irregular boundary points and where n is the linear domain dimension. The preprocessing time (the capacitance matrix calculation) varies as pn2 log n, and the solution time varies as n2 log n. If the equations are to be solved repeatedly in the same geometry, but with different source or diffusion functions, the capacitance matrix need only be calculated once, and hence the algorithm is particularly efficient for such cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18793","fieldValue":" A great number of analysis and synthesis problems of modern processes can be written as state and control constrained optimal control problems governed by ordinary differential equations with multipoint boundary values. As the software tools for following this attractive approach are still missing or can be used only by experts, the structure and usage of an easy-to-use software package is described which efficiently solves the given problem. Among its features are user-orientation, applicability on personal computers and mainframes, and robustness with respect to model changes and inaccurate starting values. It has been tested on a number of complex engineering tasks, including aerospace and robotic trajectory planning."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18793","fieldValue":"ACM"}
