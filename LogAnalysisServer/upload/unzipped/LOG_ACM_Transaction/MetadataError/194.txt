While running within the theoretically established complexity upper bound, we believe that our tableaux are practically more efficient in the average case than other decision procedures for ATL known so far. Besides, the ease of its adaptation to variants of ATL demonstrates the flexibility of the proposed procedure."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11566","fieldValue":" We consider regular languages of labeled trees. We give an effective characterization of the regular languages over such trees that are definable in first-order logic in the language of labeled graphs. These languages are the analog on trees of the \u20AClocally threshold testable\u20AC? languages on strings. We show that this characterization yields a decision procedure for determining whether a regular tree language is first-order definable: The procedure is polynomial time in the minimal automaton presenting the regular language. We also provide an algorithm for deciding whether a regular language is definable in first-order logic supplemented with modular quantifiers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11566","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11566","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11567","fieldValue":" The formal system 位\u201D is a typed 位-calculus that pursues the unification of terms, types, environments, and contexts as the main goal. 位\u201D takes some features from the Automath-related 位-calculi and some from the pure type systems, but differs from both in that it does not include the  construction while it provides for an abbreviation mechanism at the level of terms. 位\u201D enjoys some important desirable properties such as the confluence of reduction, the correctness of types, the uniqueness of types up to conversion, the subject reduction of the type assignment, the strong normalization of the typed terms, and, as a corollary, the decidability of type inference problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11567","fieldValue":"ACM"}
