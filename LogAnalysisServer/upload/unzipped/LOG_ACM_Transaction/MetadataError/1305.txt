A bounding function in this context is an upper or lower estimate on the extent of the constituent sets; such bounds are commonly used to speed up algorithms based on such trees. We introduce the class of totally consistent bounding functions, which have the desirable properties of allowing surprisingly good bounds to be built quickly. Both outer and inner bounds can be refined using a set of rewrite rules, for which we give some complexity and convergence results. We have implemented the refinement rules for outer bounds within a solid modeling system, where they have proved especially useful for intersection testing in three and four dimensions. Our implementations have used boxes as bounds, but different classes (shapes) of bounds are also explored. The rewrite rules are also applicable to relatively slow, exact operations, which we explore for their theoretical insight, and to general Boolean algebras. Results concerning the relationship between these bounds and active zones are also noted."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15059","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15059","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15060","fieldValue":" In this paper we study the relationship between manifold solids (r-sets whose boundaries are two-dimensional closed manifolds) and r-sets. We begin by showing that an r-set may be viewed as the limit of a certain sequence of manifold solids, where distance is measured using the Hausdorff metric. This permits us to introduce a minimal set of generalized Euler operators, sufficient for the construction and manipulation of r-sets. The completeness result for ordinary Euler operators carries over immediately to the generalized Euler operators on the r-sets and the modification of the usual boundary data structures, corresponding to our extension to nonmanifold r-sets, is straightforward. We in fact describe a modification of a well-known boundary data structure in order to illustrate how the extension can be used in typical solid modeling algorithms, and describe an implementation.The results described above largely eliminate what has been called an inherent mismatch between the modeling spaces defined by manifold solids and by r-sets. We view the r-sets as a more appropriate choice for a modeling space: in particular, the r-sets provide closure with respect to regularized set operations and a complete set of generalized Euler operators for the manipulation of boundary representations, for graphics and other purposes. It remains to formulate and prove a theorem on the soundness of the generalized Euler operators."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15060","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15060","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15061","fieldValue":" This paper presents an efficient algorithm called Hermite interpolation, for constructing low-degree algebraic surfaces, which contain, with C1 or tangent plane continuity, any given collection of points and algebraic space curves having derivative information. Positional as well as derivative constraints on an implicitly defined algebraic surface are translated into a homogeneous linear system, where the unknowns are the coefficients of the polynomial defining the algebraic surface. Computaional details of the Hermite interpolation algorithm are presented along with several illustrative applications of the interpolation technique to construction of joining or blending surfaces for solid models as well as fleshing surfaces for curved wire frame models. A heuristic approach to interactive shape control of implicit algebraic surfaces is also given, and open problems in algebraic surface design are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15061","fieldValue":"ACM"}
