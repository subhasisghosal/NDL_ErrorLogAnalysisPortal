{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13362","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a new performance bound analysis of analog circuits considering process variations. We model the variations of component values as intervals measured from tested chips and manufacture processes. The new method first applies a graph-based analysis approach to generate the symbolic transfer function of a linear(ized) analog circuit. Then the frequency response bounds (maximum and minimum) are obtained by performing nonlinear constrained optimization in which magnitude or phase of the transfer function is the objective function to be optimized subject to the ranges of process variational parameters. The response bounds given by the optimization-based method are very accurate and do not have the over-conservativeness issues of existing methods. Based on the frequency-domain bounds, we further develop a method to calculate the time-domain response bounds for any arbitrary input stimulus. Experimental results from several analog benchmark circuits show that the proposed method gives the correct bounds verified by Monte Carlo analysis while it delivers one order of magnitude speedup over Monte Carlo for both frequency-domain and time-domain bound analyses. We also show analog circuit yield analysis as an application of the frequency-domain variational bound analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13362","fieldValue":"Performance bound analysis of analog circuits in frequency- and time-domain considering process variations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13363","fieldValue":"Huang, Chien-Chih"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13363","fieldValue":"Wey, Chin-Long"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13363","fieldValue":"Chen, Jwu-E"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13363","fieldValue":"Luo, Pei-Wen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13363","fieldValue":" Yield is defined as the probability that the circuit under consideration meets with the design specification within the tolerance. Placement with higher correlation coefficients has fewer mismatches and lower variation of capacitor ratio, thus achieving higher yield performance. This study presents a new optimization criterion that quickly determines if the placement is optimal. The optimization criterion leads to the development of the concepts of C-entries and partitioned subarrays which can significantly reduce the searching space for finding the optimal\/near-optimal placements on a sufficiently large array size."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13363","fieldValue":"Optimal common-centroid-based unit capacitor placements for yield enhancement of switched-capacitor circuits"}
