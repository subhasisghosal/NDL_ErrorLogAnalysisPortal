To construct our new estimator, we first generate a sample path of a fixed number of cycles based on one sequence of regeneration times, divide the path into segments based on the second sequence of regeneration times, permute the segments, and calculate the performance on the new path using the first sequence of regeneration times. We average over all possible permutations to construct the new estimator. This strictly reduces variance when the original estimator is not simply an additive functional of the sample path. To use the new estimator in practice, the extra computational effort is not large since all permutations do not actually have to be computed as we derive explicit formulas for our new estimators. We examine the small-sample behavior of our estimators. In particular, we prove that for any fixed number of cycles from the first regenerative sequence, our new estimator has smaller mean squared error than the standard estimator. We show explicitly that our method can be used to derive new estimators for the expected cumulative reward until a certain set of states is hit and the time-average variance parameter of a regenerative simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24792","fieldValue":" A new analysis method for continuous time Markov chains is introduced. The method combines, in some sense, simulation and numerical techniques for the analysis of large Markov chains. The basis of the new method is the description of a continuous-time Markov chain as a set of communicating processes. The state of all or some of the processes is described by a state vector, including a probability distribution over the set of locally reachable states. Simulation is used to determine the event times and message types exchanged between processes. Local transitions are realized by vector matrix products describing the next state distribution form the current one. In this way, the state explosion problem of numerical analysis is avoided, but it is still possible to obtain more accurate results that with pure simulation. The approach is therefore especially useful for the analysis of quantities with small probabilities or for the analysis of rare events."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24792","fieldValue":"A new approach combining simulation and randomization for the analysis of large continuous time Markov chains"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24793","fieldValue":"Chen, Wu-Lin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24793","fieldValue":"OCinneide, Colm Art"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24793","fieldValue":" We present a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for class throughputs in closed multiclass product-form networks. The method is as follows. For a given network, we construct a â\u20ACœregularizedâ\u20AC? network with a highly simplified structure that has the same steady-state distribution. We then simulate the regularized network. The method has performed reasonably well across a broad range of problems. We give a heuristic explanation of this and prove that the regularized network â\u20ACœmixes in polynomial timeâ\u20AC? in some special cases."}
