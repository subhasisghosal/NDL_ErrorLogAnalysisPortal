{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23073","fieldValue":" The process of identifying the actual meanings of words in a given text fragment has a long history in the field of computational linguistics. Due to its importance in understanding the semantics of natural language, it is considered one of the most challenging problems facing this field. In this article we propose a new unsupervised similarity-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm that operates by computing the semantic similarity between glosses of the target word and a context vector. The sense of the target word is determined as that for which the similarity between gloss and context vector is greatest. Thus, whereas conventional unsupervised WSD methods are based on measuring pairwise similarity between words, our approach is based on measuring semantic similarity between sentences. This enables it to utilize a higher degree of semantic information, and is more consistent with the way that human beings disambiguate; that is, by considering the greater context in which the word appears. We also show how performance can be further improved by incorporating a preliminary step in which the relative importance of words within the original text fragment is estimated, thereby providing an ordering that can be used to determine the sequence in which words should be disambiguated. We provide empirical results that show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art unsupervised word sense disambiguation methods, as evaluated on several benchmark datasets through different models of evaluation."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23073","fieldValue":"Unsupervised similarity-based word sense disambiguation using context vectors and sentential word importance"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23073","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23073","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23074","fieldValue":"Bouayad-Agha, Nadjet"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23074","fieldValue":" Team sports commentaries call for techniques that are able to select content and generate wordings to reflect the affinity of the targeted reader for one of the teams. The existing works tend to have in common that they either start from knowledge sources of limited size to whose structures then different ways of realization are explicitly assigned, or they work directly with linguistic corpora, without the use of a deep knowledge source. With the increasing availability of large-scale ontologies this is no longer satisfactory: techniques are needed that are applicable to general purpose ontologies, but which still take user preferences into account. We take the best of both worlds in that we use a two-layer ontology. The first layer is composed of raw domain data modelled in an application-independent base OWL ontology. The second layer contains a rich perspective generation-motivated domain communication knowledge ontology, inferred from the base ontology. The two-layer ontology allows us to take into account user perspective-oriented criteria at different stages of generation to generate perspective-oriented commentaries. We show how content selection, discourse structuring, information structure determination, and lexicalization are driven by these criteria and how stage after stage a truly user perspective-tailored summary is generated. The viability of our proposal has been evaluated for the generation of football match summaries of the First Spanish Football League. The reported outcome of the evaluation demonstrates that we are on the right track."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23074","fieldValue":"OWL"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23074","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23074","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3253","fieldValue":"McNamara, Caolan"}
