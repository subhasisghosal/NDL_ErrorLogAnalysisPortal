However, the scan based logic BIST approach being widely considered for this application suffers from two significant weaknesses: slow test-per-scan execution, and a limited capability for detecting realistic timing and delay faults, critical in deep submicron technologies. The new multimode scan based approach presented here supports test-per-clock BIST, which runs orders of magnitude faster, and also provides significantly better delay fault coverage."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12878","fieldValue":"BIST"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12878","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12878","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12879","fieldValue":" This article presents a methodology for testing high-performance pipelined circuits with slow-speed testers. The technique uses a clock timing circuit to control data transfer in the pipeline in test mode. The technique adds no extra hardware in the data path of the pipeline and therefore has virtually no performance penalty. A clock timing circuit capable of achieving a timing resolution of 50 ps in 0.18 Î¼m CMOS technology is presented. The design provides the ability to test the clock timing circuit itself. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated using a 16-bit pipelined multiplier as a test vehicle. Simulations show that we are able to detect delay faults as small as 50 ps at an input clock frequency of 100 MHz."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12879","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12879","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12880","fieldValue":" A new approach for testing mixed-signal circuits based upon using imprecise stimuli is introduced. Unlike most existing Built-In Self-Test (BIST) and production test approaches that require excitation signals that are at least 3 bits or more linear than the Device-Under-Test (DUT), the proposed approach can work with stimuli that are several bits less linear than the DUT. This dramatically reduces the requirements on stimulus generation for BIST applications and offers potential for using inexpensive signal generators in production test, or for testing DUTs that have a linearity performance exceeding that of the available test equipment. As a proof of concept, a histogram-based algorithm for linearity testing for Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) has been proposed. It can estimate the Integral Nonlinearity (INL) and Differential Nonlinearity (DNL) of an n-bit ADC by using a ramp signal of much less than n-bit linearity and a shifted version of the same nonlinear ramp as excitation. The performance of the algorithm is comparable to that of the traditional method which uses (n + 3)-bits or a decade more linear input signals. Complete algorithm description, extensive simulation results and experimental results obtained from using a production tester on commercially available ICs are presented to validate the potential of this algorithm."}
