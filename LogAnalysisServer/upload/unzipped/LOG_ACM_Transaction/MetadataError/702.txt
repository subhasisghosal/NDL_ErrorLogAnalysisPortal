{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13148","fieldValue":" Rectilinear Steiner trees are used to route signal nets by global and detail routers in VLSI design for a long time. However, in current IC industry, there are significantly increasing obstacles to be considered, such as large-scale power networks, pre-routed nets, IP blocks, and antenna jumpers. Accordingly, the obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimal tree (OARSMT) problem has become more important. In this article, we propose a new routing graph, obstacle-avoiding routing graph (OARG), for the OARSMT problem. Due to the important properties of OARG, we construct a 3-step algorithm and a local refinement scheme, which both can take advantage of these properties, to find a suboptimal solution efficiently. Furthermore, each step of our 3-step algorithm as well as the local refinement scheme has theoretical or practical benefits. Therefore, each of them can be applicable to other existing works for general or specific considerations such as efficiency or effectiveness. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms all existing works in terms of wirelength and achieves the best speed performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13148","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13148","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13149","fieldValue":"Wong, Martin D F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13149","fieldValue":" Previous works on PCB bus routing assume matched pin ordering on both sides. But in practice, the pin ordering might be mismatched and the nets become twisted. In this article, we propose a preprocessing step to untangle such twisted nets. We also introduce a practical routing style, which we call single-detour routing, to simplify the untangling problem. We then present a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of single-detour routing solutions. Furthermore, we present a dynamic-programming-based algorithm to solve the single-detour untangling problem with consideration of wire capacity between adjacent pins. Our algorithm produces an optimal single-detour routing solution that rematches the pin ordering. By integrating our algorithm into the bus router in a previous length-matching router, we show that many routing problems that cannot be solved previously can now be solved with insignificant increase in runtime."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13149","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13149","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2252","fieldValue":" A variable can be multiplied by a given set of fixed-point constants using a multiplier block that consists exclusively of additions, subtractions, and shifts. The generation of a multiplier block from the set of constants is known as the multiple constant multiplication (MCM) problem. Finding the optimal solution, namely, the one with the fewest number of additions and subtractions, is known to be NP-complete. We propose a new algorithm for the MCM problem, which produces solutions that require up to 20&percnt; less additions and subtractions than the best previously known algorithm. At the same time our algorithm, in contrast to the closest competing algorithm, is not limited by the constant bitwidths. We present our algorithm using a unifying formal framework for the best, graph-based MCM algorithms and provide a detailed runtime analysis and experimental evaluation. We show that our algorithm can handle problem sizes as large as 100 32-bit constants in a time acceptable for most applications. The implementation of the new algorithm is available at www.spiral.net."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2252","fieldValue":"ACM"}
