This paper investigates the effect of noise-level variability on i-vectors. It demonstrates that noise-level variability causes the i-vectors to shift, causing the noise contaminated i-vectors to form clusters in the i-vector space. It also demonstrates that optimal subspaces for discriminating speakers are noise-level dependent. Based on these observations, this paper proposes using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of utterances as guidance for training mixture of PLDA models. To maximize the coordination among the PLDA models, mixtures of PLDA models are trained simultaneously via an EM algorithm using the utterances contaminated with noise at various levels. For scoring, given a test i-vector, the marginal likelihoods from individual PLDA models are linearly combined by the posterior probabilities of the test utterance's SNR. Verification scores are the ratio of the marginal likelihoods. Results based on NIST 2012 SRE suggest that the SNR-dependent mixture of PLDA is not only suitable for the situations where the test utterances exhibit a wide range of SNR, but also beneficial for the test utterances with unknown SNR distribution.

An approximate spatial correlation function solution for a radial Gaussian source location distribution is derived and compared with the existing numerical methods. An exact solution for a uniform volume source location distribution is also derived and compared with existing numerical methods. The approximate radial Gaussian solution produces a result consistent with numerical methods for compact source location distributions. The uniform volume solution matches the expected behavior. Finally, the spatial correlation functions were used to design spatially robust beamformers for compact microphone arrays. Both of the spatial correlation function solutions lead to improved spatial robustness for the applications of signal enhancement and suppression."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3971","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3971","fieldValue":"ACM"}
