We calculate analytically the number of collisions when the number of users in each cell is known. We then calculate the QoS indicators (e.g., blocking rates, download time and bit error rates) taking into account the physical layer conditions (modulation, propagation and MIMO), the MAC layer techniques (HARQ and radio resource management algorithms) and the traffic characteristics, in a cross-layer approach. We finally evaluate the impact of using adaptive modulation and coding on the overall performance of the system. This analysis allows us to calculate the Erlang capacity of a WiMAX system. Our numerical applications then show how to choose the best admission control and modulation schemes that extend the Erlang capacity region."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9809","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9809","fieldValue":"OFDMA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9810","fieldValue":" The load-balanced Birkhoff-von Neumann switching architecture consists of two stages: a load balancer and a deterministic input-queued crossbar switch. The advantages of this architecture are its simplicity and scalability, while its main drawback is the possible out-of-sequence reception of packets belonging to the same flow. Several solutions have been proposed to overcome this problem; among the most promising are the Uniform Frame Spreading (UFS) and the Full Ordered Frames First (FOFF) algorithms. In this paper, we present a new algorithm called Padded Frames (PF), which eliminates the packet reordering problem, achieves 100% throughput, and improves the delay performance of previously known algorithms."}
