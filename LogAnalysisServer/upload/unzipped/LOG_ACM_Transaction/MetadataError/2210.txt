Cutting-edge hair modeling techniques typically rely on expensive capture devices and significant manual labor. We introduce a novel data-driven framework that can digitize complete and highly complex 3D hairstyles from a single-view photograph. We first construct a large database of manually crafted hair models from several online repositories. Given a reference photo of the target hairstyle and a few user strokes as guidance, we automatically search for multiple best matching examples from the database and combine them consistently into a single hairstyle to form the large-scale structure of the hair model. We then synthesize the final hair strands by jointly optimizing for the projected 2D similarity to the reference photo, the physical plausibility of each strand, as well as the local orientation coherency between neighboring strands. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method on a variety of hairstyles and challenging images, and compare our system with state-of-the-art hair modeling algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17374","fieldValue":"De Paoli, Chris"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17374","fieldValue":" SecondSkin is a sketch-based modeling system focused on the creation of structures comprised of layered, shape interdependent 3D volumes. Our approach is built on three novel insights gleaned from an analysis of representative artist sketches. First, we observe that a closed loop of strokes typically define surface patches that bound volumes in conjunction with underlying surfaces. Second, a significant majority of these strokes map to a small set of curve-types, that describe the 3D geometric relationship between the stroke and underlying layer geometry. Third, we find that a few simple geometric features allow us to consistently classify 2D strokes to our proposed set of 3D curve-types. Our algorithm thus processes strokes as they are drawn, identifies their curve-type, and interprets them as 3D curves on and around underlying 3D geometry, using other connected 3D curves for context. Curve loops are automatically surfaced and turned into volumes bound to the underlying layer, creating additional curves and surfaces as necessary. Stroke classification by 15 viewers on a suite of ground truth sketches validates our curve-types and classification algorithm. We evaluate SecondSkin via a compelling gallery of layered 3D models that would be tedious to produce using current sketch modelers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17375","fieldValue":"Li, Chang-Jian"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17375","fieldValue":" We propose a new approach for automatic surfacing of 3D curve networks, a long standing computer graphics problem which has garnered new attention with the emergence of sketch based modeling systems capable of producing such networks. Our approach is motivated by recent studies suggesting that artist-designed curve networks consist of descriptive curves that convey intrinsic shape properties, and are dominated by representative flow lines designed to convey the principal curvature lines on the surface. Studies indicate that viewers complete the intended surface shape by envisioning a surface whose curvature lines smoothly blend these flow-line curves. Following these observations we design a surfacing framework that automatically aligns the curvature lines of the constructed surface with the representative flow lines and smoothly interpolates these representative flow, or curvature directions while minimizing undesired curvature variation. Starting with an initial triangle mesh of the network, we dynamically adapt the mesh to maximize the agreement between the principal curvature direction field on the surface and a smooth flow field suggested by the representative flow-line curves. Our main technical contribution is a framework for curvature-based surface modeling, that facilitates the creation of surfaces with prescribed curvature characteristics. We validate our method via visual inspection, via comparison to artist created and ground truth surfaces, as well as comparison to prior art, and confirm that our results are well aligned with the computed flow fields and with viewer perception of the input networks."}
