The core problem we address is efficient integration of the subspace force density over the 3D spatial domain. Similar to Gaussian quadrature schemes that efficiently integrate functions that lie in particular polynomial subspaces, we propose cubature schemes (multi-dimensional quadrature) optimized for efficient integration of force densities associated with particular subspace deformations, particular materials, and particular geometric domains. We support generic subspace deformation kinematics, and nonlinear hyperelastic materials. For an r-dimensional deformation subspace with O(r) cubature points, our method is able to evaluate sub-space forces at $O(r^2$) cost. We also describe composite cubature rules for runtime error estimation. Results are provided for various subspace deformation models, several hyperelastic materials (St.Venant-Kirchhoff, Mooney-Rivlin, Arruda-Boyce), and multi-modal (graphics, haptics, sound) applications. We show dramatically better efficiency than traditional Monte Carlo integration."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16034","fieldValue":" We present a novel technique for the animation of turbulent fluids by coupling a procedural turbulence model with a numerical fluid solver to introduce subgrid-scale flow detail. From the large-scale flow simulated by the solver, we model the production and behavior of turbulent energy using a physically motivated energy model. This energy distribution is used to synthesize an incompressible turbulent velocity field, whose features show plausible temporal behavior through a novel Lagrangian approach for advected noise. The synthesized turbulent flow has a dynamical effect on the large-scale flow, and produces visually plausible detailed features on both gaseous and free-surface liquid flows. Our method is an order of magnitude faster than full numerical simulation of equivalent resolution, and requires no manual direction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16034","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16034","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16035","fieldValue":" We present an efficient O(n) numerical algorithm for first-order approximation of geodesic distances on geometry images, where n is the number of points on the surface.
