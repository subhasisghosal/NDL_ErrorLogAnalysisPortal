This problem subsumes many interesting personalized web applications such as personalization for buzz query detection, for query expansion, and for query recommendation. These personalized applications can greatly enhance user interaction with web search engines by providing more customized information discovered from user input (i.e., queries), but the LQP task has rarely been investigated in the literature. Although exist abundant work on estimating global web search trends does exist, it often encounters the big challenge of data sparsity when personalization comes into play. In this article, we tackle the LQP task by proposing a series of collaborative language models (CLMs). CLMs alleviate the data sparsity issue by collaboratively collecting queries and trend information from the other locations. The traditional statistical language models assume a fixed background language model, which loses the taste of personalization. In contrast, CLMs are personalized language models with flexible background language models customized to various locations. The most sophisticated CLM enables the collaboration to adapt to specific query topics, which further advances the personalization level. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted on a large-scale web query log to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7191","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7191","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1656","fieldValue":" Speculative parallelization is a technique that allows code sections that cannot be fully analyzed by the compiler to be aggressively executed in parallel. However, while speculative parallelization can potentially deliver significant speedups, several overheads associated with this technique can limit these speedups in practice. This paper proposes a novel compiler static cost model of speculative multithreaded execution that can be used to predict the resulting performance. This model attempts to predict the expected speedups, or slowdowns, of the candidate speculative sections based on the estimation of the combined runtime effects of various overheads, and taking into account the scheduling restrictions of most speculative execution environments. The model is based on estimating the likely execution duration of threads and considers all the possible permutations of these threads. This model also produces a quantitative estimate of the speedup, which is different from prior heuristics that only qualitatively estimate the benefits of speculative multithreaded execution. In previous work, a limited version of the framework was evaluated on a number of loops from a collection of SPEC benchmarks that suffer mainly from load imbalance and thread dispatch and commit overheads. In this work, an extended framework is also evaluated on loops that may suffer from data-dependence violations. Experimental results show that prediction accuracy is lower when loops with violations are included. Nevertheless, accuracy is still very high for a static model: the framework can identify, on average, 45&percnt; of the loops that cause slowdowns and, on average, 96&percnt; of the loops that lead to speedups; it predicts the speedups or slowdowns with an error of less than 20&percnt; for an average of 28&percnt; of the loops across the benchmarks and with an error of less than 50&percnt; for an average of 80&percnt; of the loops. Overall, the framework often outperforms, by as much as 25&percnt;, a naive approach that attempts to speculatively parallelize all the loops considered, and is able to curb the large slowdowns caused in many cases by this naive approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1656","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1656","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7192","fieldValue":"Mcowan, Peter W"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7192","fieldValue":" Social perception abilities are among the most important skills necessary for robots to engage humans in natural forms of interaction. Affect-sensitive robots are more likely to be able to establish and maintain believable interactions over extended periods of time. Nevertheless, the integration of affect recognition frameworks in real-time human-robot interaction scenarios is still underexplored. In this article, we propose and evaluate a context-sensitive affect recognition framework for a robotic game companion for children. The robot can automatically detect affective states experienced by children in an interactive chess game scenario. The affect recognition framework is based on the automatic extraction of task features and social interaction-based features. Vision-based indicators of the childrenâ\u20AC™s nonverbal behaviour are merged with contextual features related to the game and the interaction and given as input to support vector machines to create a context-sensitive multimodal system for affect recognition. The affect recognition framework is fully integrated in an architecture for adaptive human-robot interaction. Experimental evaluation showed that childrenâ\u20AC™s affect can be successfully predicted using a combination of behavioural and contextual data related to the game and the interaction with the robot. It was found that contextual data alone can be used to successfully predict a subset of affective dimensions, such as interest toward the robot. Experiments also showed that engagement with the robot can be predicted using information about the userâ\u20AC™s valence, interest and anticipatory behaviour. These results provide evidence that social engagement can be modelled as a state consisting of affect and attention components in the context of the interaction."}
