In such a network, when there is no wavelength conversion, a connection is constrained to be on the same wavelength channel along its route. Alternate routing can improve the blocking performance of such a network by providing multiple possible paths between node pairs. Wavelength conversion can also improve the blocking performance of such a network by allowing a connection to use different wavelengths along its route. This work proposes an approximate analytical model that incorporates alternate routing and sparse wavelength conversion. We perform simulation studies of the relationships between alternate routing and wavelength conversion on three representative network topologies. We demonstrate that alternate routing generally provides significant benefits, and that it is important to design alternate routes between node pairs in an optimized fashion to exploit the connectivity of the network topology. The empirical results also indicate that fixed-alternate routing with a small number of alternate routes asymptotically approaches adaptive routing in blocking performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9099","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9099","fieldValue":"WDM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9099","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9100","fieldValue":" Buffer management schemes are needed in shared-memory packet switches to regulate the sharing of memory among different output port queues and among traffic classes with different loss priorities. Earlier we proposed a single-priority scheme called Dynamic Threshold (DT), in which the maximum permissible queue length is proportional to the unused buffering in the switch. A queue whose length equals or exceeds the current threshold value may accept no new arrivals. In this paper, we propose, analyze, and simulate several ways of incorporating loss priorities into the DT scheme. The analysis models sources as deterministic fluids. We determine how each scheme allocates buffers among the competing ports and loss priority classes under overload conditions. We also note how this buffer allocation induces an allocation of bandwidth among the loss priority classes at each port. We find that minor variations in the DT control law can produce dramatically different resource allocations. Based on this study, we recommend the scheme we call OWA, which gives some buffers and bandwidth to every priority class at every port. Scheme OWA has tunable parameters, which we give rules of thumb for setting. Another scheme, called AWA, is also a good choice. It has an allocation philosophy more akin to strict priority and hence is not tunable."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9100","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9100","fieldValue":"ACM"}
