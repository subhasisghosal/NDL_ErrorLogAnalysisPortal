To detect the location of a mobile sensor, the system relies on RF-characteristics of the signal transmitted by the mobile sensor, as it is received by stationary sensors (clusterheads). Location detection is posed as a hypothesis testing problem over a discretized space. Large deviations results enable the characterization of the probability of error leading to a placement problem that maximizes an information-theoretic distance (Chernoff distance) among all pairs of probability distributions of observations conditional on the sensor locations. The placement problem is shown to be NP-hard and is formulated as a linear integer programming problem; yet, large instances can be solved efficiently by leveraging special-purpose algorithms from the theory of discrete facility location. The resultant optimal placement is shown to provide asymptotic guarantees on the probability of error in location detection under quite general conditions by minimizing an upper bound of the error-exponent. Numerical results show that the proposed framework is computationally feasible and the resultant clusterhead placement performs near-optimal even with a small number of observation samples in a simulation environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9477","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9477","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9478","fieldValue":" A single commodity network that models the information flow in an arbitrary topology sensor field that collects and forwards information to a backbone through certain designated gateway nodes is considered. Resilient operation in overload stress situations caused by unpredictable traffic or topology variations is investigated. That amounts to studying the network in instability mode, where the traffic load distribution is outside the throughput region. A fluid model is adopted where superflows model traffic forwarding and backlog formations at the network level. Quantitative performance metrics of the overload including throughput, lexicographic minimization, most balanced allocation, and amount of lost traffic due to buffer overflow are considered to capture the information loss process due to overflow in the network. Optimal superflows with respect to these metrics are characterized and a distributed asynchronous algorithm that computes such superflows is given. The characterization of the optimal superflow amounts to obtaining a structural decomposition of the network in a sequence of disjoint subregions with decreasing overload such that traffic flows only from regions of higher overload to regions of lower overload. The optimal superflow represents the smoothest trajectory to overflow, followed by the network in case of instability."}
