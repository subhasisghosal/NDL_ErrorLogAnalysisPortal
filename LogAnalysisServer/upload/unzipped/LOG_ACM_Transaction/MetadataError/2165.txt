The user specifies displacements and internal elastic forces at a chosen set of mesh vertices. Our system then rapidly solves an optimization problem to compute a corresponding heterogeneous spatial distribution of material properties using the Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis. We apply our method to linear and nonlinear isotropic deformable materials. We demonstrate that solving the problem interactively in the full-dimensional space of individual tetrahedron material values is not practical. Instead, we propose a new model reduction method that projects the material space to a low-dimensional space of material modes. Our model reduction accelerates optimization by two orders of magnitude and makes the convergence much more robust, making it possible to interactively design material distributions on complex meshes. We apply our method to precise control of contact forces and control of pressure over large contact areas between rigid and deformable objects for ergonomics. Our tetrahedron-based dithering method can efficiently convert continuous material distributions into discrete ones and we demonstrate its precision via FEM simulation. We physically display our distributions using haptics, as well as demonstrate how haptics can aid in the material design. The produced heterogeneous material distributions can also be used in computer animation applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17266","fieldValue":"FEM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17267","fieldValue":" We present an augmented airbrush that allows novices to experience the art of spray painting. Inspired by the thriving field of smart tools, our handheld device uses 6DOF tracking, augmentation of the airbrush trigger, and a specialized algorithm to restrict the application of paint to a preselected reference image. Our device acts both as a physical spraying device and as an intelligent assistive tool, providing simultaneous manual and computerized control. Unlike prior art, here the virtual simulation guides the physical rendering (inverse rendering), allowing for a new spray painting experience with singular physical results. We present our novel hardware design, control software, and a user study that verifies our research objectives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17268","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}
