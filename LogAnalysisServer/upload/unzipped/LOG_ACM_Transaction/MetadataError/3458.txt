The algorithm is based on â\u20ACœstitchingâ\u20AC? together local structures by solving an optimization problem requiring the structures to fit together in an â\u20ACœAs-Rigid-As-Possibleâ\u20AC? manner, hence the name ARAP. The local structures consist of reference â\u20ACœpatchesâ\u20AC? and reference triangles, both obtained from inter-sensor distances. We elaborate on the relationship between the ARAP algorithm and other state-of-the-art algorithms, and provide experimental results demonstrating that ARAP is significantly less sensitive to sparse connectivity and measurement noise. We also show how ARAP may be distributed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21324","fieldValue":"Bar-Noy, Amotz"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21324","fieldValue":" When a sensor network is deployed, it is typically required to support multiple simultaneous missions. Schemes that assign sensing resources to missions thus become necessary. In this article, we formally define the sensor-mission assignment problem and discuss some of its variants. In its most general form, this problem is NP-hard. We propose algorithms for the different variants, some of which include approximation guarantees. We also propose distributed algorithms to assign sensors to missions which we adapt to include energy-awareness to extend network lifetime. Finally, we show comprehensive simulation results comparing these solutions to an upper bound on the optimal solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1223","fieldValue":"De Palma, Noel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1223","fieldValue":" Autonomic computing enables computing infrastructures to perform administration tasks with minimal human intervention. This wrap-up paper describes the experience we gained with the design and use of Jade---an architecture-based autonomic system. The contributions of this article are, (1) to explain how Jade provides autonomic management of a distributed system through an architecture-based approach, (2) to explain how we extended autonomic management from traditional self behaviors such as repairing or protecting a managed system to self-self behaviors where Jade also fully manages itself as it manages any other distributed system, (3) to report on our experience reaching self-self behaviors for two crucial autonomic properties, repair and protection."}
