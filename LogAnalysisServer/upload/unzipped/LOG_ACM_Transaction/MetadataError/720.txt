{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13187","fieldValue":" Power Gating has become one of the most widely used circuit design techniques for reducing leakage current. Its concept is very simple, but its application to standard-cell VLSI designs involves many careful considerations. The great complexity of designing a power-gated circuit originates from the side effects of inserting current switches, which have to be resolved by a combination of extra circuitry and customized tools and methodologies. In this tutorial we survey these design considerations and look at the best practice within industry and academia. Topics include output isolation and data retention, current switch design and sizing, and physical design issues such as power networks, increases in area and wirelength, and power grid analysis. Designers can benefit from this tutorial by obtaining a better understanding of implications of power gating during an early stage of VLSI designs. We also review the ways in which power gating has been improved. These include reducing the sizes of switches, cutting transition delays, applying power gating to smaller blocks of circuitry, and reducing the energy dissipated in mode transitions. Power Gating has also been combined with other circuit techniques, and these hybrids are also reviewed. Important open problems are identified as a stimulus to research."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13187","fieldValue":"VLSI"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13188","fieldValue":"Yu, Cheng-Juei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13188","fieldValue":"Wu, Yi-Hsin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13188","fieldValue":"Wang, Sheng-De"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13188","fieldValue":" We propose an in-place search algorithm for computing the exact solutions to the resource constrained scheduling problem. This algorithm supports operation chaining, pipelining and multicycling in the underlying scheduling problem. Based on two lower-bound estimation mechanisms that are capable of predicting the criterion values of search nodes represented by partially scheduled data flow graphs, the proposed algorithm can effectively prune the nonpromising search space and finds the optimum usually several times faster than existing techniques. As opposed to existing search-based scheduling techniques whose space complexity is squared or exponential in the search depth, our approach requires only a constant storage space during the traversal of the search tree. The low space complexity is accomplished by using a combination-generating algorithm, which leads our approach to visit search nodes in such a way that each one is obtained by making only a small change to its sibling without keeping any parent nodes in memory. Experimental results on several well known benchmarks with varying resource constraints show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13188","fieldValue":"An in-place search algorithm for the resource constrained scheduling problem during high-level synthesis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13188","fieldValue":"ACM"}
