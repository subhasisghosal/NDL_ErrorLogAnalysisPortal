{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1510","fieldValue":" The widespread availability of digital media has changed the way that people consume information and has impacted the consumption of auditory information. Despite this recent popularity among sighted people, the use of auditory feedback to access digital information is not new for visually impaired users. However, its sequential nature undermines both blind and sighted peopleâ\u20AC™s ability to efficiently find relevant information in the midst of several potentially useful items. We propose taking advantage of the Cocktail Party Effect, which states that people are able to focus on a single speech source among several conversations, but still identify relevant content in the background. Therefore, in contrast to one sequential speech channel, we hypothesize that people can leverage concurrent speech channels to quickly get the gist of digital information. In this article, we present an experiment with 46 (23 blind, 23 sighted) participants, which aims to understand peopleâ\u20AC™s ability to search for relevant content listening to two, three, or four concurrent speech channels. Our results suggest that both blind and sighted people are able to process concurrent speech in scanning scenarios. In particular, the use of two concurrent sources may be used both to identify and understand the content of the relevant sentence. Moreover, three sources may be used for most people depending on the task intelligibility demands and user characteristics. Contrasting with related work, the use of different voices did not affect the perception of concurrent speech but was highly preferred by participants. To complement the analysis, we propose a set of scenarios that may benefit from the use of concurrent speech sources, for both blind and sighted people, toward a Design for All paradigm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6071","fieldValue":" Nash equilibrium takes optimization as a primitive, but suboptimal behavior can persist in simple stochastic decision problems. This has motivated the development of other equilibrium concepts such as cursed equilibrium and behavioral equilibrium. We experimentally study a simple adverse selection (or â\u20ACœlemonsâ\u20AC?) problem and find that learning models that heavily discount past information (i.e., display recency bias) explain patterns of behavior better than Nash, cursed, or behavioral equilibrium. Providing counterfactual information or a record of past outcomes does little to aid convergence to optimal strategies, but providing sample averages (â\u20ACœrecapsâ\u20AC?) gets individuals most of the way to optimality. Thus, recency effects are not solely due to limited memory but stem from some other form of cognitive constraints. Our results show the importance of going beyond static optimization and incorporating features of human learning into economic models used in both understanding phenomena and designing market institutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6071","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6071","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6072","fieldValue":" We analyze the number of payoff queries needed to compute approximate equilibria of multi-player games. We find that query complexity is an effective tool for distinguishing the computational difficulty of alternative solution concepts, and we develop new techniques for upper- and lower bounding the query complexity. For binary-choice games, we show logarithmic upper and lower bounds on the query complexity of approximate correlated equilibrium. For well-supported approximate correlated equilibrium (a restriction where a playerâ\u20AC™s behavior must always be approximately optimal, in the worst case over draws from the distribution) we show a linear lower bound, thus separating the query complexity of well supported approximate correlated equilibrium from the standard notion of approximate correlated equilibrium. Finally, we give a query-efficient reduction from the problem of computing an approximate well-supported Nash equilibrium to the problem of verifying a well supported Nash equilibrium, where the additional query overhead is proportional to the description length of the game. This gives a polynomial-query algorithm for computing well supported approximate Nash equilibria (and hence correlated equilibria) in concisely represented games. We identify a class of games (which includes congestion games) in which the reduction can be made not only query efficient, but also computationally efficient."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6072","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6072","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6073","fieldValue":" We study the deterministic and randomized query complexity of finding approximate equilibria in a k Ã\u2014 k bimatrix game. We show that the deterministic query complexity of finding an &epsi;-Nash equilibrium when &epsilon < Â½ is $Î©(k^2), even in zero-one constant-sum games. In combination with previous results [Fearnley et al. 2013], this provides a complete characterization of the deterministic query complexity of approximate Nash equilibria. We also study randomized querying algorithms. We give a randomized algorithm for finding a (3âˆ\u2019&sqrt;5\/2 + Îµ)-Nash equilibrium using O(k.log k\/Îµ2) payoff queries, which shows that the Â½ barrier for deterministic algorithms can be broken by randomization. For well-supported Nash equilibria (WSNE), we first give a randomized algorithm for finding an &epsi;-WSNE of a zero-sum bimatrix game using O(k.log k\/Îµ4) payoff queries, and we then use this to obtain a randomized algorithm for finding a (&frac23; + Îµ)-WSNE in a general bimatrix game using O(k.log k\/Îµ4) payoff queries. Finally, we initiate the study of lower bounds against randomized algorithms in the context of bimatrix games, by showing that randomized algorithms require Î©(k2$) payoff queries in order to find an &epsi;-Nash equilibrium with Îµ < 1\/4k, even in zero-one constant-sum games. In particular, this rules out query-efficient randomized algorithms for finding exact Nash equilibria."}
