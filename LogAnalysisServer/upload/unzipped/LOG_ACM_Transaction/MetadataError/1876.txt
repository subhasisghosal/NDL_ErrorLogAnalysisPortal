{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1182","fieldValue":" We address the problem of cooperation in decentralized systems, specifically looking at interactions between independent pairs of peers where mutual exchange of resources (e.g., updating or sharing content) is required. In the absence of any enforcement mechanism or protocol, there is no incentive for one party to directly reciprocate during a transaction with another. Consequently, for such decentralized systems to function, protocols for self-organization need to explicitly promote cooperation in a manner where adherence to the protocol is incentivized. In this article we introduce a new generic model to achieve this. The model is based on peers repeatedly interacting to build up and maintain a dynamic social network of others that they can trust based on similarity of cooperation. This mechanism effectively incentivizes unselfish behavior, where peers with higher levels of cooperation gain higher payoff. We examine the model's behavior and robustness in detail. This includes the effect of peers self-adapting their cooperation level in response to maximizing their payoff, representing a Nash-equilibrium of the system. The study shows that the formation of a social network based on reflexive cooperation levels can be a highly effective and robust incentive mechanism for autonomous decentralized systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1182","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1182","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2567","fieldValue":"Chan, Ho-Leung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2567","fieldValue":"Marchetti-Spaccamela, Alberto"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2567","fieldValue":" We investigate the preemptive scheduling of periodic tasks with hard deadlines. We show that, even in the uniprocessor case, no pseudopolynomial-time algorithm can test the feasibility of a task system within a constant speedup bound, unless P = NP. This result contrasts with recent results for sporadic task systems. For two special cases, synchronous task systems and systems with a constant number of different task types, we provide the first polynomial-time constant-speedup feasibility tests for multiprocessor platforms. Furthermore, we show that the problem of testing feasibility is coNP-hard for synchronous multiprocessor task systems. The complexity of some of these problems has been open for a long time. We also propose a weight maximization variant of the feasibility problem, where every task has a nonnegative weight, and the goal is to find a subset of tasks that can be scheduled feasibly and has maximum weight. We give the first constant-speed, constant-approximation algorithm for the case of synchronous task systems, together with related hardness results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2567","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2567","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16530","fieldValue":" We present a method for rendering 3D paintings by compositing brush strokes embedded in space. The challenge in compositing 3D brush strokes is reconciling conflicts between their z-order in 3D and the order in which the strokes were painted, while maintaining temporal and spatial coherence. Our algorithm smoothly transitions between compositing closer strokes over those farther away and compositing strokes painted later over those painted earlier. It is efficient, running in O(n log n) time, and simple to implement. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a variety of 3D paintings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16530","fieldValue":"ACM"}
