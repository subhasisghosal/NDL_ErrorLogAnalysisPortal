The integration of MRAM in FPGAs allows the logic circuit to rapidly configure the algorithm, the routing and logic functions, and easily realize the Runtime Reconfiguration (RTR) and multicontext configuration. However, the conventional MRAM technology based on the Field Induced Magnetic Switching (FIMS) writing approach consumes very high power, large circuit surfaces, and produces high disturbance between memory cells. These drawbacks prevent FIMS-MRAMâ\u20AC™s further development in memory and logic circuit. Thermally Assisted Switching (TAS)-based MRAM is then evaluated to address these issues. In this article, some design techniques, novel computing architecture, and logic components for FPGA logic circuits based on TAS-MRAM technology are presented. By using STMicroelectronics CMOS 90nm technology and a complete TAS-MTJ spice model, some chip characteristic results such as the programming latency (~25ns) and power dissipation (~124pJ) have been calculated or simulated to demonstrate the expected performance of TAS-MRAM-based FPGA logic circuits."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21718","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21718","fieldValue":"MRAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21718","fieldValue":"MTJ"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21718","fieldValue":"TAS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21718","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21718","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21719","fieldValue":" In this work, we present hardware decompression accelerators for widening the bottleneck between slow nonvolatile memories on the one side and high-speed FPGA configuration interfaces and fast softcore CPUs on the other side. We discuss different compression algorithms suitable for a hardware accelerated decompression on FPGAs as well as on CPLDs. The algorithms will be investigated with respect to the achievable compression ratio, throughput, and hardware overhead. This leads to various decompressor implementations with one capable to decompress at high data rates of up to 400 megabytes per second under optimal conditions while only requiring slightly more than a hundred lookup tables. We will evaluate how these decompressors perform on configuration bitstreams for different FPGAs as well as for softcore CPU binaries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21719","fieldValue":"ACM"}
