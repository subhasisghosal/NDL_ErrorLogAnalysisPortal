We describe a modification of the random projection algorithm, called the uniform projection algorithm, which utilizes a different choice of projections. We replace the random selection of projections by a greedy heuristic that approximately equalizes the coverage of the projections. We show that this change in selection of projections leads to improved performance on motif discovery problems. Furthermore, the uniform projection algorithm is directly applicable to other problems where the random projection algorithm has been used, including comparison of protein sequence databases."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4173","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4173","fieldValue":"Index Terms- Motif discovery, transcription factor binding sites, random projection, combinatorial designs, low-discrepancy sequences."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4103","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4174","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4174","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4174","fieldValue":"ACM"}
