We investigate the problem from a game theory perspective, where the two optimization objectives are considered as game players. The cost model of each player is mapped through a generalized optimization framework onto protocol-specific MAC parameters. From the optimization framework, a game is first defined by the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) to assure energy consumption and e2e delay balancing. Secondy, the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution (KSBS) is used to find an equal proportion of gain between players. Both methods offer a bargaining solution to the duty-cycle MAC protocol under different axioms. As a result, given the two performance requirements (i.e., the maximum latency tolerated by the application and the initial energy budget of nodes), the proposed framework allows to set tunable system parameters to reach a fair equilibrium point that dually minimizes the system latency and energy consumption. For illustration, this formulation is applied to six state-of-the-art wireless sensor network (WSN) MAC protocols: B-MAC, X-MAC, RI-MAC, SMAC, DMAC, and LMAC. The article shows the effectiveness and scalability of such a framework in optimizing protocol parameters that achieve a fair energy-delay performance trade-off under the application requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21606","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21606","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21607","fieldValue":" The energy consumption of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) correlates with the voltage level at which the nodes are poweredâ\u20AC\u201Da lowered voltage leads to a prolonged lifetime of nodes and networks.

In this article, we show that a WSN can still work reliably, even if the voltage recommendations are violated. We show that there is a correlation between temperature and error-proneness at the same voltage level and that ideal voltage levels depend on environmental conditions. Especially in outdoor deployments, temperatures fluctuate often and heavily. Additionally, we show that these ideal voltage levels are different for each individual node. To deal with these individual variations and varying temperatures, we present a supervised learning strategy that is able to keep the nodes in uncritical states even if environmental conditions are constantly and heavily changing while saving as much energy as possible by constantly adapting the voltage level of these nodes to an individually ideal level. All measurements were performed on sensor node prototypes that are also presented in this article. In detailed evaluations, it is shown (i) that a single node will never run in the same unsafe state twice, (ii) that only five known bias points are needed to predict nearly all temperature dependencies for an individual node, and, thus, (iii) that a system of undervolted nodes can be as reliable as a conventionally powered network while prolonging the lifetime by more than 40&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21607","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21607","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21608","fieldValue":" Time synchronization is critical for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) because data fusion and duty cycling schemes all rely on synchronized schedules. Traditional synchronization protocols assume that wireless channels are available around the clock. However, this assumption is not true for WSNs deployed in intertidal zones. In this article, we present TACO, a synchronization scheme for WSNs with intermittent wireless channels and volatile environmental temperatures. TACO estimates the correlation of clock skews and temperatures by solving a constrained least squares problem and continuously adjusts the local time with the predicted clock skews according to temperatures. Our experiment conducted in an intertidal zone shows that TACO can greatly reduce the clock drift and prolong the resynchronization intervals."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21609","fieldValue":" Participatory sensing is a powerful paradigm that takes advantage of smartphones to collect and analyze data beyond the scale of what was previously possible.
