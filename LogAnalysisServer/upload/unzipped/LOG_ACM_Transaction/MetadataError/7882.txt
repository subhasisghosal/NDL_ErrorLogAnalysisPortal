We propose, implement, and evaluate an online, adaptive measurement platform, which utilizes real-time traffic analysis results to refine subsequent traffic measurements. Central to our solution is the concept of Multi-Resolution Tiling (MRT), a heuristic approach that performs sequential analysis of traffic data to zoom into traffic subregions of interest. However, MRT is sensitive to transient traffic spikes. In this paper, we propose three novel traffic streaming algorithms that overcome the limitations of MRT and can cater to varying degrees of computational and storage budgets, detection latency, and accuracy of query response. We evaluate our streaming algorithms on a highly parallel and programmable hardware as well as a traditional software-based platforms. The algorithms demonstrate significant accuracy improvement over MRT in detecting anomalies consisting of synthetic hard-to-track elephant flows and global icebergs. Our proposed algorithms maintain the worst-case complexities of the MRT while incurring only a moderate increase in average resource utilization."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10577","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10577","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10577","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10578","fieldValue":"koberne, Nejc"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10578","fieldValue":" The growth of the Internet has made IPv4 addresses a scarce resource. Due to slow IPv6 deployment, IANA-level IPv4 address exhaustion was reached before the world could transition to an IPv6-only Internet. The continuing need for IPv4 reachability will only be supported by IPv4 address sharing. This paper reviews ISP-level address sharing mechanisms, which allow Internet service providers to connect multiple customers who share a single IPv4 address. Some mechanisms come with severe and unpredicted consequences, and all of them come with tradeoffs. We propose a novel classification, which we apply to existing mechanisms such as NAT444 and DS-Lite and proposals such as 4rd, MAP, etc. Our tradeoff analysis reveals insights into many problems including: abuse attribution, performance degradation, address and port usage efficiency, direct intercustomer communication, and availability."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10578","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10578","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10578","fieldValue":"ACM"}
