Hints describe constraints on sizes and shapes inside characters and across the font that should be preserved during rasterization. We describe a novel, fast and fully automatic method for adding those hints to characters. The method is based on identifying hinting situations inside characters. It includes gathering global font information and linking it to characters, defining a set of constraints, sorting them, and converting them to hints in any known hinting technology (PostScript, TrueType or other). Our scheme is general enough to be applied on any language and on complex scripts such as Chinese Japanese and Korean. Although still inferior to expert manual hinting, our method produces high quality bitmaps which approach this goal. The method can also be used as a solid base for further hinting refinements done manually."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15293","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15293","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15294","fieldValue":" In this paper we introduce a new approach to realistic rendering at interactive rates on commodity graphics hardware. The approach uses efficient perceptual metrics within a decision theoretic framework to optimally order rendering operations, producing images of the highest visual quality within system constraints. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for various applications such as diffuse texture caching, environment map prioritization and radiosity mesh simplification. Although here we address the problem of realistic rendering at interactive rates, the perceptually-based decision theoretic methodology we introduce can be usefully applied in many areas of computer graphics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15294","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15294","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15295","fieldValue":" Typical high-level directives for locomotion of human-like characters are useful for interactive games and simulations as well as for off-line production animation. In this paper, we present a new scheme for planning natural-looking locomotion of a biped figure to facilitate rapid motion prototyping and task-level motion generation. Given start and goal positions in a virtual environment, our scheme gives a sequence of motions to move from the start to the goal using a set of live-captured motion clips. Based on a novel combination of probabilistic path planning and hierarchical displacement mapping, our scheme consists of three parts: roadmap construction, roadmap search, and motion generation. We randomly sample a set of valid footholds of the biped figure from the environment to construct a directed graph, called a roadmap, that guides the locomotion of the figure. Every edge of the roadmap is associated with a live-captured motion clip. Augmenting the roadmap with a posture transition graph, we traverse it to obtain the sequence of input motion clips and that of target footprints. We finally adapt the motion sequence to the constraints specified by the footprint sequence to generate a desired locomotion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15295","fieldValue":"ACM"}
