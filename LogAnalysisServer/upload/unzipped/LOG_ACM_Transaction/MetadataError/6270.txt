The development and evaluation of a wireless wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor to detect epileptic seizures from changes in the cardiac rhythm is described. The ECG data are analyzed by embedded algorithms: a robust beat-detection algorithm combined with a real-time epileptic seizure detector. In its current implementation, the proposed prototype is 52Ã\u2014 36Ã\u2014 $15mm^3$, and has an autonomy of one day.

The success of Java technology largely depends on the efficiency in executing the portable Java bytecodes. However, the dynamic characteristics of the Java runtime system present unique performance challenges for several aspects of microarchitecture design. In this work, we focus on the effects of indirect branches on branch-target address prediction performance. Runtime bytecode translation, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, frequent calls to the native interface libraries, and dependence on virtual methods increase the frequency of polymorphic indirect branches. Therefore, accurate target address prediction for indirect branches is very important for Java code.This paper characterizes the indirect branch behavior in Java processing and proposes an adaptive branch-target buffer (BTB) design to enhance the predictability of the targets. Our characterization shows that a traditional BTB will frequently mispredict a few polymorphic indirect branches, significantly deteriorating predictor accuracy in Java processing. Therefore, we propose a rehashable branch-target buffer (R-BTB), which dynamically identifies polymorphic indirect branches and adapts branch-target storage to accommodate multiple targets for a branch.The R-BTB improves the target predictability of indirect branches without sacrificing overall target prediction accuracy. Simulations show that the R-BTB eliminates 61&percnt; of the indirect branch mispredictions suffered with a traditional BTB for Java programs running in interpreter mode (46&percnt; in JIT mode), which leads to a 57&percnt; decrease in overall target address misprediction rate (29&percnt; in JIT mode). With an equivalent number of entries, the R-BTB also outperforms the previously proposed target cache scheme for a majority of Java programs by adapting to a greater variety of indirect branch behaviors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1614","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1614","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6699","fieldValue":" Wearable, unobtrusive and patient friendly physiological sensors will be a key driving force in the wireless health revolution. Cardiac (ECG) and brain (EEG) signals are two important signal modalities indicative of healthy and diseased states of body and mind that directly benefit from long-term monitoring. Despite advancements in wireless and embedded electronics technology, however, ECG\/EEG monitoring devices still face problems with patient compliance and comfort from the use wet\/gel electrodes. We have developed two wireless biopotential instrumentation systems using noncontact electrodes that can operate without direct skin contact and through thin layers of fabric. The first system is a general purpose replacement for traditional ECG\/EEG telemetry systems and the second is a compact, fully self-contained wireless ECG tag. All of the issues relating to the design of low noise, high performance noncontact sensors are discussed along with full technical details, circuit schematics and construction techniques. The noncontact electrode has been integrated into both a wearable ECG chest harness as well an EEG headband and characterized in a battery of experiments that represent potential health applications including resting ECG, exercise ECG and EEG directly against standard clinical adhesive Ag\/AgCl electrodes. With careful design and secure mechanical harnesses the noncontact sensor is capable of approaching the quality of conventional electrodes."}
