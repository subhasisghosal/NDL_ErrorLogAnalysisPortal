However, as there exist multiple paths for flows of packets to traverse through load-balanced switches, packets in such switches may be delivered out of order. In this paper, we propose a new switch architecture, called the contention and reservation (CR) switch, that not only delivers packets in order but also guarantees 100% throughput. The key idea, as in a multiple-access channel, is to operate the CR switch in two modes: 1) the contention mode in light traffic and 2) the reservation mode in heavy traffic. To do this, we invent a new buffer management scheme, called virtual output queue with insertion (I-VOQ).With the I-VOQ scheme, we give rigorous mathematical proofs for 100% throughput and in-order packet delivery of the CR switch. By computer simulations, we also demonstrate that the average packet delay of the CR switch is considerably lower than other schemes in the literature, including the uniform frame spreading scheme [10], the padded frame scheme [8], and the mailbox switch [5]."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9934","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9935","fieldValue":" Commonly used measures of traffic burstiness do not capture the fluctuation of traffic variability over the entire range of time-scales. In this paper, we present a measure of variability, called the Index of Variability (Hv(Ï\u201E)), that depicts the degree of variability (burstiness) of a typical network traffic process at each time-scale and is analytically tractable for many traffic models. As an illustration, we derive the closed-form expressions of Hv(Ï\u201E) for two traditional traffic models and generate a variety of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Index-of-Variability curves. These curves demonstrate that the Index of Variability can help in determining the complexities of the network traffic variability over the network performance relevant time-scales. We then introduce a practical method for estimating the Index-of-Variability curve from a given traffic trace. Using this method, we estimate the Index-of-Variability curves for 12 long NLANR network traffic traces. The results indicate that the variability of real network traffic varies with time-scales and that the Index of Variability has the ability to discern qualitative differences between traffic traces obtained from different networks. Thus, the Index of Variability offers the potential to gain insights into the dynamics of network traffic that existing tools do not offer."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9935","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9935","fieldValue":"ACM"}
