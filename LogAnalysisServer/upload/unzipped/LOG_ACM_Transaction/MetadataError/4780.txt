Over the last few years, we have witnessed a surge of attention on studying near-duplicate image\/keyframe retrieval in the multimedia community. To facilitate an effective approach to NDK retrieval on large-scale data, we suggest an effective Multi-Level Ranking (MLR) scheme that effectively retrieves NDKs in a coarse-to-fine manner. One key stage of the MLR ranking scheme is how to learn an effective ranking function with extremely small training examples in a near-duplicate detection task. To attack this challenge, we employ a semi-supervised learning method, semi-supervised support vector machines, which is able to significantly improve the retrieval performance by exploiting unlabeled data. Another key stage of the MLR scheme is to perform a fine matching among a subset of keyframe candidates retrieved from the previous coarse ranking stage. In contrast to previous approaches based on either simple heuristics or rigid matching models, we propose a novel Nonrigid Image Matching (NIM) approach to tackle near-duplicate keyframe retrieval from real-world video corpora in order to conduct an effective fine matching. Compared with the conventional methods, the proposed NIM approach can recover explicit mapping between two near-duplicate images with a few deformation parameters and find out the correct correspondences from noisy data simultaneously. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we performed extensive experiments on two benchmark testbeds extracted from the TRECVID2003 and TRECVID2004 corpora. The promising results indicate that our proposed method is more effective than other state-of-the-art approaches for near-duplicate keyframe retrieval."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25389","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25390","fieldValue":"Hsu, Cheng-Hsin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25390","fieldValue":" We present a general framework for optimizing the quality of video streaming in wireless networks that are composed of multiple wireless stations. The framework is general because: (i) it can be applied to different wireless networks, such as IEEE 802.11e WLAN and IEEE 802.16 WiMAX, (ii) it can employ different objective functions for the optimization, and (iii) it can adopt various models for the wireless channel, the link layer, and the distortion of the video streams in the application layer. The optimization framework controls parameters in different layers to optimally allocate the wireless network resources among all stations. More specifically, we address this video optimization problem in two steps. First, we formulate an abstract optimization problem for video streaming in wireless networks in general. This formulation exposes the important interaction between parameters belonging to different layers in the network stack. Then, we instantiate and solve the general problem for the recent IEEE 802.11e WLANs, which support prioritized traffic classes. We show how the calculated optimal solutions can efficiently be implemented in the distributed mode of the IEEE 802.11e standard. We evaluate our proposed solution using extensive simulations in the OPNET simulator, which captures most features of realistic wireless networks. In addition, to show the practicality of our solution, we have implemented it in the driver of an off-the-shelf wireless adapter that complies with the IEEE 802.11e standard. Our experimental and simulation results show that significant quality improvement in video streams can be achieved using our solution, without incurring any significant communication or computational overhead. We also explain how the general video optimization problem can be applied to other wireless networks, in particular, to the IEEE 802.16 WiMAX networks, which are becoming very popular."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25390","fieldValue":"WLAN"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25390","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25390","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25391","fieldValue":" Contemporary systems use centralized as well as peer-to-peer mechanisms for the large scale distribution of media objects. In this work, we investigate a serendipitous mechanism for directly sharing media objects among a local community of wireless users. This localized sharing is attractive when wide area network connectivity is undesirable, expensive or unavailable; especially when the shared media objects are large. With some restrictions, such localized sharing of media objects is also acceptable to content owners. However, localized sharing has to contend with far fewer media providers who may also not offer the variety of objects available from wide-area services. We collected empirical data from the widely deployed Apple iTunes application for our analysis. We showed that users are already making a significant amount of media objects available for serendipitous sharing. Our analysis showed that the shared object annotations exhibited a Zipfian long tail distribution. The availability patterns of wireless iTunes users and the object annotations makes serendipitous sharing inappropriate for scenarios that require access to a specific object. Instead, mechanisms that allow the user to specify classes of interesting objects are better suited for such users. Also, given the smaller scale of these systems, serendipitous sharing can benefit from approaches that allow users to disseminate a compact representation of their shared objects. Though the wireless user availability rates was not as high as what was observed in a corporate desktop setting, a large fraction of the users showed high temporal consistency. This allows for high availability with reasonable replication during weekday daytime hours. We answer important questions regarding the viability of a campus-wide media sharing system."}
