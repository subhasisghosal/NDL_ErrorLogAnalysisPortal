In order to determine the required precision for this environment, an experiment was performed to psychophysically measure colorimetric tolerances for six images using paired comparison techniques. These images were manipulated using 10 linear and nonlinear functions in the CIELAB dimensions of lightness, chroma, and hue angle. Perceptibility tolerances were determined using probit analysis. From these results, the necessary precision in number of bits per color channel was determined for both the CIELAB and the CRT rgb device color spaces. For both the CIELAB color space and the CRT rgb device space, approximately eight color bits per channel were required for imperceptible color differences for pictorial images, and 10 bits per channel were required for computational precision."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15078","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15078","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15079","fieldValue":"DeRose, Tony D."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15079","fieldValue":" In view of the fundamental role that functional composition plays in mathematics, it is not surprising that a variety of problems in geometric modeling can be viewed as instances of the following composition problem: given representations for two functions F and G, compute a representation of the function H = F o G. We examine this problem in detail for the case when F and G are given in either BeÂ´zier or B-spline form. Blossoming techniques are used to gain theoretical insight into the structure of the solution which is then used to develop efficient, tightly codable algorithms. From a practical point of view, if the composition algorithms are implemented as library routines, a number of geometric-modeling problems can be solved with a small amount of additional software."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/15079","fieldValue":"Be&acute;zier curves"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/15079","fieldValue":"Triangular Be&acute;zier surface patches"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15079","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15079","fieldValue":"ACM"}
