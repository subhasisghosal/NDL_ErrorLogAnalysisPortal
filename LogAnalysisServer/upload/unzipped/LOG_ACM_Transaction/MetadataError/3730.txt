{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21990","fieldValue":" In this article, we present an algorithmic system for determining the proper correspondence between place markers and their labels in historical maps. We assume that the locations of place markers (usually pictographs) and labels (pieces of text) have already been determined -- either algorithmically or by hand -- and we want to match the labels to the markers. This time-consuming step in the digitization process of historical maps is nontrivial even for humans but provides valuable metadata (e.g., when subsequently georeferencing the map). To speed up this process, we model the problem in terms of combinatorial optimization, solve that problem efficiently, and show how user interaction can be used to improve the quality of the results. We also consider a version of the model where we are given label fragments and additionally have to decide which fragments go together. We show that this problem is NP-hard. However, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for a restricted version of this fragment assignment problem. We have implemented the algorithm for the main problem and tested it on a manually extracted ground truth for eight historical maps with a combined total of more than 12,800 markers and labels. On average, the algorithm correctly matches 96% of the labels and is robust against noisy input. It furthermore performs a sensitivity analysis and in this way computes a measure of confidence for each of the matches. We use this as the basis for an interactive system where the userâ\u20AC™s effort is directed to checking those parts of the map where the algorithm is unsure; any corrections the user makes are propagated by the algorithm. We discuss a prototype of this system and statistically confirm that it successfully locates those areas on the map where the algorithm needs help."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/21990","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Universit&#228;t W&#252;rzburg, Am Hubland, W&#252;rzburg (Budig, Benedikt; Dijk, Thomas C Van; Wolff, Alexander)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21991","fieldValue":" Local experts are critical for many location-sensitive information needs, and yet there is a research gap in our understanding of the factors impacting who is recognized as a local expert and in methods for discovering local experts. Hence, in this article, we explore a geo-spatial learning-to-rank framework for identifying local experts. Three of the key features of the proposed approach are: (i) a learning-based framework for integrating multiple user-based, content-based, list-based, and crowd-based factors impacting local expertise that leverages the fine-grained GPS coordinates of millions of social media users; (ii) a location-sensitive random walk that propagates crowd knowledge of a candidateâ\u20AC™s expertise; and (iii) a comprehensive controlled study over AMT-labeled local experts on eight topics and in four cities. We find significant improvements of local expert finding versus two state-of-the-art alternatives, as well as evidence for the generalizability of local expert ranking models to new topics and new locations."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/21991","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Texas A&#x38;M University, TX, USA (Niu, Wei; Liu, Zhijiao; Caverlee, James)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21992","fieldValue":"Lu, Chang-Tien"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21992","fieldValue":" Event forecasting from social media data streams has many applications. Existing approaches focus on forecasting temporal events (such as elections and sports) but as yet cannot forecast spatiotemporal events such as civil unrest and influenza outbreaks, which are much more challenging. To achieve spatiotemporal event forecasting, spatial features that evolve with time and their underlying correlations need to be considered and characterized. In this article, we propose novel batch and online approaches for spatiotemporal event forecasting in social media such as Twitter. Our models characterize the underlying development of future events by simultaneously modeling the structural contexts and their spatiotemporal burstiness based on different strategies. Both batch and online-based inference algorithms are developed to optimize the model parameters. Utilizing the trained model, the alignment likelihood of tweet sequences is calculated by dynamic programming. Extensive experimental evaluations on two different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."}
