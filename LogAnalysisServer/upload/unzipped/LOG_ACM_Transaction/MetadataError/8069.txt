{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10946","fieldValue":" Today's Internet makes hosts and individual networks inherently insecure because permanent addresses turn destinations into permanent attack targets. This paper describes an Evasive Internet Protocol (EIP), a change to the data plane of the Internet that: 1) prevents senders from forging their identities while preserving the current Internet privacy paradigm; 2) gives recipients full control over who can communicate with them and for how long; 3) achieves the above features without requiring global signaling protocols; and 4) allows coexistence with and graceful introduction into the current Internet. We motivate our approach, present the architectural design, and evaluate it through trace-driven and synthetic simulations as well as prototype testing."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/10946","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland (Johnson, Eamon; Rabinovich, Michael); Yarmouk University, Irbid, Jordan (Al-Qudah, Zakaria); AT&#38;T Labs---Research, Florham Park (Spatscheck, Oliver)"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10946","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10946","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10947","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of minimizing the power consumption of IP core networks by means of power aware configuration of the Points of Presence (PoPs), given general traffic demands on the links. Although the problem is in general NP-complete, we give an optimal algorithm for an important variant where the number of ports on each line-card chassis is 2. For the general problem, we design two approximation algorithms with respective P\/2 and 2 ln N approximation ratios, where P is the number of ports on each line-card chassis, and N is the number of chassis within the PoP. When the traffic demands are correlated, we prove that our algorithms are optimal. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our PoP configuration algorithms significantly outperform existing design solutions over a wide range of traffic instances."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10947","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10947","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10947","fieldValue":"ACM"}
