The paper focuses primarily on the gene normalization task of recognizing protein mentions in text and mapping them to the appropriate database identifiers based on contextual clues. We outline a \"â\u20ACœfuzzyâ\u20AC? dictionary lookup approach to protein mention detection that matches regularized text to similarly regularized dictionary entries. We describe several different strategies for gene normalization that focus on species or organism mentions in the text, both globally throughout the document and locally in the immediate vicinity of a protein mention, and present the results of experimentation with a series of system variations that explore the effectiveness of the various normalization strategies, as well as the role of external knowledge sources. While our system was neither the best nor the worst performing system in the evaluation, the gene normalization strategies show promise and the system affords the opportunity to explore some of the variables affecting performance on the BCII.5 tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4506","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4507","fieldValue":" We describe a system for the detection of mentions of protein-protein interactions in the biomedical scientific literature.

In this paper, we focus in particular on the participation to the BioCreative II.5 challenge, where the OntoGene system achieved best-ranked results. Additionally, we describe a feature-analysis experiment performed after the challenge, which shows the unexpected result that one single feature alone performs better than the combination of features used in the challenge."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4507","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
