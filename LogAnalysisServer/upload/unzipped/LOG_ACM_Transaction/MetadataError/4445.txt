{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24361","fieldValue":" The use of Internet-based distributed monitoring systems has allowed firms to source services globally that were hitherto thought of as being too risky or complex to execute offshore. These systems enable buyers of such services (clients) to monitor the execution of processes in real-time and exert a degree of managerial control over information workers of another firm located in a distant region. Our research shows that process codifiability plays a key role in determining output quality. Further, we show that the efforts made by the client and the provider in monitoring work via Internet-based monitoring mechanisms have a significant impact on output quality. Finally, we show that these monitoring mechanisms enable clients and providers of services to focus on those processes that are best managed by each entity. This scheme of optimal allocation of monitoring effort is termed by us as the efficient monitoring frontier."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24362","fieldValue":" Advances in distributed service-oriented computing and Internet technology have formed a strong technology push for outsourcing and information sharing. There is an increasing need for organizations to share their data across organization boundaries both within the country and with countries that may have lesser privacy and security standards. Ideally, we wish to share certain statistical data and extract the knowledge from the private databases without revealing any additional information of each individual database apart from the aggregate result that is permitted. In this article, we describe two scenarios for outsourcing data aggregation services and present a set of decentralized peer-to-peer protocols for supporting data sharing across multiple private databases while minimizing the data disclosure among individual parties. Our basic protocols include a set of novel probabilistic computation mechanisms for important primitive data aggregation operations across multiple private databases such as max, min, and top k selection. We provide an analytical study of our basic protocols in terms of precision, efficiency, and privacy characteristics. Our advanced protocols implement an efficient algorithm for performing kNN classification across multiple private databases. We provide a set of experiments to evaluate the proposed protocols in terms of their correctness, efficiency, and privacy characteristics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24363","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24363","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24364","fieldValue":" This article addresses search engine personalization. We present a new approach to mining a user's preferences on the search results from clickthrough data and using the discovered preferences to adapt the search engine's ranking function for improving search quality. We develop a new preference mining technique called SpyNB, which is based on the practical assumption that the search results clicked on by the user reflect the user's preferences but does not draw any conclusions about the results that the user did not click on. As such, SpyNB is still valid even if the user does not follow any order in reading the search results or does not click on all relevant results. Our extensive offline experiments demonstrate that SpyNB discovers many more accurate preferences than existing algorithms do. The interactive online experiments further confirm that SpyNB and our personalization approach are effective in practice. We also show that the efficiency of SpyNB is comparable to existing simple preference mining algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24364","fieldValue":"ACM"}
