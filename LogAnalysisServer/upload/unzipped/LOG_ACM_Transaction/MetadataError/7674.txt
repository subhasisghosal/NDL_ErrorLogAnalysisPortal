In this article, we propose VGRIS, a resource management framework for virtualized GPU resource isolation and scheduling in cloud gaming. A set of application programming interfaces (APIs) is provided so that a variety of scheduling algorithms can be implemented within the framework without modifying the framework itself. Three scheduling algorithms are implemented by the APIs within VGRIS. Experimental results show that VGRIS can effectively schedule GPU resources among various workloads."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1923","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1923","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1923","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10160","fieldValue":" The global network of data centers is emerging as an important distributed systems paradigm--commodity clusters running high-performance applications, connected by high-speed \"lambda\" networks across hundreds of milliseconds of network latency. Packet loss on long-haul networks can cripple applications and protocols: A loss rate as low as 0.1% is sufficient to reduce TCP\/IP throughput by an order of magnitude on a 1-Gb\/s link with 50-ms one-way latency. Maelstrom is an edge appliance that masks packet loss transparently and quickly from intercluster protocols, aggregating traffic for high-speed encoding and using a new forward error correction scheme to handle bursty loss."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10160","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
