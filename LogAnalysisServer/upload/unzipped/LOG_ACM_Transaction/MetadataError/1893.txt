Our main contribution is to derive a compact 1D circular Gaussian representation that can accurately model the hair scattering function introduced by [Marschner et al. 2003]. The primary benefit of this representation is that it enables us to evaluate, at run-time, closed-form integrals of the scattering function with each SRBF light, resulting in efficient computation of both single and multiple scatterings. In contrast to previous work, our algorithm computes the rendering integrals entirely on the fly and does not depend on expensive pre-computation. Thus we allow the user to dynamically change the hair scattering parameters, which can vary spatially. Analyses show that our 1D circular Gaussian representation is both accurate and concise. In addition, our algorithm incorporates the eccentricity of the hair. We implement our algorithm on the GPU, achieving interactive hair rendering and simultaneous appearance editing under complex environment maps for the first time."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16571","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16571","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16571","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16572","fieldValue":" We present a new image editing method, particularly effective for sharpening major edges by increasing the steepness of transition while eliminating a manageable degree of low-amplitude structures. The seemingly contradictive effect is achieved in an optimization framework making use of $L_0$ gradient minimization, which can globally control how many non-zero gradients are resulted in to approximate prominent structure in a sparsity-control manner. Unlike other edge-preserving smoothing approaches, our method does not depend on local features, but instead globally locates important edges. It, as a fundamental tool, finds many applications and is particularly beneficial to edge extraction, clip-art JPEG artifact removal, and non-photorealistic effect generation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/16572","fieldValue":"<i>L<\/i><sub>0<\/sub> sparsity"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16572","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16572","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16573","fieldValue":" We present a novel approach for rapid numerical approximation of convolutions with filters of large support. Our approach consists of a multiscale scheme, fashioned after the wavelet transform, which computes the approximation in linear time. Given a specific large target filter to approximate, we first use numerical optimization to design a set of small kernels, which are then used to perform the analysis and synthesis steps of our multiscale transform. Once the optimization has been done, the resulting transform can be applied to any signal in linear time. We demonstrate that our method is well suited for tasks such as gradient field integration, seamless image cloning, and scattered data interpolation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods."}
