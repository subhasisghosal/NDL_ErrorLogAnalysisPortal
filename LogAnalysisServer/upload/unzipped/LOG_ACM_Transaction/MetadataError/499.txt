In its simplest formulation it says that for every k > 0 and s > 0, there is a minimum number r(k, s) such that any simple graph with at least r(k, s) vertices contains either a clique of size k or an independent set of size s. We study the complexity of proving upper bounds for the number r(k, k). In particular, we focus on the propositional proof system cutting planes; we show that any cutting plane proof of the upper bound ‚\u20ACúr(k, k) &les; $4^k$‚\u20AC? requires high rank. In order to do that we show a protection lemma which could be of independent interest."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12559","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12559","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2202","fieldValue":"Carvalho, Marcelo H De"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2202","fieldValue":"cheriyan, joseph"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2202","fieldValue":" Our main result is an O(nm)-time (deterministic) algorithm for constructing an ear decomposition of a matching-covered graph, where n and m denote the number of nodes and edges. The improvement in the running time comes from new structural results that give a sharpened version of Lov√°sz and Plummer's Two-Ear Theorem. Our algorithm is based on O(nm)-time algorithms for two other fundamental problems in matching theory, namely, finding all the allowed edges of a graph, and finding the canonical partition of an elementary graph. To the best of our knowledge, no faster deterministic algorithms are known for these two fundamental problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12560","fieldValue":" This note proves the existence of a quadratic GF(2) map p&colon; {0, $1}^n$ ‚\u2020\u2019 {0, 1} such that no constant-depth circuit of size poly(n) can sample the distribution (u, p(u)) for uniform u."}
