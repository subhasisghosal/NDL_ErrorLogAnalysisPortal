{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23945","fieldValue":" Stemmers attempt to reduce a word to its stem or root form and are used widely in information retrieval tasks to increase the recall rate. Most popular stemmers encode a large number of language-specific rules built over a length of time. Such stemmers with comprehensive rules are available only for a few languages. In the absence of extensive linguistic resources for certain languages, statistical language processing tools have been successfully used to improve the performance of IR systems. In this article, we describe a clustering-based approach to discover equivalence classes of root words and their morphological variants. A set of string distance measures are defined, and the lexicon for a given text collection is clustered using the distance measures to identify these equivalence classes. The proposed approach is compared with Porter's and Lovin's stemmers on the AP and WSJ subcollections of the Tipster dataset using 200 queries. Its performance is comparable to that of Porter's and Lovin's stemmers, both in terms of average precision and the total number of relevant documents retrieved. The proposed stemming algorithm also provides consistent improvements in retrieval performance for French and Bengali, which are currently resource-poor."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23946","fieldValue":" The increasing diffusion of XML languages for the encoding of domain-specific multimedia information raises the need for new information retrieval models that can fully exploit structural information. An XML language specifically designed for music like MX allows queries to be made directly on the thematic material. The main advantage of such a system is that it can handle symbolic, notational, and audio objects at the same time through a multilayered structure. On the model side, common music information retrieval methods do not take into account the inner structure of melodic themes and the metric relationships between notes. In this article we deal with two main topics: a novel architecture based on a new XML language for music and a new model of melodic themes based on graph theory. This model takes advantage of particular graph invariants that can be linked to melodic themes as metadata in order to characterize all their possible modifications through specific transformations and that can be exploited in filtering algorithms. We provide a similarity function and show through an evaluation stage how it improves existing methods, particularly in the case of same-structured themes."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23946","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23947","fieldValue":" Consider a website containing a collection of webpages with data such as in Yahoo or the Open Directory project. Each page is associated with a weight representing the frequency with which that page is accessed by users. In the tree hierarchy representation, accessing each page requires the user to travel along the path leading to it from the root. By enhancing the index tree with additional edges (hotlinks) one may reduce the access cost of the system. In other words, the hotlinks reduce the expected number of steps needed to reach a leaf page from the tree root, assuming that the user knows which hotlinks to take. The hotlink enhancement problem involves finding a set of hotlinks minimizing this cost. This article proposes the first exact algorithm for the hotlink enhancement problem. This algorithm runs in polynomial time for trees with logarithmic depth. Experiments conducted with real data show that significant improvement in the expected number of accesses per search can be achieved in websites using this algorithm. These experiments also suggest that the simple and much faster heuristic proposed previously by Czyzowicz et al. [2003] creates hotlinks that are nearly optimal in the time savings they provide to the user. The version of the hotlink enhancement problem in which the weight distribution on the leaves is unknown is discussed as well. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that is optimal for any tree for any depth."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23947","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23947","fieldValue":"ACM"}
