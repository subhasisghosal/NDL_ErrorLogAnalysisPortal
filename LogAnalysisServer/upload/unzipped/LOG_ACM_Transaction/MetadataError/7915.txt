Localizing electronic identifiers is more and more important for a fully digitalized life. However, traditional wireless localization techniques are not satisfactory in performance to determine these electronic identifiers' positions. Some of them require costly hardware to achieve high accuracy and, hence, are not practical. The others are inaccurate and not robust against environmental noises, e.g., RSSI-based localization. Therefore, an accurate and practical approach for localizing electronic identifiers is needed. In this paper, we propose a new localization technique called EV-Loc. In EV-Loc, we make use of visual signals to help improve the accuracy of wireless localization. Our technique fully takes advantage of the high accuracy of visual signals and pervasiveness of electronic signals. To effectively couple these two signals together, we have designed an E-V match engine to find the correspondence between an object's electronic identifier and its visual appearance. We have implemented our technique on mobile devices and evaluated it in the real world. The localization error is less than 1 m. We have also evaluated our approach using large-scale simulations. The results show that our approach is accurate and robust."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10644","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10644","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10644","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10645","fieldValue":" In this paper, we are interested in improving the performance of TCP flows over wireless networks with a given constructive intersession network coding scheme. We are motivated by the observation that TCP does not fully exploit the potential of the underlying network coding opportunities. In order to improve the performance of TCP flows over coded wireless networks, without introducing changes to TCP itself, we propose a network-coding aware queue management scheme (NCAQM) that is implemented at intermediate network coding nodes and bridges the gap between network coding and TCP rate control. The design of NCAQM is grounded on the network utility maximization (NUM) framework and includes the following mechanisms. NCAQM: 1) stores coded packets at intermediate nodes in order to use the buffer space more efficiently; 2) determines what fraction of the flows should be coded together; and 3) drops packets at intermediate nodes so that it matches the rates of parts of different TCP flows that are coded together. We demonstrate, via simulation, that NCAQM significantly improves TCP throughput compared to TCP over baseline queue management schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10645","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10645","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10645","fieldValue":"ACM"}
