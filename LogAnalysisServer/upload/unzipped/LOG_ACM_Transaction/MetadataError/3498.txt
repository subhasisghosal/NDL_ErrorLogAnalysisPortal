In this article, we show that network coding provides a means to elegantly balance these two goals. We present the design and implementation of SenseCode, a collection protocol for sensor networksâ\u20AC\u201Dand, to the best of our knowledge, the first such implemented protocol to employ network coding. SenseCode provides a way to gracefully introduce a configurable amount of redundant information into the network, thereby decreasing end-to-end packet error rate in the face of packet loss. We compare SenseCode to the best (to our knowledge) existing alternative and show that it reduces end-to-end packet error rate in highly dynamic environments, while consuming a comparable amount of network resources. We have implemented SenseCode as a TinyOS module and evaluate it through extensive TOSSIM simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21421","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2422966.2422982\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21421","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21421","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21422","fieldValue":" Knowing accurate positions of nodes in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks is essential for a wide range of pervasive and mobile applications. However, errors are inevitable in distance measurements and we observe that a small number of outliers can degrade localization accuracy drastically. To deal with noisy and outlier ranging results, triangle inequality, is often employed in existing approaches. Our study shows that triangle inequality has many limitations, which make it far from accurate and reliable. In this study, we formally define the outlier detection problem for network localization and build a theoretical foundation to identify outliers based on graph embeddability and rigidity theory. Our analysis shows that the redundancy of distance measurements plays an important role. We then design a bilateration generic cycles-based outlier detection algorithm, and examine its effectiveness and efficiency through a network prototype implementation of MicaZ motes as well as extensive simulations. The results show that our design significantly improves the localization accuracy by wisely rejecting outliers."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21422","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2422966.2422983\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21422","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21422","fieldValue":"ACM"}
