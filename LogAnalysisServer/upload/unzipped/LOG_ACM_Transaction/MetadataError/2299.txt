Such a decomposition is the basis for a variety of video manipulation applications, such as realistic recoloring or retexturing of objects. We present a novel variational approach to tackle this underconstrained inverse problem at real-time frame rates, which enables on-line processing of live video footage. The problem of finding the intrinsic decomposition is formulated as a mixed variational $&ell;2-&ell;_p$-optimization problem based on an objective function that is specifically tailored for fast optimization. To this end, we propose a novel combination of sophisticated local spatial and global spatio-temporal priors resulting in temporally coherent decompositions at real-time frame rates without the need for explicit correspondence search. We tackle the resulting high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem via a novel data-parallel iteratively reweighted least squares solver that runs on commodity graphics hardware. Real-time performance is obtained by combining a local-global solution strategy with hierarchical coarse-to-fine optimization. Compelling real-time augmented reality applications, such as recoloring, material editing and retexturing, are demonstrated in a live setup. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that we obtain high-quality real-time decompositions even for challenging sequences. Our method is able to outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of runtime and result quality -- even without user guidance such as scribbles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17597","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17597","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17598","fieldValue":"Simo-Serra, Edgar"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17598","fieldValue":" We present a novel technique to automatically colorize grayscale images that combines both global priors and local image features. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks, our deep network features a fusion layer that allows us to elegantly merge local information dependent on small image patches with global priors computed using the entire image. The entire framework, including the global and local priors as well as the colorization model, is trained in an end-to-end fashion. Furthermore, our architecture can process images of any resolution, unlike most existing approaches based on CNN. We leverage an existing large-scale scene classification database to train our model, exploiting the class labels of the dataset to more efficiently and discriminatively learn the global priors. We validate our approach with a user study and compare against the state of the art, where we show significant improvements. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method extensively on many different types of images, including black-and-white photography from over a hundred years ago, and show realistic colorizations."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17598","fieldValue":"Let there be color!: joint end-to-end learning of global and local image priors for automatic image colorization with simultaneous classification"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17598","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17598","fieldValue":"ACM"}
