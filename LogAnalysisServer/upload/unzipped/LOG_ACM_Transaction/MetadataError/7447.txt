Unfortunately, routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks typically work well only in bidirectional networks. This paper first presents a simulation study quantifying the impact of asymmetric links on network connectivity and routing performance. It then presents a framework called BRA that provides a bidirectional abstraction of the asymmetric network to routing protocols. BRA works by maintaining multi-hop reverse routes for unidirectional links and provides three new abilities: improved connectivity by taking advantage of the unidirectional links, reverse route forwarding of control packets to enable off-the-shelf routing protocols, and detection packet loss on unidirectional links. Extensive simulations of AODV layered on BRA show that packet delivery increases substantially (two-fold in some instances) in asymmetric networks compared to regular AODV, which only routes on bidirectional links."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9706","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9706","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9706","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9707","fieldValue":" This paper analyzes the asymptotic behavior of packet-train probing over a multi-hop network path P carrying arbitrarily routed bursty cross-traffic flows. We examine the statistical mean of the packet-train output dispersions and its relationship to the input dispersion. We call this relationship the response curve of path P. We show that the real response curve Z is tightly lower-bounded by its multi-hop fluid counterpart F, obtained when every cross-traffic flow on P is hypothetically replaced with a constant-rate fluid flow of the same average intensity and routing pattern. The real curve Z asymptotically approaches its fluid counterpart F as probing packet size or packet train length increases. Most existing measurement techniques are based upon the single-hop fluid curve S associated with the bottleneck link in P. We note that the curve S coincides with F in a certain large-dispersion input range, but falls below F in the remaining small-dispersion input ranges. As an implication of these findings, we show that bursty cross-traffic in multi-hop paths causes negative bias (asymptotic underestimation) to most existing techniques. This bias can be mitigated by reducing the deviation of Z from S using large packet size or long packet-trains. However, the bias is not completely removable for the techniques that use the portion of Sthat falls below F."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9707","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9707","fieldValue":"ACM"}
