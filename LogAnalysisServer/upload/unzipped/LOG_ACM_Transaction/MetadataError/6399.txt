Therefore, this paper presents a unified MAC layer architecture for resource-constrained M2M devices in capillary M2M networks &lsqb;named as resource-constrained MAC architecture (RCMA)&rsqb;, which has a unified (monolithic) framework consisting of essential functional components to support MAC-related operations of M2M devices: multi-channel hybrid MAC (McHM), logical link control (LLC), time synchronizer (TS), and device on--off scheduler (DO2S). McHM provides a baseline MAC protocol for an entire capillary M2M system that combines the benefit of both contention-based carrier sense multiple access and schedule-based time division multiple access schemes, whereas the other three components help in the McHM operations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the RCMA, we implement the whole stack using the QualNet simulator. Experimental results show that the RCMA outperforms the conventional ZigBee stack in terms of energy efficiency and scalability, even under heavy traffic conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7009","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7009","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7010","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7011","fieldValue":" In embedded systems operated by battery and interacting with the environment, a fundamental issue is the enforcement of real-time and energy constraints to guarantee a desired lifetime with a given performance. A lot of research has focused on energy management at the communication level; however, not many authors considered both real-time and energy requirements in wireless communication systems. This article proposes El-SMan, a power-aware framework working in combination with MAC layer communication protocols for maximizing battery lifetime in wireless networks of embedded systems with real-time constraints. Exploiting the flexibility in bandwidth requirements, El-SMan adapts stream parameters to balance performance versus energy consumption, taking both lifetime and message deadlines into account."}
