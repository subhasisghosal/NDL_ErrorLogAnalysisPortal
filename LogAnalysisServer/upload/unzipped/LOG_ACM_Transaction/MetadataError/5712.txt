Existing methods fall into approximate and exact ones. The former including greedy and heuristic ones can reduce the computational complexity, but suffer from information lost in the procedure of glycan interpretation. The latter including dynamic programming and exhaustive enumeration are much slower than the former. In the past years, nearly all emerging methods adopted a tree structure to represent a glycan. They share such problems as repetitive peak counting in reconstructing a candidate structure. Besides, tree-based glycan representation methods often have to give different computational formulas for binary and ternary glycans. We propose a new directed acyclic graph structure for glycan representation. Based on it, this work develops a de novo algorithm to accurately reconstruct the tree structure iteratively from mass spectra with logical constraints and some known biosynthesis rules, by a single computational formula. The experiments on multiple complex glycans extracted from human serum show that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher accuracy to determine a glycan topology than prior methods without increasing computational burden."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5140","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5140","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5140","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5141","fieldValue":"L, Jinhu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5141","fieldValue":" Noise can induce various dynamical behaviors in nonlinear systems. White noise perturbed systems have been extensively investigated during the last decades. In gene networks, experimentally observed extrinsic noise is colored. As an attempt, we investigate the genetic toggle switch systems perturbed by colored extrinsic noise and with kinetic parameters. Compared with white noise perturbed systems, we show there also exists optimal colored noise strength to induce the best stochastic switch behaviors in the single toggle switch, and the best synchronized switching in the networked systems, which demonstrate that noise-induced optimal switch behaviors are widely in existence. Moreover, under a wide range of system parameter regions, we find there exist wider ranges of white and colored noises strengths to induce good switch and synchronization behaviors, respectively; therefore, white noise is beneficial for switch and colored noise is beneficial for population synchronization. Our observations are very robust to extrinsic stimulus strength, cell density, and diffusion rate. Finally, based on the Waddington's epigenetic landscape and the Wiener-Khintchine theorem, physical mechanisms underlying the observations are interpreted. Our investigations can provide guidelines for experimental design, and have potential clinical implications in gene therapy and synthetic biology."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5141","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5141","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5141","fieldValue":"ACM"}
