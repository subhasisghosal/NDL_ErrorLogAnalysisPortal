{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15097","fieldValue":" This article develops a dynamic generalization of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) model. NURBS have become a defacto standard in commercial modeling systems because of their power to represent free-form shapes as well as common analytic shapes. To date, however, they have been viewed as purely geometric primitives that require the user to manually adjust multiple control points and associated weights in order to design shapes. Dynamic NURBS, or D-NURBS, are physics-based models that incorporate mass distributions, internal deformation energies, and other physical quantities into the popular NURBS geometric substrate. Using D-NURBS, a modeler can interactively sculpt curves and surfaces and design complex shapes to required specifications not only in the traditional indirect fashion, by adjusting control points and weights, but also through direct physical manipulation, by applying simulated forces and local and global shape constraints. D-NURBS move and deform in a physically intuitive manner in response to the user's direct manipulations. Their dynamic behavior results from the numerical integration of a set of nonlinear differential equations that automatically evolve the control points and weights in response to the applied forces and constraints. To derive these equations, we employ Lagrangian mechanics and a finite-element-like discretization. Our approach supports the trimming of D-NURBS surfaces using D-NURBS curves. We demonstrate D-NURBS models and constraints in applications including the rounding of solids, optimal surface fitting to unstructured data, surface design from cross sections, and free-form deformation. We also introduce a new technique for 2D shape metamorphosis using constrained D-NURBS surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15097","fieldValue":"CAGD"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15097","fieldValue":"NURBS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15097","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15097","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15098","fieldValue":" Deformations are a powerful tool for shape modeling and design. We present a new model for producing controlled spatial deformations, which we term Simple Constrained Deformations (Scodef). The user defines a set of constraint points, giving a desired displacement and radius of influence for each. Each constraint point determines a local B-spline basis function centered at the constraint point, falling to zero for points beyond the radius. The deformed image of any point in space is a blend of these basis functions, using a projection matrix computed to satisfy the constraints. The deformation operates on the whole space regardless of the representation of the objects embedded inside the space. The constraints directly influence the final shape of the deformed objects, and this shape can be fine-tuned by adjusting the radius of influence of each constraint point. The computations required by the technique can be done very efficiently, and real-time interactive deformation editing on current workstations is possible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15098","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15098","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15099","fieldValue":"Hel-Or, Yaacov"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15099","fieldValue":" Point displacement constraints constitute an attractive technique for interactive design of smooth curves, surfaces, and volumes. The user defines an arbitrary number of â\u20ACœcontrol pointsâ\u20AC? on the object and specifies their desired spatial location, while the system computes the object's degrees of freedom so that the constraints are satisfied. A constraint-based interface gives a feeling of direct manipulation of the object. In this article we introduce soft constraints, constraints which do not have to be met exactly. The softness of each constraint serves as a nonisotropic, local shape parameter enabling the user to explore the space of objects conforming to the constraints. Additionally, there is a global shape parameter which determines the amount of similarity of the designed object to a rest shape, or equivalently, the rigidity of the rest shape.We present an algorithm termed probabilistic point constraints (PPC) for implementing soft constraints. The PPC algorithm views constraints as stochastic measurements of the state of a static system. The softness of a constraint is derived from the covariance of the â\u20ACœmeasurement.â\u20AC? The resulting system of probabilistic equations is solved using the Kalman filter, a powerful estimation tool in the theory of stochastic systems. We also describe a user interface using direct-manipulation devices for specifying and visualizing covariances in 2D and 3D.The algorithm is suitable for any object represented as a parametric blend of control points, including most spline representations. The covariance of a constraint provides a continuous transition from exact interpolation to controlled approximation of the constraint. The algorithm involves only linear operations and allows real-time interactive direct manipulation of curves and surfaces on current workstations."}
