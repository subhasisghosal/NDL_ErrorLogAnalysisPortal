In this paper, we effectively apply this fact to design a contrast-enhancement method for images that improves the local image contrast by controlling the local image gradient with a single parameter. Unlike previous methods, we achieve this without explicit segmentation of the image, either in the spatial (multiscale) or frequency (multiresolution) domain. We pose the contrast enhancement as an optimization problem that maximizes the average local contrast of an image strictly constrained by a perceptual constraint derived directly from the Weber Law. We then propose a greedy heuristic, controlled by a single parameter, to approximate this optimization problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23755","fieldValue":" We trace the process of developing and implementing a materials management system in one company over a 15-year period. Using a process research model developed by Newman and Robey, we identify 44 events in the process and define them as either encounters or episodes. Encounters are concentrated events, such as meetings and announcements, that separate episodes, which are events of longer duration. By examining the sequence of events over the 15 years of the case, we identify a pattern of repeated failure, followed by success. Our discussion centers on the value of detecting and displaying such patterns and the need for theoretical interpretation of recurring sequences of events. Five alternative theoretical perspectives, originally proposed by Kling, are used to interpret the sequential patterns identified by the model. We conclude that the form of the process model allows researchers who operate from different perspectives to enrich their understanding of the process of system development."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23755","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23755","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23756","fieldValue":" We give a comprehensive report on our experiments with retrieval from OCR-generated text using systems based on standard models of retrieval. More specifically, we show that average precision and recall is not affected by OCR errors across systems for several collections. The collections used in these experiments include both actual OCR-generated text and standard information retrieval collections corrupted through the simulation of OCR errors. Both the actual and simulation experiments include full-text and abstract-length documents. We also demonstrate that the ranking and feedback methods associated with these models are generally not robust enough to deal with OCR errors. It is further shown that the OCR errors and garbage strings generated from the mistranslation of graphic objects increase the size of the index by a wide margin. We not only point out problems that can arise from applying OCR text within an information retrieval environment, we also suggest solutions to overcome some of these problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23756","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23756","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23757","fieldValue":" We describe an improvement on Ukkonen's Enhanced Dynamic Programming (EHD) approximate string-matching algorithm for unit-penalty four-edit comparisons. The new algorithm has an asymptotic complexity similar to that of Ukkonen's but is significantly faster due to a decrease in the number of array cell calculations. A 42% speedup was achieved in an application involving name comparisons. Even greater improvements are possible when comparing longer and more dissimilar strings. Although the speed of the algorithm under consideration is comparable to other fast ASM algorithms, it has greater effectiveness in text-processing applications because it supports all four basic Damerau-type editing operations."}
