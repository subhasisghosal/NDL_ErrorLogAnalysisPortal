It would be desirable for an online document service to perform text retrieval for users, while protecting the privacy of their activities. In this article, we introduce a privacy-preserving, similarity-based text retrieval scheme that (a) prevents the server from accurately reconstructing the term composition of queries and documents, and (b) anonymizes the search results from unauthorized observers. At the same time, our scheme preserves the relevance-ranking of the search server, and enables accounting of the number of documents that each user opens. The effectiveness of the scheme is verified empirically with two real text corpora."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24409","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24410","fieldValue":"Chen, Teh-Chung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24410","fieldValue":" We propose a novel approach for detecting visual similarity between two Web pages. The proposed approach applies Gestalt theory and considers a Web page as a single indivisible entity. The concept of supersignals, as a realization of Gestalt principles, supports our contention that Web pages must be treated as indivisible entities. We objectify, and directly compare, these indivisible supersignals using algorithmic complexity theory. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the problem of detecting phishing scams. Via a large-scale, real-world case study, we demonstrate that 1) our approach effectively detects similar Web pages; and 2) it accuractely distinguishes legitimate and phishing pages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24411","fieldValue":" Many anti-phishing mechanisms currently focus on helping users verify whether a Web site is genuine. However, usability studies have demonstrated that prevention-based approaches alone fail to effectively suppress phishing attacks and protect Internet users from revealing their credentials to phishing sites. In this paper, instead of preventing human users from â\u20ACœbiting the bait,â\u20AC? we propose a new approach to protect against phishing attacks with â\u20ACœbogus bites.â\u20AC? We develop BogusBiter, a unique client-side anti-phishing tool, which transparently feeds a relatively large number of bogus credentials into a suspected phishing site. BogusBiter conceals a victim's real credential among bogus credentials, and moreover, it enables a legitimate Web site to identify stolen credentials in a timely manner. Leveraging the power of client-side automatic phishing detection techniques, BogusBiter is complementary to existing preventive anti-phishing approaches. We implemented BogusBiter as an extension to the Firefox 2 Web browser, and evaluated its efficacy through real experiments on both phishing and legitimate Web sites. Our experimental results indicate that it is promising to use BogusBiter to transparently protect against phishing attacks."}
