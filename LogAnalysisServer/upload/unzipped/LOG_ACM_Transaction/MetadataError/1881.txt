We present a solution inspired by natural image matting and texture synthesis to the material matting problem, which allows separating a measured spatially-varying material into simpler foreground and background component materials and a corresponding opacity map. We approach this problem in the context of Bayesian statistics and introduce a new prior on materials that favors those with highly self-similar stochastic structure. We describe a prototype system that iteratively performs these separations based on small sets of user scribbles and demonstrate multiple separations and edits."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16542","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16542","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16543","fieldValue":" We present the first physically-based interactive system to facilitate the appearance design at different scales consistently, through manipulations of both small-scale geometry and materials. The core of our system is a novel reflectance filtering algorithm, which rapidly computes the large-scale appearance from small-scale details, by exploiting the low-rank structures of the Bidirectional Visible Normal Distribution Function and pre-rotated BRDFs in the matrix formulation of our rendering problem. Our algorithm is three orders of magnitude faster than a ground-truth method. We demonstrate various editing results of different small-scale geometry with analytical and measured BRDFs. In addition, we show the applications of our system to physical realization of appearance, as well as modeling of real-world materials using very sparse measurements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16543","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16543","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16544","fieldValue":" We present AppGen, an interactive system for modeling materials from a single image. Given a texture image of a nearly planar surface lit with directional lighting, our system models the detailed spatially-varying reflectance properties (diffuse, specular and roughness) and surface normal variations with minimal user interaction. We ask users to indicate global shading and reflectance information by roughly marking the image with a few user strokes, while our system assigns reflectance properties and normals to each pixel. We first interactively decompose the input image into the product of a diffuse albedo map and a shading map. A two-scale normal reconstruction algorithm is then introduced to recover the normal variations from the shading map and preserve the geometric features at different scales. We finally assign the specular parameters to each pixel guided by user strokes and the diffuse albedo. Our system generates convincing results within minutes of interaction and works well for a variety of material types that exhibit different reflectance and normal variations, including natural surfaces and man-made ones."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16544","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16544","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16545","fieldValue":" We propose a method for retargeting measured materials, where a source measured material is edited by applying the reflectance functions of a template measured dataset. The resulting dataset is a material that maintains the spatial patterns of the source dataset, while exhibiting the reflectance behaviors of the template. Compared to editing materials by subsequent selections and modifications, retargeting shortens the time required to achieve a desired look by directly using template data, just as color transfer does for editing images. With our method, users have to just mark corresponding regions of source and template with rough strokes, with no need for further input. This paper introduces AppWarp, an algorithm that achieves retargeting as a user-constrained, appearance-space warping operation, that executes in tens of seconds. Our algorithm is independent of the measured material representation and supports retargeting of analytic and tabulated BRDFs as well as BSSRDFs. In addition, our method makes no assumption of the data distribution in appearance-space nor on the underlying correspondence between source and target. These characteristics make AppWarp the first general formulation for appearance retargeting. We validate our method on several types of materials, including leaves, metals, waxes, woods and greeting cards. Furthermore, we demonstrate how retargeting can be used to enhance diffuse texture with high quality reflectance."}
