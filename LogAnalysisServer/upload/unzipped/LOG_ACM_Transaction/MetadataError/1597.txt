We derive both lower and upper bounds for online algorithms solving these problems. We show that the greedy algorithm is optimal among online algorithms for the chairman assignment problem and the generalized carpool problem. We also consider geometric versions of these problems and show how the bounds adapt to these cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2500","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2500","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15823","fieldValue":"Moreno-Noguer, Francesc"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15823","fieldValue":" We present a system for refocusing images and videos of dynamic scenes using a novel, single-view depth estimation method. Our method for obtaining depth is based on the defocus of a sparse set of dots projected onto the scene. In contrast to other active illumination techniques, the projected pattern of dots can be removed from each captured image and its brightness easily controlled in order to avoid under- or over-exposure. The depths corresponding to the projected dots and a color segmentation of the image are used to compute an approximate depth map of the scene with clean region boundaries. The depth map is used to refocus the acquired image after the dots are removed, simulating realistic depth of field effects. Experiments on a wide variety of scenes, including close-ups and live action, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15823","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15823","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15824","fieldValue":" The emergent field of computational photography is proving that, by coupling generalized imaging optics with software processing, the quality and flexibility of imaging systems can be increased. In this paper, we capture and manipulate multiple images of a scene taken with different aperture settings (f-numbers). We design and implement a prototype optical system and associated algorithms to capture four images of the scene in a single exposure, each taken with a different aperture setting. Our system can be used with commercially available DSLR cameras and photographic lenses without modification to either. We leverage the fact that defocus blur is a function of scene depth and f\/# to estimate a depth map. We demonstrate several applications of our multi-aperture camera, such as post-exposure editing of the depth of field, including extrapolation beyond the physical limits of the lens, synthetic refocusing, and depth-guided deconvolution."}
