Context information has several qualities that make the development of these services challenging, compared to conventional, Web services. Therefore, sound software engineering practices are needed during their development and execution. This article discusses a novel software engineering-based approach, which leverages the benefits of model-driven architecture, aspect-oriented modeling, and formal model checking, for modeling and verifying context-aware services. The approach is explored using a real-world case study in intelligent transport. An evaluation framework is established to validate the main methods and tools employed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24431","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24431","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24432","fieldValue":" Social trust and recommendation services are the most popular social rating systems today for service providers to learn about the social opinion or popularity of a product, item, or service, such as a book on Amazon, a seller on eBay, a story on Digg or a movie on Netflix. Such social rating systems are very convenient and offer alternative learning environments for decision makers, but they open the door for attackers to manipulate the social rating systems by selfishly promoting or maliciously demoting certain items. Although a fair amount of effort has been made to understand various risks and possible defense mechanisms to counter such attacks, most of the existing work to date has been devoted to studying specific types of attacks and their countermeasures. In this article, we argue that vulnerabilities in social rating systems and their countermeasures should be examined and analyzed in a systematic manner. We first give an overview of the common vulnerabilities and attacks observed in some popular social rating services. Next, we describe three types of attack strategies in two types of social rating systems, including a comprehensive theoretical analysis of their attack effectiveness and attack costs. Three context-aware countermeasures are then presented: (i) hiding user-item relationships, (ii) using confidence weight to distinguish popular and unpopular items, and (iii) incorporating time windows in trust establishment. We also provide an in-depth discussion on how these countermeasures can be used effectively to improve the robustness and trustworthiness of the social rating services."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24432","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24432","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24433","fieldValue":" This article proposes a new concept for a context-aware Web search method that automatically retrieves a webpage related to the daily activity that a user currently is engaged in and displays the page on nearby Internet-connected home appliances such as televisions. For example, when a user is washing a coffeemaker, a webpage is retrieved that includes tips such as â\u20ACœcleaning a coffee maker with vinegar removes stains well,â\u20AC? and the page is displayed on a nearby appliance. In this article, we design and implement a Web search method that employs ubiquitous sensors to monitor a user's daily life. Our proposed method automatically searches for a webpage related to a daily activity by using a query constructed from the use of daily objects employed in the activity that is detected with object-attached sensors. We evaluate the search method with real datasets collected from vast numbers of sensors and achieve very accurate webpage retrieval. We then investigate the usefulness and effectiveness of a daily life Web search with Wizard-of-Oz (WOz)-like experiments. We confirm that the presentation of webpages related to daily activities improves participants' future daily lives and triggers communication among the participants in the experiment."}
