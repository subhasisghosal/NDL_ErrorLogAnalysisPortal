They are used in computer graphics, solid modeling, and visualization for applications ranging from the computation of similarities and finding defects in complex models to the automatic selection of visualization parameters. We introduce an on-line algorithm that reads a stream of elements (vertices, triangles, tetrahedra, etc.) and continuously maintains the Reeb graph of all elements already reed. The algorithm is robust in handling non-manifold meshes and general in its applicability to input models of any dimension. Optionally, we construct a skeleton-like embedding of the Reeb graph, and\/or remove topological noise to reduce the output size. For interactive multi-resolution navigation we also build a hierarchical data structure which allows real-time extraction of approximated Reeb graphs containing all topological features above a given error threshold. Our extensive experiments show both high performance and practical linear scalability for meshes ranging from thousands to hundreds of millions of triangles. We apply our algorithm to the largest, most general, triangulated surfaces available to us, including 3D, 4D and 5D simplicial meshes. To demonstrate one important application we use Reeb graphs to find and highlight topological defects in meshes, including some widely believed to be \"clean.\""}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15814","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15814","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15815","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15815","fieldValue":" We present a new method for real-time rendering of sophisticated lighting effects in and around refractive objects. It enables us to realistically display refractive objects with complex material properties, such as arbitrarily varying refractive index, inhomogeneous attenuation, as well as spatially-varying anisotropic scattering and reflectance properties. User-controlled changes of lighting positions only require a few seconds of update time. Our method is based on a set of ordinary differential equations derived from the eikonal equation, the main postulate of geometric optics. This set of equations allows for fast casting of bent light rays with the complexity of a particle tracer. Based on this concept, we also propose an efficient light propagation technique using adaptive wavefront tracing. Efficient GPU implementations for our algorithmic concepts enable us to render a combination of visual effects that were previously not reproducible in real-time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15815","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15815","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15816","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a theoretical model for computing the scattering properties of participating media and translucent materials. The model takes as input a description of the components of a medium and computes all the parameters necessary to render it. These parameters are the extinction and scattering coefficients, the phase function, and the index of refraction, Our theory is based on a robust generalization of the Lorenz-Mie theory. Previous models using Lorenz-Mie theory have been limited to non-absorbing media with spherical particles such as paints and clouds. Our generalized theory is capable of handling both absorbing host media and non-spherical particles, which significantly extends the classes of media and materials that can be modeled. We use the theory to computer optical properties for different types of ice and ocean water, and we derive a novel appearance model for milk parameterized by the fat and protein contents. Our results show that we are able to match measured scattering properties in cases where the classical Lorez-Mie theory breaks down, and we can compute properties for media that cannot be measured using existing techniques in computer graphics."}
