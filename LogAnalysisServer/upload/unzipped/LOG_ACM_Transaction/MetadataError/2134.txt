The $L_∞-norm ensures the tightest possible control on the worst-case distortion. Unfortunately, it does not yield a unique solution and does not distinguish between solutions with high or low distortion below the maximum. The strict minimizer is a minimal L∞-norm solution, which always prioritizes higher distortion reduction. We propose practical algorithms for computing strict minimizers. We also offer an efficient algorithm for L∞$ optimization based on the ARAP energy. This algorithm can be used on its own or as a building block for an ARAP strict minimizer. We demonstrate that these algorithms lead to significant improvements in quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17188","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17188","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17189","fieldValue":" We present fast algorithms to perform accurate CCD queries between triangulated models.

Our approach identifies the geometric and spatial constraints among the different parts of an object, and makes this information available through abstract shape handles. These handles allow the user to prescribe arbitrary deformation directives including free-form surface deformations. However, only a subset of admissible deformations is enabled to the user as learned from the constraint space. Example applications are presented in shape editing, co-deformation and style transfer."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17190","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17190","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17191","fieldValue":" Barycentric coordinates yield a powerful and yet simple paradigm to interpolate data values on polyhedral domains. They represent interior points of the domain as an affine combination of a set of control points, defining an interpolation scheme for any function defined on a set of control points. Numerous barycentric coordinate schemes have been proposed satisfying a large variety of properties. However, they typically define interpolation as a combination of all control points. Thus a local change in the value at a single control point will create a global change by propagation into the whole domain. In this context, we present a family of local barycentric coordinates (LBC), which select for each interior point a small set of control points and satisfy common requirements on barycentric coordinates, such as linearity, non-negativity, and smoothness. LBC are achieved through a convex optimization based on total variation, and provide a compact representation that reduces memory footprint and allows for fast deformations. Our experiments show that LBC provide more local and finer control on shape deformation than previous approaches, and lead to more intuitive deformation results."}
