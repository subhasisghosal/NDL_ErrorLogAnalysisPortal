Let P be a graph property, a graph G = (V, E) with n vertices is said to have an inductive neighborhood property with respect to P if there is an ordering of vertices $v_1, &dots;, vn such that the property P holds on the induced subgraph G[N(vi)∩ Vi], where N(vi) is the neighborhood of vi and Vi = {vi, &dots;, vn$}. It turns out that if we take P as a graph with maximum independent set size no greater than k, then this definition gives a natural generalization of both chordal graphs and (k + 1)-claw-free graphs. We refer to such graphs as inductive k-independent graphs. We study properties of such families of graphs, and we show that several natural classes of graphs are inductive k-independent for small k. In particular, any intersection graph of translates of a convex object in a two dimensional plane is an inductive 3-independent graph; furthermore, any planar graph is an inductive 3-independent graph. For any fixed constant k, we develop simple, polynomial time approximation algorithms for inductive k-independent graphs with respect to several well-studied NP-complete problems. Our generalized formulation unifies and extends several previously known results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2531","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2531","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16152","fieldValue":" We propose an automatic approach to generate street-side 3D photo-realistic models from images captured along the streets at ground level. We first develop a multi-view semantic segmentation method that recognizes and segments each image at pixel level into semantically meaningful areas, each labeled with a specific object class, such as building, sky, ground, vegetation and car. A partition scheme is then introduced to separate buildings into independent blocks using the major line structures of the scene. Finally, for each block, we propose an inverse patch-based orthographic composition and structure analysis method for façade modeling that efficiently regularizes the noisy and missing reconstructed 3D data. Our system has the distinct advantage of producing visually compelling results by imposing strong priors of building regularity. We demonstrate the fully automatic system on a typical city example to validate our methodology."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/16152","fieldValue":"Fa&ccedil;ade modeling"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16152","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16152","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16153","fieldValue":" Raster image vectorization is increasingly important since vector-based graphical contents have been adopted in personal computers and on the Internet. In this paper, we introduce an effective vector-based representation and its associated vectorization algorithm for full-color raster images. There are two important characteristics of our representation. First, the image plane is decomposed into nonoverlapping parametric triangular patches with curved boundaries. Such a simplicial layout supports a flexible topology and facilitates adaptive patch distribution. Second, a subset of the curved patch boundaries are dedicated to faithfully representing curvilinear features. They are automatically aligned with the features. Because of this, patches are expected to have moderate internal variations that can be well approximated using smooth functions. We have developed effective techniques for patch boundary optimization and patch color fitting to accurately and compactly approximate raster images with both smooth variations and curvilinear features. A real-time GPU-accelerated parallel algorithm based on recursive patch subdivision has also been developed for rasterizing a vectorized image. Experiments and comparisons indicate our image vectorization algorithm achieves a more accurate and compact vector-based representation than existing ones do."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16153","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16153","fieldValue":"ACM"}
