That is, when the puzzle is assembled, all the pieces are notched except one single key component which remains mobile. The intriguing property of the assembled burr puzzle is that it is stable, perfectly interlocked, without glue or screws, etc. Moreover, a burr puzzle consisting of a small number of pieces is still rather difficult to solve since the assembly must follow certain orders while the combinatorial complexity of the puzzle's piece arrangements is extremely high. In this paper, we generalize the 6-piece orthogonal burr puzzle (a knot) to design and model burr puzzles from 3D models. Given a 3D input model, we first interactively embed a network of knots into the 3D shape. Our method automatically optimizes and arranges the orientation of each knot, and modifies pieces of adjacent knots with an appropriate connection type. Then, following the geometry of the embedded pieces, the entire 3D model is partitioned by splitting the solid while respecting the assembly motion of embedded pieces. The main technical challenge is to enforce the single-key property and ensure the assembly\/disassembly remains feasible, as the puzzle pieces in a network of knots are highly interlocked. Lastly, we also present an automated approach to generate the visualizations of the puzzle assembly process."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16496","fieldValue":"Li, Xian-Ying"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16496","fieldValue":"Hu, Shi-Min"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16496","fieldValue":" Pop-up books are a fascinating form of paper art with intriguing geometric properties. In this paper, we present a systematic study of a simple but common class of pop-ups consisting of patches falling into four parallel groups, which we call v-style pop-ups. We give sufficient conditions for a v-style paper structure to be pop-uppable. That is, it can be closed flat while maintaining the rigidity of the patches, the closing and opening do not need extra force besides holding two patches and are free of intersections, and the closed paper is contained within the page border. These conditions allow us to identify novel mechanisms for making pop-ups. Based on the theory and mechanisms, we developed an interactive tool for designing v-style pop-ups and an automated construction algorithm from a given geometry, both of which guaranteeing the pop-uppability of the results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16497","fieldValue":" We describe a novel algorithm for extracting a resolution-independent vector representation from pixel art images, which enables magnifying the results by an arbitrary amount without image degradation. Our algorithm resolves pixel-scale features in the input and converts them into regions with smoothly varying shading that are crisply separated by piecewise-smooth contour curves. In the original image, pixels are represented on a square pixel lattice, where diagonal neighbors are only connected through a single point. This causes thin features to become visually disconnected under magnification by conventional means, and creates ambiguities in the connectedness and separation of diagonal neighbors. The key to our algorithm is in resolving these ambiguities. This enables us to reshape the pixel cells so that neighboring pixels belonging to the same feature are connected through edges, thereby preserving the feature connectivity under magnification. We reduce pixel aliasing artifacts and improve smoothness by fitting spline curves to contours in the image and optimizing their control points."}
