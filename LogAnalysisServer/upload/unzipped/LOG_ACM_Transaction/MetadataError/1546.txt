We show that meshes that conform well to changing boundaries and that focus computation in the visually important parts of the domain can be generated quickly and reliably using existing techniques. We also describe a new approach to two-way coupling of fluid and rigid bodies that, while general, benefits from remeshing. Overall, the method provides a flexible environment for creating complex scenes involving fluid animation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15688","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15688","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15689","fieldValue":" We present a new model reduction approach to fluid simulation, enabling large, real-time, detailed flows with continuous user interaction. Our reduced model can also handle moving obstacles immersed in the flow. We create separate models for the velocity field and for each moving boundary, and show that the coupling forces may be reduced as well. Our results indicate that surprisingly few basis functions are needed to resolve small but visually important features such as spinning vortices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15690","fieldValue":" We present a system for interactively browsing and exploring large unstructured collections of photographs of a scene using a novel 3D interface. Our system consists of an image-based modeling front end that automatically computes the viewpoint of each photograph as well as a sparse 3D model of the scene and image to model correspondences. Our photo explorer uses image-based rendering techniques to smoothly transition between photographs, while also enabling full 3D navigation and exploration of the set of images and world geometry, along with auxiliary information such as overhead maps. Our system also makes it easy to construct photo tours of scenic or historic locations, and to annotate image details, which are automatically transferred to other relevant images. We demonstrate our system on several large personal photo collections as well as images gathered from Internet photo sharing sites."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15690","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15691","fieldValue":" The paper defines an automatic procedure for constructing a visually appealing collage from a collection of input images. The aim is that the resulting collage should be representative of the collection, summarising its main themes. It is also assembled largely seamlessly, using graph-cut, Poisson blending of alpha-masks, to hide the joins between input images. This paper makes several new contributions. Firstly, we show how energy terms can be included that: encourage the selection of a representative set of images; that are sensitive to particular object classes; that encourage a spatially efficient and seamless layout. Secondly the resulting optimization poses a search problem that, on the face of it, is computationally in-feasible. Rather than attempt an expensive, integrated optimization procedure, we have developed a sequence of optimization steps, from static ranking of images, through region of interest optimization, optimal packing by constraint satisfaction, and lastly graph-cut alpha-expansion. To illustrate the power of AutoCollage, we have used it to create collages of many home photo sets; we also conducted a user study in which AutoCollage outperformed competitive methods."}
