Restricting the access to group data can be reduced to the problem of securely distributing cryptographic keys to group members, known as the key distribution problem (KDP). We examine the KDP under four metrics: (a) member key storage, (b) group controller (GC) transmissions, (c) multicast group (MG) update messages, and (d) average update energy. For each metric, we formulate an optimization problem and show that the KDP has unique solutions for metrics (a) and (b), while is NP-complete for (c) and (d). We propose a cross-layer heuristic algorithm called VP3 that bounds member key storage, and GC transmissions, while significantly reducing the energy and bandwidth consumption of the network. We define the notion of path divergence as a measure of bandwidth efficiency of multicasting, and establish an analytical worst-case bound for it. Finally, we propose On-line VP3, which dynamically updates the key assignment structure according to the dynamics of the communication group in a resource-efficient way."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9689","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9689","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9690","fieldValue":" In this paper we consider packet networks loaded by admissible traffic patterns, i.e., by traffic patterns that, if optimally routed, do not overload network resources. We prove that simple distributed dynamic routing and scheduling algorithms based upon link state information can achieve the same network throughput as optimal centralized routing and scheduling algorithms with complete traffic information. Our proofs apply the stochastic Lyapunov function methodology to a flow-level abstract model of the network, and consider elastic traffic, i.e., we assume that flows can adapt their transmission rates to network conditions, thus resembling traffic engineering and quality-of-service approaches being currently proposed for IP networks. Although the paper mainly brings a theoretical contribution, such dynamic routing and scheduling algorithms can be implemented in a distributed way. Moreover we prove that maximum throughput is achieved also in case of temporary mismatches between the actual links state and the link state information used by the routing algorithm. This is a particularly relevant aspect, since any distributed implementation of a routing algorithm requires a periodic exchange of link state information among nodes, and this implies delays, and thus time periods in which the current link costs are not known."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9690","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9690","fieldValue":"ACM"}
