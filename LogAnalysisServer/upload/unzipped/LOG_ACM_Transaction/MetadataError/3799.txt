The severe resource constraints in each sensor make it very challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover, sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments and hence are susceptible to various attacks, including node capture, physical tampering, and manipulation of the sensor program. Park and Shin [2005] proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor device, called the program integrity verification (PIV), in which sensors authenticate PIV servers (PIVSs) using centralized and trusted third-party entities, such as authentication servers (ASs). This article presents a distributed authentication protocol of PIVSs (DAPP) without requiring the commonly used ASs. DAPP uses the Blundo scheme [Blundo et al. 1992] for sensors and PIVSs to establish pairwise keys and for PIVSs to authenticate one another. We also present a protocol for PIVSs to cooperatively detect and revoke malicious PIVSs in the network. We implement and evaluate both DAPP and PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops, showing that DAPP reduces the sensors' communication traffic in the network by more than 90&percnt; and the energy consumption on each sensor by up to 85&percnt;, as compared to the case of using a centralized AS for authenticating PIVSs. We also analyze the security of DAPP under various attack models, demonstrating its capability in dealing with diverse types of attacks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22246","fieldValue":" Overlay multicast networks are used by service providers to distribute contents such as Web pages, static and streaming multimedia data, or security updates to a large number of users. However, such networks are extremely vulnerable to message-dropping attacks by malicious or selfish nodes that intentionally drop the packets they are required to forward to others. It is difficult to detect such attacks both efficiently and effectively and to further identify the attackers, especially when members in the overlay switch between online\/offline statuses frequently. In this article, we consider various attacking strategies of an attacker and propose an optimal sampling-based scheme to detect such attacks in the overlay network. We analyze the detection problem from a game-theoretical viewpoint and show that our scheme outperforms a random sampling-based scheme in terms of detection rate. In addition, based on a reputation system, we propose a sampling-based path-resolving scheme to identify compromised or selfish nodes. Unlike other existing approaches, our schemes do not assume global knowledge of the overlay hierarchy and work for dynamic overlay networks as well. Extensive analysis and simulation results show that besides being band width efficient, our schemes have high detection and identification rates and low false-positive rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22247","fieldValue":"McDaniel, Patrick"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22247","fieldValue":" Determining whether a user or system is exercising appropriate security practices is difficult in any context. Such difficulties are particularly pronounced when uncontrolled or unknown platforms join public networks. Commonly practiced techniques used to vet these hosts, such as system scans, have the potential to infringe on the privacy of users. In this article, we show that it is possible for clients to prove both the presence and proper functioning of security infrastructure without allowing unrestricted access to their system. We demonstrate this approach, specifically applied to antivirus security, by requiring clients seeking admission to a network to positively identify the presence or absence of malcode in a series of puzzles. The implementation of this mechanism and its application to real networks are also explored. In so doing, we demonstrate that it is not necessary for an administrator to be invasive to determine whether a client implements required security practices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22247","fieldValue":"ACM"}
