To enable access for visually impaired users, most Web sites utilize audio CAPTCHAs in addition to a conventional image-based scheme. Recent research has shown that most currently available audio CAPTCHAs are insecure, as they can be broken by means of machine learning at relatively low costs. Moreover, most audio CAPTCHAs suffer from low human success rates that arise from severe signal distortions. This article proposes two different audio CAPTCHA schemes that systematically exploit differences between humans and computers in terms of auditory perception and language understanding, yielding a better trade-off between usability and security as compared to currently available schemes. Furthermore, we provide an elaborate analysis of Googleâ\u20AC™s prominent reCAPTCHA that serves as a baseline setting when evaluating our proposed CAPTCHA designs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20839","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20839","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20840","fieldValue":" The mainstream approach to protecting the privacy of mobile users in location-based services (LBSs) is to alter (e.g., perturb, hide, and so on) the usersâ\u20AC™ actual locations in order to reduce exposed sensitive information. In order to be effective, a location-privacy preserving mechanism must consider both the privacy and utility requirements of each user, as well as the userâ\u20AC™s overall exposed locations (which contribute to the adversaryâ\u20AC™s background knowledge). In this article, we propose a methodology that enables the design of optimal user-centric location obfuscation mechanisms respecting each individual userâ\u20AC™s service quality requirements, while maximizing the expected error that the optimal adversary incurs in reconstructing the userâ\u20AC™s actual trace. A key advantage of a user-centric mechanism is that it does not depend on third-party proxies or anonymizers; thus, it can be directly integrated in the mobile devices that users employ to access LBSs. Our methodology is based on the mutual optimization of user\/adversary objectives (maximizing location privacy versus minimizing localization error) formalized as a Stackelberg Bayesian game. This formalization makes our solution robust against any location inference attack, that is, the adversary cannot decrease the userâ\u20AC™s privacy by designing a better inference algorithm as long as the obfuscation mechanism is designed according to our privacy games. We develop two linear programs that solve the location privacy game and output the optimal obfuscation strategy and its corresponding optimal inference attack. These linear programs are used to design location privacy--preserving mechanisms that consider the correlation between past, current, and future locations of the user, thus can be tuned to protect different privacy objectives along the userâ\u20AC™s location trace. We illustrate the efficacy of the optimal location privacy--preserving mechanisms obtained with our approach against real location traces, showing their performance in protecting usersâ\u20AC™ different location privacy objectives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20840","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20840","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.editor","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20841","fieldValue":"Long, Darrell D E"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/20841","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"12\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20853\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 12\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"11\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20852\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 11\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"10\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20851\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 10\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"9\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20850\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 9\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"8\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20849\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 8\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"7\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20848\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 7\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"6\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20847\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 6\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"5\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20846\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 5\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"4\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20845\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 4\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"3\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20844\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 3\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"2\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20843\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 2\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"1\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20842\",\"title\":\"ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS) : Volume 1\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/20842","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"November 2005\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20857\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, November 2005\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"August 2005\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20856\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, August 2005\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"May 2005\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20855\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, May 2005\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"February 2005\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/20854\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, February 2005\"}]"}
