We give details on power series, asymptotic series, recursion and quadrature. A combination of these methods can be used for computing parabolic cylinder functions for unrestricted values of the order a and the variable x except for the overflow\/underflow limitations. By factoring the dominant exponential factor, scaled functions can be computed without practical overflow\/underflow limitations. In an accompanying article we describe the precise domains for these methods and we present the Fortran 90 codes for the computation of these functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19125","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19125","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19126","fieldValue":" Fortran 90 programs for the computation of real parabolic cylinder functions are presented. The code computes the functions U(a, x), V(a, x) and their derivatives for real a and x (x â\u2030¥ 0). The code also computes scaled functions. The range of computation for scaled PCFs is practically unrestricted. The aimed relative accuracy for scaled functions is better than 5 $10^âˆ\u201914. Exceptions to this accuracy are the evaluation of the functions near their zeros and the error caused by the evaluation of trigonometric functions of large arguments when &verbar;a&verbar; &Gt; x. The routines always give values for which the Wronskian relation for scaled functions is verified with a relative accuracy better than 5 10âˆ\u201914. The accuracy of the unscaled functions is also better than 5 10âˆ\u201914 for moderate values of x and a (except close to the zeros), while for large x and a the error is dominated by exponential and trigonometric function evaluations. For IEEE standard double precision arithmetic, the accuracy is better than 5 10âˆ\u201913$ in the computable range of unscaled PCFs (except close to the zeros)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19127","fieldValue":" Recently, a new nonlinear conjugate gradient scheme was developed which satisfies the descent condition $$g^Tkd_k â\u2030¤ âˆ\u20197\/8 &Verbar;gk$&Verbar;2$ and which is globally convergent whenever the line search fulfills the Wolfe conditions.

Reliable approximations of continuous or discrete solution sets are computed using Cartesian products of intervals. Systems are given by sets of equations or inequality constraints over integer and real variables. Moreover, they may have different natures, being square or nonsquare, sparse or dense, linear, polynomial, or involving transcendental functions.The modeling language permits stating constraint models and tuning parameters of solving algorithms which efficiently combine interval methods and constraint satisfaction techniques. Several consistency techniques (box, hull, and 3B) are implemented. The distribution includes C sources, executables for different machine architectures, documentation, and benchmarks. The portability is ensured by the GNU C compiler."}
