Auctions are believed to be among the most effective tools to solve this problem. A great number of strategy-proof auction mechanisms have been proposed to improve spectrum allocation efficiency by stimulating bidders to truthfully reveal their valuations of spectrum, which are the private information of bidders. However, none of these approaches protects bidders' privacy. In this paper, we present PRIDE, which is a PRIvacy-preserving anD stratEgy-proof spectrum auction mechanism. PRIDE guarantees k-anonymity for both single- and multiple-channel auctions. Furthermore, we enhance PRIDE to provide l-diversity, which is an even stronger privacy protection than k-anonymity. We not only rigorously prove the economic and privacy-preserving properties of PRIDE, but also extensively evaluate its performance. Our evaluation results show that PRIDE achieves good spectrum redistribution efficiency and fairness with low overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10791","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10791","fieldValue":"Towards privacy preservation in strategy-proof spectrum auction mechanisms for noncooperative wireless networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10792","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study the channel allocation problem in cognitive radio wireless mesh networks (CR-WMNs). We aim at finding an allocation strategy that guarantees quality of service (QoS) (link reliability), maximizes network coverage, and alleviates the need for a common control channel to coordinate the communication process. The allocation of a particular channel to a mesh client (MC) is considered feasible if the MC can establish connectivity with the backbone network in both the upstream and the downstream directions, and has the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the uplink and the downlink with its parent mesh router (MR) within a predetermined threshold. A receiver-based channel allocation (RBA) model that achieves the aforementioned objectives is proposed (channel assignment under this model can be proven to be NP-hard). We then formulate a mixed integer linear program, of the channel allocation problem under the proposed model, and compare its performance to that of two other baseline models, namely, transmitter-based and all-tunable channel allocation strategies. The results prove the superiority of the proposed model. We also developed a heuristic algorithm, which is shown to be an accurate algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10792","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10792","fieldValue":"ACM"}
