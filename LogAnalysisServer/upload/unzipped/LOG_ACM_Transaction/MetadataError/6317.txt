In this article we focus on this embedded system. To accelerate the image reconstruction, the Beamforming phase has to be implemented in a parallel fashion. We assess its implementation in three currently available high-end platforms based on a multicore CPU, a GPU, and an FPGA, respectively. We then project the results applying technology scaling rules to future many-core CPUs, many-thread GPUs, and advanced FPGAs. We consider an optimistic case in which available resources increase according to Moore's law only, and a pessimistic case in which only a fraction of those resources are available due to a limited power budget. In both scenarios, an implementation that includes a high-end FPGA outperforms the other alternatives. Since the number of effectively usable cores in future many-cores will be power-limited, and there is a trend toward the integration of power-efficient accelerators, we conjecture that a chip consisting of a many-core section and a reconfigurable logic section will be the perfect platform for this application."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6808","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6808","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6809","fieldValue":"ACM"}
