{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23040","fieldValue":" We explore the use of morph-based language models in large-vocabulary continuous-speech recognition systems across four so-called morphologically rich languages: Finnish, Estonian, Turkish, and Egyptian Colloquial Arabic. The morphs are subword units discovered in an unsupervised, data-driven way using the Morfessor algorithm. By estimating n-gram language models over sequences of morphs instead of words, the quality of the language model is improved through better vocabulary coverage and reduced data sparsity. Standard word models suffer from high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates, whereas the morph models can recognize previously unseen word forms by concatenating morphs. It is shown that the morph models do perform fairly well on OOVs without compromising the recognition accuracy on in-vocabulary words. The Arabic experiment constitutes the only exception since here the standard word model outperforms the morph model. Differences in the datasets and the amount of data are discussed as a plausible explanation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/23040","fieldValue":"<i>n<\/i>-gram models"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23040","fieldValue":"<i>n<\/i>-gram models"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23040","fieldValue":"LVCSR"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23040","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23040","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3248","fieldValue":" This paper presents a review of the research surrounding the paper â\u20ACœThe Design and Evaluation of a Sonically Enhanced Tool Paletteâ\u20AC? by Brewster and Clarke from ICAD 1997.

However, there are many choices involved in creating a CWS system such as various specifications and CWS methods. The choices made will create a new CWS scheme, but whether it will produce a superior or inferior translation has remained unknown to date. This article examines the relationship between CWS and SMT. The effects of CWS on SMT were investigated using different specifications and CWS methods. Four specifications were selected for investigation: Beijing University (PKU), Hong Kong City University (CITYU), Microsoft Research (MSR), and Academia SINICA (AS). We created 16 CWS schemes under different settings to examine the relationship between CWS and SMT. Our experimental results showed that the MSR's specifications produced the lowest quality translations. In examining the effects of CWS methods, we tested dictionary-based and CRF-based approaches and found there was no significant difference between the two in the quality of the resulting translations. We also found the correlation between the CWS F-score and SMT BLEU score was very weak. We analyzed CWS errors and their effect on SMT by evaluating systems trained with and without these errors. This article also proposes two methods for combining advantages of different specifications: a simple concatenation of training data and a feature interpolation approach in which the same types of features of translation models from various CWS schemes are linearly interpolated. We found these approaches were very effective in improving the quality of translations."}
