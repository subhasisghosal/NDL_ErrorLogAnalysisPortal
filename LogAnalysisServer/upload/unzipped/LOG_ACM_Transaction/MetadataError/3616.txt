Applications partitioned into modules have the potential to exploit this capability to virtualize hardware by swapping modules as required. One of the challenges in doing so is to provide a communication infrastructure that supports the interfaces and communication needs of a sequence of dynamic module swaps. In contrast to previous approaches which have examined the use of buses and networks-on-chip for this purpose, we examine the use of customized point-to-point wiring harnesses to provide the dynamic connections required for dynamic modular reconfiguration in an efficient manner. The COMMA methodology implements applications on tile-reconfigurable FPGAs, such as the Virtex-4, and its design flow is integrated with the early access partial reconfiguration tools from Xilinx. This article outlines the methodology and describes greedy and dynamic programming approaches to merging the communication graphs of successive configurations in order to generate effective wiring harnesses within the methodology. Our evaluation indicates merging can markedly reduce total reconfiguration delays at the cost of increased critical path delays. Application of the technique is likely to be limited to scenarios in which the execution time between reconfigurations is short."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21740","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21740","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21741","fieldValue":"George, Alan D"}
