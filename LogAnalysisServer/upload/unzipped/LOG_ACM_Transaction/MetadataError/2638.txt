The new code utilizes a novel restructuring of the symbolic and numerical phases, which increases speed and saves storage without sacrifice of numerical stability. Other features include switching to full-matrix processing in all phases of the computation enabling the use of all three levels of BLAS, treatment of rectangular or rank-deficient matrices, partial factorization, and integrated facilities for iterative refinement and error estimation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18851","fieldValue":"BLAS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18852","fieldValue":" We describe the design of a new code for the solution of sparse indefinite symmetric linear systems of equations. The principal difference between this new code and earlier work lies in the exploitation of the additional sparsity available when the matrix has a significant number of zero diagonal entries.
