Our approach calculates a dense space-time deformation using grid-based signed-distance functions of the inputs. A key advantage of this implicit Eulerian representation is that it allows us to use powerful techniques from the optical flow area. We employ a five-dimensional optical flow solve. In combination with a projection algorithm, and residual iterations, we achieve a robust matching of the inputs. Once the match is computed, arbitrary in-between variants can be created very efficiently. To concatenate multiple long-range deformations, we propose a novel alignment technique. Our approach has numerous advantages, including automatic matches without user input, volumetric deformations that can be applied to details around the surface, and the inherent handling of topology changes. As a result, we can interpolate swirling smoke clouds, and splashing liquid simulations. We can even match and interpolate phenomena with fundamentally different physics: a drop of liquid, and a blob of heavy smoke."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17749","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17749","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17750","fieldValue":"ik, Martin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17750","fieldValue":" The human visual system is sensitive to relative differences in luminance, but light transport simulation algorithms based on Metropolis sampling often result in a highly nonuniform relative error distribution over the rendered image. Although this issue has previously been addressed in the context of the Metropolis light transport algorithm, our work focuses on Metropolis photon tracing. We present a new target function (TF) for Metropolis photon tracing that ensures good stratification of photons leading to pixel estimates with equalized relative error. We develop a hierarchical scheme for progressive construction of the TF from paths sampled during rendering. In addition to the approach taken in previous work, where the TF is defined in the image plane, ours can be associated with compact spatial regions. This allows us to take advantage of illumination coherence to more robustly estimate the TF while adapting to geometry discontinuities. To sample from this TF, we design a new replica exchange Metropolis scheme. We apply our algorithm in progressive photon mapping and show that it often outperforms alternative approaches in terms of image quality by a large margin.
