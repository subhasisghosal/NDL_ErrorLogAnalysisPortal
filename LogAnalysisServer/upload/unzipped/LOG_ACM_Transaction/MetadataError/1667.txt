Progressive photon mapping is a multi-pass algorithm where the first pass is ray tracing followed by any number of photon tracing passes. Each photon tracing pass results in an increasingly accurate global illumination solution that can be visualized in order to provide progressive feedback. Progressive photon mapping uses a new radiance estimate that converges to the correct radiance value as more photons are used. It is not necessary to store the full photon map, and unlike standard photon mapping it possible to compute a global illumination solution with any desired accuracy using a limited amount of memory. Compared with existing Monte Carlo ray tracing methods progressive photon mapping provides an efficient and robust alternative in the presence of complex light transport such as caustics and in particular reflections of caustics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15998","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15998","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15999","fieldValue":" We describe a unified representation of occluders in light transport and photography using shield fields: the 4D attenuation function which acts on any light field incident on an occluder. Our key theoretical result is that shield fields can be used to decouple the effects of occluders and incident illumination. We first describe the properties of shield fields in the frequency-domain and briefly analyze the \"forward\" problem of efficiently computing cast shadows. Afterwards, we apply the shield field signal-processing framework to make several new observations regarding the \"inverse\" problem of reconstructing 3D occluders from cast shadows -- extending previous work on shape-from-silhouette and visual hull methods. From this analysis we develop the first single-camera, single-shot approach to capture visual hulls without requiring moving or programmable illumination. We analyze several competing camera designs, ultimately leading to the development of a new large-format, mask-based light field camera that exploits optimal tiled-broadband codes for light-efficient shield field capture. We conclude by presenting a detailed experimental analysis of shield field capture and 3D occluder reconstruction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15999","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16000","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16000","fieldValue":" Fluid simulation is one of the most active research areas in computer graphics. However, it remains difficult to obtain measurements of real fluid flows for validation of the simulated data. In this paper, we take a step in the direction of capturing flow data for such purposes. Specifically, we present the first time-resolved Schlieren tomography system for capturing full 3D, non-stationary gas flows on a dense volumetric grid. Schlieren tomography uses 2D ray deflection measurements to reconstruct a time-varying grid of 3D refractive index values, which directly correspond to physical properties of the flow. We derive a new solution for this reconstruction problem that lends itself to efficient algorithms that robustly work with relatively small numbers of cameras. Our physical system is easy to set up, and consists of an array of relatively low cost rolling-shutter camcorders that are synchronized with a new approach. We demonstrate our method with real measurements, and analyze precision with synthetic data for which ground truth information is available."}
