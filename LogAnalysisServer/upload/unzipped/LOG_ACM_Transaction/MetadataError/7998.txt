To accelerate design tuning, statistical design space exploration methods have been proposed. This article presents Starchart, a novel design space partitioning tool that uses regression trees to approach GPU tuning problems. Improving on prior work, Starchart offers more automation in identifying key design trade-offs and models design subspaces with distinctly different behaviors. Starchart achieves good model accuracy using very few random samples: less than 0.3&percnt; of a given design space; iterative sampling can more quickly target subspaces of interest."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1987","fieldValue":"GPGPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1987","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1987","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10814","fieldValue":" We study routing and scheduling algorithms for relay-assisted, multichannel downlink wireless networks [e.g., orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based cellular systems with relays]. Over such networks, while it is well understood that the BackPressure algorithm is stabilizing (i.e., queue lengths do not become arbitrarily large), its performance (e.g., delay, buffer usage) can be poor. In this paper, we study an alternative--the MaxWeight algorithm--variants of which are known to have good performance in a single-hop setting. In a general relay setting, however, MaxWeight is not even stabilizing (and thus can have very poor performance). In this paper, we study an iterative MaxWeight algorithm for routing and scheduling in downlink multichannel relay networks. We show that, surprisingly, the iterative MaxWeight algorithm can stabilize the system in several large-scale instantiations of this setting (e.g., general arrivals with full-duplex relays, bounded arrivals with half-duplex relays). Furthermore, using both many-channel large-deviations analysis and simulations, we show that iterative MaxWeight outperforms the BackPressure algorithm from a queue-length\/delay perspective."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10814","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10814","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10814","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10815","fieldValue":" Connections provisioned in a backbone network are usually protected. A \"good\" protection scheme can decrease the downtime experienced by a connection, which can reduce (or eliminate) penalties for the violation of the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the network operator and its customer. Although \"good\" protection schemes can guarantee high availability to connections, they usually require high capacity (e.g., bandwidth). However, backbone networks usually have some excess capacity (EC) to accommodate traffic fluctuations and growth, and when there is enough EC, the high capacity requirement of protection schemes can be tolerated. However, under traffic growth, the network operator has to add more bandwidth to avoid capacity exhaustion, which increases upgrade costs. In this study, we show that, in case of connections supporting differentiated services, where connections' tolerable downtimes are diverse, efficient exploitation of EC can decrease both SLA violations and upgrade costs. We develop a novel EC management (ECM) approach that provides high-availability high-capacity protection schemes when EC is available, and reprovisions backup resources with multiple protection schemes so that SLAs are still respected, but network upgrade costs are kept under control. We formulate this problem as an integer linear program (ILP) and develop an efficient heuristic as the ILP is intractable for large problems. We present several alternatives of our ECM approach to show its compatibility with different protection-scheme combinations. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate how the proposed ECM technique finds a tradeoff between upgrade costs and penalties paid for SLA violations while reducing the total cost significantly."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10815","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
