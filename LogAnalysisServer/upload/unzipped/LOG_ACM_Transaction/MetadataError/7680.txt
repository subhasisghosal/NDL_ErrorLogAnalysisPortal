{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10170","fieldValue":" Optical backbone networks are becoming increasingly intelligent and flexible. These networks are able to establish high-bandwidth wavelength connections on-demand to support future network-centric applications. Choosing an efficient path in a timely manner, while considering important criteria such as operation costs and network performance, is a key problem confronting the network operators. Subtle path preferences of different dynamic routing algorithms (which are usually ignored by traditional analysis techniques) can make a significant difference in performance on mesh networks. It opens new research to advance routing algorithms in both analysis and implementation paradigms. In this paper, we propose an opportunity cost model that provides fast and accurate analysis for threshold-based online congestion-aware routing algorithms. The model is simple to compute, robust to different network topologies, and scalable. We show that our model further aids in the design of a number of new routing algorithms that can be easily applied to practical networks. In contrast to previous work, the optimal threshold values for our algorithms can be identified analytically, and the values sustain good performance on different network topologies and sizes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10170","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10170","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10170","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10171","fieldValue":" Community wireless networks (CWNs) have been proposed to spread broadband network access to underprivileged, underprovisioned, and remote areas. Research has focused on optimizing network performance through intelligent routing and scheduling, borrowing solutions from mesh networks. Surprisingly, however, there has been no work on how to make efficient use of multiple channels in CWNs in the presence of multiple gateways and a single radio per device. In fact, today's deployments in underprivileged areas are primarily single-radio and do operate on a single channel. Frequency selection in such CWNs is very complex because it does not only determine the nodes' channel of operation, but also the gateway and the routing tree to the gateway--a rather computationally intensive task. In this paper, we propose, design, implement, and evaluate SWARM, a practical system that allows a CWN to make effective use of the available wireless channels in order to offer globally optimal performance. SWARM improves performance versus current single-channel protocols by up to 7.7Ã\u2014 in our experiments. Moreover, while we should be expecting performance gains due to channel diversity, we clearly demonstrate that up to 3.7Ã\u2014 improvement is attributed to the network organization into efficient traffic distribution structures."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10171","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10172","fieldValue":" Routing traffic subject to hose model constraints has been of much recent research interest. Two-phase routing has been proposed as a mechanism for routing traffic in the hose model. It has desirable properties in being able to statically preconfigure the transport network and in being able to handle constraints imposed by specialized service overlays. In this paper, we investigate whether the desirable properties of two-phase routing come with any resource overhead compared to: 1) direct source-destination path routing; and 2) optimal scheme among the class of all schemes that are allowed to even make the routing dynamically dependent on the traffic matrix. In the pursuit of this endeavor, we achieve several milestones. First, we develop a polynomial-size linear programming (LP) formulation for maximum throughput routing of hose traffic along direct source-destination paths. Second, we develop a polynomial-size LP formulation for maximum throughput two-phase routing of hose traffic for a generalized version of the scheme proposed in our previous work. Third, we develop a polynomial-size LP formulation for minimum-cost two-phase routing of hose traffic for the generalized version of the scheme. We also give a second (simpler) LP formulation and fast combinatorial algorithm for this problem using an upper bound on the end-to-end traffic demand. Fourth, we prove that the throughput (and cost) of two-phase routing is within a factor of 2 of that of the optimal scheme. Using the polynomial-size LP formulations developed, we compare the throughput of two-phase routing to that of direct source-destination path routing and optimal scheme on actual Internet service provider topologies collected for the Rocketfuel project and three research network topologies. The throughput of two-phase routing matches that of direct source-destination path routing and is close to that of the optimal scheme on all evaluated topologies. We conclude that two-phase routing achieves its robustness to traffic variation without imposing any appreciable additional resource requirements over previous approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10172","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
