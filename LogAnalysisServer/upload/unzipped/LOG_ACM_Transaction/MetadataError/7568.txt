Such a service has the potential to simplify a wide range of core network functions, allowing the providers to scale their operations efficiently. In this work, we study a number of problem variants related to service tier selection. Our contributions include: 1) a faster algorithm for obtaining optimal service tiers; 2) a new formulation and optimal algorithm to optimize jointly the number and magnitude of each service tier; and 3) the concept of \"TDM emulation\" in which all service tiers are multiples of the same (software-configurable) bandwidth unit, and a suite of algorithms to select jointly the basic unit and service tiers. Our work provides a systematic framework for reasoning about and tackling algorithmically the general problem of service tier selection, and has applications to a number of networking contexts, including access networks (e.g., determining the tiers for ADSL, cable modem networks or PONs) and core networks (e.g., LSP sizing for MPLS networks)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9943","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9943","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9943","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9944","fieldValue":" Recent deregulation initiatives enable cellular providers to sell excess spectrum for secondary usage. In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimal spot pricing of spectrum by a provider in the presence of both nonelastic primary users, with long-term commitments, and opportunistic, elastic secondary users. We first show that optimal pricing can be formulated as an infinite horizon average reward problem and solved using stochastic dynamic programming. Next, we investigate the design of efficient single pricing policies. We provide numerical and analytical evidences that static pricing policies do not perform well in such settings (in sharp contrast to settings where all the users are elastic). On the other hand, we prove that deterministic threshold pricing achieves optimal profit amongst all single-price policies and performs close to global optimal pricing. We characterize the profit regions of different pricing policies, as a function of the arrival rate of primary users. Under certain reasonable assumptions on the demand function, we prove that the profit region of threshold pricing is optimal and independent of the specific form of the demand function, and that it includes the profit region of static pricing. In addition, we show that the profit function of threshold pricing is unimodal in price. We determine a restricted interval in which the optimal threshold lies. These properties enable very efficient computation of the optimal threshold policy, which is far faster than that of the global optimal policy."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9944","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9944","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9944","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9945","fieldValue":" In this study, we consider optimal opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) policies for a transmitter in a multichannel wireless system, where a channel can be in one of multiple states. In such systems, the transmitter typically does not have complete information on the channel states, but can learn by probing individual channels at the expense of certain resources, e.g., energy and time. The main goal is to derive optimal strategies for determining which channels to probe, in what sequence, and which channel to use for transmission. We consider two problems within this context and show that they are equivalent to different data maximization and throughput maximization problems. For both problems, we derive key structural properties of the corresponding optimal strategy. In particular, we show that it has a threshold structure and can be described by an index policy.We further show that the optimal strategy for the first problem can only take one of three structural forms. Using these results, we first present a dynamic program that computes the optimal strategy within a finite number of steps, even when the state space is uncountably infinite. We then present and examine a more efficient, but suboptimal, two-step look-ahead strategy for each problem. These strategies are shown to be optimal for a number of cases of practical interest. We examine their performance via numerical studies."}
