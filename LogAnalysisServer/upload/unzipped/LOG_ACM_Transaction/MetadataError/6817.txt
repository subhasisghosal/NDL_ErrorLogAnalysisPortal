Real options modeling allows a cost benefit analysis to take into account managerial flexibilities when there is uncertainty in the investment, while system dynamics can build a predictive model, in which one can simulate different real-life and hypothetical scenarios in order to provide measurements that can be used in the real options model. Our return on the investment model combines these long-established quantitative techniques in a novel manner. This study applies this robust hybrid model to a challenging IT investment problem: adoption of RFID in retail. Item-level RFID is the next generation of identification technology in the retail sector. Our method can help managers to overcome the complexity and uncertainties in the investment timing of this technology. We analyze the RFID considerations in retail decision-making using real data compiled from a Delphi study. Our model demonstrates how the cost and benefits of such an investment change over time. The results highlight the variable cost of RFID tags as the key factor in the decision process concerning whether to immediately adopt or postpone the use of RFID in retail. Our exploratory work suggests that it is possible to combine merchandising and pricing issues in addition to the traditional supply chain management issues in studying any multifaceted problem in retail."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8192","fieldValue":"Real Options and System Dynamics for Information Technology Investment Decisions: Application to RFID Adoption in Retail"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8193","fieldValue":" When a medical practitioner encounters a patient with rare symptoms that translates to rare occurrences in the local database, it is quite valuable to draw conclusions collectively from such occurrences in other hospitals. However, for such rare conditions, there will be a huge imbalance in classes among the relevant base population. Due to regulations and privacy concerns, collecting data from other hospitals will be problematic. Consequently, distributed decision support systems that can use just the statistics of data from multiple hospitals are valuable. We present a system that can collectively build a distributed classification model dynamically without the need of patient data from each site in the case of imbalanced data. The system uses a voting ensemble of experts for the decision model. The imbalance condition and number of experts can be determined by the system. Since only statistics of the data and no raw data are required by the system, patient privacy issues are addressed. We demonstrate the outlined principles using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Results of experiments conducted on 7,810,762 patients from 1050 hospitals show improvement of 13.68&percnt; to 24.46&percnt; in balanced prediction accuracy using our model over the baseline model, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8193","fieldValue":"ACM"}
