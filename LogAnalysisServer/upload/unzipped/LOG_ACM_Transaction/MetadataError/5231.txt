They have recently gathered much attention as a concept to uncover structural design principles of complex networks. Kashtan et al. [Bioinformatics, 2004] proposed a sampling algorithm for performing the computationally challenging task of detecting network motifs. However, among other drawbacks, this algorithm suffers from a sampling bias and scales poorly with increasing subgraph size. Based on a detailed analysis of the previous algorithm, we present a new algorithm for network motif detection which overcomes these drawbacks. Furthermore, we present an efficient new approach for estimating the frequency of subgraphs in random networks that, in contrast to previous approaches, does not require the explicit generation of random networks. Experiments on a testbed of biological networks show our new algorithms to be orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches, allowing for the detection of larger motifs in bigger networks than previously possible and thus facilitating deeper insight into the field."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4256","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4256","fieldValue":"Network motif detection algorithm, subgraph enumeration, subgraph sampling, subgraph concentration in random graphs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4257","fieldValue":"Sagot, Marie-France"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4257","fieldValue":" The classic view of metabolism as a collection of metabolic pathways is being questioned with the currently available possibility of studying whole networks. Novel ways of decomposing the network into modules and motifs that could be considered as the building blocks of a network are being suggested. In this work, we introduce a new definition of motif in the context of metabolic networks. Unlike in previous works on (other) biochemical networks, this definition is not based only on topological features. We propose instead to use an alternative definition based on the functional nature of the components that form the motif, which we call a reaction motif. After introducing a formal framework motivated by biological considerations, we present complexity results on the problem of searching for all occurrences of a reaction motif in a network and introduce an algorithm that is fast in practice in most situations. We then show an initial application to the study of pathway evolution. Finally, we give some general features of the observed number of occurrences in order to highlight some structural features of metabolic networks."}
