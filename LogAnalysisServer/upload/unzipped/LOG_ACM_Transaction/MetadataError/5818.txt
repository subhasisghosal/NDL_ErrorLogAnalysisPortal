However, how to effectively and efficiently detect functional modules in large-scale PPI networks is still a challenging problem. We present a new framework, based on a multiple-grain model of PPI networks, to detect functional modules in PPI networks. First, we give a multiple-grain representation model of a PPI network, which has a smaller scale with super nodes. Next, we design the protein grain partitioning method, which employs a functional similarity or a structural similarity to merge some proteins layer by layer. Thirdly, a refining mechanism with border node tests is proposed to address the protein overlapping of different modules during the grain eliminating process. Finally, systematic experiments are conducted on five large-scale yeast and human networks. The results show that the framework not only significantly reduces the running time of functional module detection, but also effectively identifies overlapping modules while keeping some competitive performances, thus it is highly competent to detect functional modules in large-scale PPI networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5338","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5338","fieldValue":"Detecting Functional Modules Based on a Multiple-Grain Model in Large-Scale Protein-Protein Interaction Networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5339","fieldValue":"Hieu Tran, Ngoc"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5339","fieldValue":" Read mapping is a key task in next-generation sequencing NGS data analysis. To achieve an optimal combination of accuracy, speed, and low memory footprint, popular mapping tools often focus on identifying one or a few best mapping locations for each read. However, for many downstream analyses such as prediction of genomic variants or protein binding motifs located in repeat regions, isoform expression quantification, metagenomics analysis, it is more desirable to have a comprehensive set of all possible mapping locations of NGS reads. In this paper, we introduce AMAS, a read mapping tool that exhaustively searches for possible mapping locations of NGS reads in a reference sequence within a given edit distance. AMAS features improvements of the mapping, partition, and filtration of adaptive seeds to speed up the read mapping. Performance results on simulated and real data sets show that AMAS run several times faster than other state-of-the-art read mappers while achieving similar sensitivity and accuracy.
