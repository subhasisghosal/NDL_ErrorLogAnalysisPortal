Current approaches to identify coherence bottlenecks incur considerable run-time overhead and do not scale. We present two novel hardware-assisted coherence-analysis techniques that reduce trace sizes by two orders of magnitude over full traces. First, hardware performance monitoring is combined with capturing stores in software to provide a lossy-trace mechanism, which is an order of magnitude faster than software-instrumentation-based full-tracing and retains accuracy. Second, selected long-latency loads are instrumented via binary rewriting, which provides even higher accuracy and control over tracing, but requires additional overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1640","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1640","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7004","fieldValue":" The design of cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) is a novel and challenging research field due that it emphasizes the deep fusion of cyberspace, physical space, and social space. In this article, we extend our previously proposed system-level design framework [Zeng et al. 2015] to tailor it to the needs of social scenario of multiple users. A hierarchical Petri net-based model and social flow are presented to extend the control flow and formally describe the social interactions of multiple users, respectively. By using the extended model, the system-level optimization for CPSS can be achieved by the improved design flow. Specifically, object emplacement and user satisfaction are further extended into the social environment. Also maximal power estimation algorithm is improved, leveraging the extended intermediate representation model. Finally, we use a smart office case to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our improved design approach for multiple users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7004","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7004","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7005","fieldValue":" With the urban development and enlargement, various regions such as residential zones and administrative districts now appear as parts of cities. People exhibit different mobility patterns in each region, which is closely relevant to region-wide functions. In this article, we propose a scheme to discover region-wide functions using large-scale Shanghai taxicab trajectories that capture enormous traces for more than 13,000 taxicabs over a period of about 3 years. We investigate these taxicab trajectories and conduct an extensive preliminary study. Then, we divide the city into disjointed regions using Voronoi decomposition. By incorporating people's pick-up and drop-off information, we refine the Voronoi partitioning results to identify region-wide functional areas. Finally, we study people's movement frequency on weekdays and weekends for every kind of urban functional regions. We also look into human mobility within or across the identified urban functional regions. Experimental results show that human movement is bounded with the function of urban regions, and more than 90&percnt; of people visit neighboring (less than 20km travel distance) functional regions with high probability."}
