By platform, we mean a family of heterogeneous architectures that satisfy a set of architectural constraints imposed to allow re-use of hardware and software components. More precisely, we show how SANs can be used early in the design cycle to identify the best performance\/power trade-offs among several application-architecture combinations. Having this information available not only helps avoid lengthy simulations for predicting power and performance figures, but also enables efficient mapping of different applications onto a chosen platform. We illustrate the benefits of our methodology by using the â\u20ACœPicture-in-Pictureâ\u20AC? video decoder as a driver application."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12985","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12985","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12986","fieldValue":"Sham, Chiu-Wing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12986","fieldValue":"Young, Evangeline F Y"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12986","fieldValue":" Interconnect optimization has become the major concern in floorplanning. Many approaches would use simulated annealing (SA) with a cost function composed of a weighted sum of area, wirelength, and interconnect cost. These approaches can reduce the interconnect cost efficiently but the area penalty of the interconnect optimized floorplan is usually quite large. In this article, we propose an approach called deadspace utilization (DSU) to reclaim the unused area of an interconnect optimized floorplan by linear programming. Since modules are not necessarily rectangular in shape in floorplanning, some deadspace can be redistributed to the modules to increase the area occupied by each module. If the area of each module can be expanded by the same ratio, the whole floorplan can be compacted by that ratio to give a smaller floorplan. However, we will limit the compaction ratio to prevent overcongestion. Experiments show that we can apply this deadspace utilization technique to reduce the area and total wirelength of an interconnect optimized floorplan further while the routability can be maintained at the same time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12986","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12986","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12987","fieldValue":" We present a built-in self-test (BIST) approach for full-scan designs that extracts the most frequently occurring sequences from deterministic test patterns. The extracted sequences are stored on-chip, and are used during test application. Three sets of test patterns are applied to the circuit under test during a BIST test session; these include pseudorandom patterns, semirandom patterns, and deterministic patterns. The semirandom patterns are generated based on the stored sequences and they are more likely to detect hard-to-detect faults than pseudorandom patterns. The deterministic patterns are encoded using either the stored sequences or the LFSR reseeding technique to reduce test data volume. We use the cluster analysis technique for sequence extraction to reduce the amount of data to be stored. Experimental results for the ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits show that the proposed approach often requires less on-chip storage and test data volume than other recent BIST methods."}
