The subdivision depth is not estimated for the given curve\/surface directly. The algorithm computes a subdivision depth for the polynomial curve\/surface of which the given rational curve\/surface is the image under the standard perspective projection. This subdivision depth, however, guarantees the required flatness of the given curve\/surface after the subdivision. This work has applications in surface rendering, surface\/surface intersection, and mesh generation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/15065","fieldValue":"Be&acute;zier curves\/surfaces"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15066","fieldValue":" In this paper we describe algorithms for generating NC tool paths for machining of arbitrarily shaped 2 l\/2 dimensional pockets with arbitrary islands.
