In window-based congestion control schemes, increase rules determine how to probe available bandwidth, whereas decrease rules determine how to back off when losses due to congestion are detected. The control rules are parameterized so as to ensure that the resulting protocol is TCP-friendly in terms of the relationship between throughput and loss rate. This paper presents a comprehensive study of a new spectrum of window-based congestion controls, which are TCP-friendly as well as TCP-compatible under RED. Our controls utilize history information in their control rules. By doing so, they improve the transient behavior, compared to recently proposed slowly responsive congestion controls such as general additive-increase and multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) and binomial controls. Our controls can achieve better tradeoffs among smoothness, aggressiveness, and responsiveness, and they can achieve faster convergence. We demonstrate analytically and through extensive ns simulations the steady-state and transient behavior of several instances of this new spectrum."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9163","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
