Thus, a fiber-link failure may cause huge data (and revenue) loss. Reprovisioning (or re-optimization) of backup (or protection) bandwidth is an effective approach to improve network survivability while preventing existing services from unnecessary interruption. Most research works to date focus on applying backup-resource reprovisioning when a network failure occurs, or at some particular intervals over a certain time period. A network's state changes when any one of the following four events occurs: 1) a new connection arrives; 2) an existing connection departs; 3) a network failure occurs (e.g., a fiber cut); or 4) a failed network component (e.g., a fiber cut) is repaired. Moreover, backup-bandwidth rearrangement can also be triggered when resource overbuild (RO) [1] exceeds a predefined threshold or blocking occurs. In this study, we investigate the benefits of performing backup reprovisioning for part of (or all) the existing connections after network-state updates to improve network robustness as well as backup-bandwidth utilization in survivable telecom mesh networks. We study the effect of different backup reprovisioning periods (assuming no failure occurrence), which represents a tradeoff between capacity optimization and computation\/reconfiguration overhead. We also examine the performance of an RO-threshold-triggered backup-reprovisioning approach. A wavelength-convertible network model and shared-path-protected routing strategy are assumed in this study. We consider a link-vector model in which a vector is associated with each link in the network, indicating the amount of backup bandwidth to be reserved on the link to protect against possible failures on other links. Our simulation results demonstrate that our approaches achieve better backup-capacity utilization and network robustness, compared to a conventional scheme which reprovisions backup paths for connections only when a network failure occurs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9785","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9785","fieldValue":"WDM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9785","fieldValue":"A comprehensive study on backup-bandwidth reprovisioning after network-state updates in survivable telecom mesh networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1886","fieldValue":" We optimize a visual object detection application (that uses Vision Video Library kernels) and show that OpenCL is a unified programming paradigm that can provide high performance when running on the Ivy Bridge heterogeneous on-chip architecture.
