This article describes a new algorithm to approximate persistent fractional Brownian motions with a predefined Hurst parameter. The algorithm presents a computational complexity of O(n) and generates sequences with n (n& in; N) values with a small multiple of $log_2$(n) variables. Because it operates in a sequential manner, the algorithm is suitable for simulations demanding real-time operation. A network traffic simulator is presented as one of its possible applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25049","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25049","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25050","fieldValue":" Given a black box that generates independent Bernoulli samples with an unknown bias p, we consider the problem of simulating a Bernoulli random variable with bias f(p) (where f is a given function) using a finite (computable in advance) number of independent Bernoulli samples from the black box. We show that this is possible if and only if f is a Bernstein polynomial with coefficients between 0 and 1, and we explicitly give the algorithm. Our results differ from Keane and O'Brien [1994] in that our goal is more modest\/stringent, since we are considering algorithms that use a finite number of samples as opposed to allowing a random number (such as in acceptance rejection algorithms)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25050","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25050","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25051","fieldValue":" In this article we explain some connections between Lyapunov methods and subsolutions of an associated Isaacs equation for the design of efficient importance sampling schemes. As we shall see, subsolutions can be derived by taking an appropriate limit of an associated Lyapunov inequality. They have been recently proposed in several works of Dupuis, Wang, and others and applied to address several important problems in rare-event simulation. Lyapunov inequalities have been used for testing the efficiency of state-dependent importance sampling schemes in heavy-tailed or discrete settings in a variety of works by Blanchet, Glynn, and others. While subsolutions provide an analytic criterion for the construction of efficient samplers, Lyapunov inequalities are useful for finding more precise information, in the form of bounds, for the behavior of the coefficient of variation of the associated importance sampling estimator in the prelimit. In addition, Lyapunov inequalities provide insight into the various mollification procedures that are often required in constructing associated subsolutions. Our aim is to demonstrate that applying Lyapunov inequalities for verification of efficiency can help both guide the selection of various mollification parameters and sharpen the information on the efficiency gain induced by the sampler."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25051","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25051","fieldValue":"ACM"}
