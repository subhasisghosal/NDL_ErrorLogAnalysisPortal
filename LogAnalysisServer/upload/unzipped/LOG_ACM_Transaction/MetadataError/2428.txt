The fastest known algorithm for k-MlD is based on $2^k$ evaluations of the circuit over a suitable algebra. We use communication complexity to show that it is essentially optimal within this evaluation framework. On the positive side, we give additional applications of the method: finding a copy of a given tree on k nodes, a minimum set of nodes that dominate at least t nodes, and an m-dimensional k-matching. In each case, we achieve a faster algorithm than what was known before. We also apply the algebraic method to problems in exact counting. Among other results, we show that a variation of it can break the trivial upper bounds for the disjoint summation problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2705","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2705","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18192","fieldValue":"ACM"}
