The logic is based on modalities which allow one to specify what a process produces as a reaction to what its environment inputs. These modalities provide an assumption\/commitment style of specification which allows a sound and complete compositional axiomatization of the reactive behavior of timed concurrent constraint programs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11416","fieldValue":"Langunou, ric"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11416","fieldValue":" Many problems in robust control and motion planning can be reduced to either finding a sound approximation of the solution space determined by a set of nonlinear inequalities, or to the \"guaranteed tuning problem\" as defined by Jaulin and Walter, which amounts to finding a value for some tuning parameter such that a set of inequalities be verified for all the possible values of some perturbation vector. A classical approach to solving these problems, which satisfies the strong soundness requirement, involves some quantifier elimination procedure such as Collins' Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition symbolic method. Sound numerical methods using interval arithmetic and local consistency enforcement to prune the search space are presented in this article as much faster alternatives for both soundly solving systems of nonlinear inequalities, and addressing the guaranteed tuning problem whenever the perturbation vector has dimension 1. The use of these methods in camera control is investigated, and experiments with the prototype of a declarative modeler to express camera motion using a cinematic language are reported and commented upon."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11417","fieldValue":"La Torre, Salvatore"}
