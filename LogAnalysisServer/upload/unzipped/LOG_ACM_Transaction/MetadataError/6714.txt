{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7919","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of learning incoherent sparse and low-rank patterns from multiple tasks. Our approach is based on a linear multitask learning formulation, in which the sparse and low-rank patterns are induced by a cardinality regularization term and a low-rank constraint, respectively. This formulation is nonconvex; we convert it into its convex surrogate, which can be routinely solved via semidefinite programming for small-size problems. We propose employing the general projected gradient scheme to efficiently solve such a convex surrogate; however, in the optimization formulation, the objective function is nondifferentiable and the feasible domain is nontrivial. We present the procedures for computing the projected gradient and ensuring the global convergence of the projected gradient scheme. The computation of the projected gradient involves a constrained optimization problem; we show that the optimal solution to such a problem can be obtained via solving an unconstrained optimization subproblem and a Euclidean projection subproblem. We also present two projected gradient algorithms and analyze their rates of convergence in detail. In addition, we illustrate the use of the presented projected gradient algorithms for the proposed multitask learning formulation using the least squares loss. Experimental results on a collection of real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multitask learning formulation and the efficiency of the proposed projected gradient algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7920","fieldValue":"Yu, Hsiang-Fu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7920","fieldValue":"Hsieh, Cho-Jui"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7920","fieldValue":"Chang, Kai-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7920","fieldValue":"Lin, Chih-Jen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7920","fieldValue":" Recent advances in linear classification have shown that for applications such as document classification, the training process can be extremely efficient. However, most of the existing training methods are designed by assuming that data can be stored in the computer memory. These methods cannot be easily applied to data larger than the memory capacity due to the random access to the disk. We propose and analyze a block minimization framework for data larger than the memory size. At each step a block of data is loaded from the disk and handled by certain learning methods. We investigate two implementations of the proposed framework for primal and dual SVMs, respectively. Because data cannot fit in memory, many design considerations are very different from those for traditional algorithms. We discuss and compare with existing approaches that are able to handle data larger than memory. Experiments using data sets 20 times larger than the memory demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7920","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7920","fieldValue":"ACM"}
