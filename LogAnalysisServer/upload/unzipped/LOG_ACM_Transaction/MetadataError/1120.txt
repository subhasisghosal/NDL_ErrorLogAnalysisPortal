{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14377","fieldValue":" XML is widely recognized as the data interchange standard of tomorrow because of its ability to represent data from a variety of sources. Hence, XML is likely to be the format through which data from multiple sources is integrated. In this article, we study the problem of integrating XML data sources through correlations realized as join operations. A challenging aspect of this operation is the XML document structure. Two documents might convey approximately or exactly the same information but may be quite different in structure. Consequently, an approximate match in structure, in addition to content, has to be folded into the join operation. We quantify an approximate match in structure and content for pairs of XML documents using well defined notions of distance. We show how notions of distance that have metric properties can be incorporated in a framework for joins between XML data sources and introduce the idea of reference sets to facilitate this operation. Intuitively, a reference set consists of data elements used to project the data space. We characterize what constitutes a good choice of a reference set, and we propose sampling-based algorithms to identify them. We then instantiate our join framework using the tree edit distance between a pair of trees. We next turn our attention to utilizing well known index structures to improve the performance of approximate XML join operations. We present a methodology enabling adaptation of index structures for this problem, and we instantiate it in terms of the R-tree. We demonstrate the practical utility of our solutions using large collections of real and synthetic XML data sets, varying parameters of interest, and highlighting the performance benefits of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14377","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14378","fieldValue":" We study the representation and querying of XML with incomplete information. We consider a simple model for XML data and their DTDs, a very simple query language, and a representation system for incomplete information in the spirit of the representations systems developed by Imielinski and Lipski [1984] for relational databases. In the scenario we consider, the incomplete information about an XML document is continuously enriched by successive queries to the document. We show that our representation system can represent partial information about the source document acquired by successive queries, and that it can be used to intelligently answer new queries. We also consider the impact on complexity of enriching our representation system or query language with additional features. The results suggest that our approach achieves a practically appealing balance between expressiveness and tractability."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14378","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14378","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14378","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14379","fieldValue":"altenis, Simonas"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14379","fieldValue":" With the proliferation of wireless communications and geo-positioning, e-services are envisioned that exploit the positions of a set of continuously moving users to provide context-aware functionality to each individual user. Because advances in disk capacities continue to outperform Moore's Law, it becomes increasingly feasible to store online all the position information obtained from the moving e-service users. With the much slower advances in I\/O speeds and many concurrent users, indexing techniques are of the essence in this scenario.Existing indexing techniques come in two forms. Some techniques capture the position of an object up until the time of the most recent position sample, while other techniques represent an object's position as a constant or linear function of time and capture the position from the current time and into the (near) future. This article offers an indexing technique capable of capturing the positions of moving objects at all points in time. The index substantially modifies partial persistence techniques, which support transaction time, to support valid time for monitoring applications. The performance of a timeslice query is independent of the number of past position samples stored for an object. No existing indices exist with these characteristics."}
