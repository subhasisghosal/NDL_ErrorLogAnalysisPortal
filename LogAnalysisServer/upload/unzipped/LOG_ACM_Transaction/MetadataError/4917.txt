Unlike for online profiles and social graphs, most users are unaware of the privacy risks relating to shared images, as they do not directly disclose characteristics such as gender and origin. Recently, however, user-shared images have been proven to be an accessible alternative to social graphs for online friendship recommendation and gender identification. This article evaluates 1.6M user-shared images from an image-oriented social network, Fotolog, and concludes how they can create privacy risks by proposing a system for de-anonymization, as well as inferring information on online profiles with the user-shared images. It is concluded that given user-shared images, using social graphs is 2 and 2.5 times more effective in de-anonymization than using origins or genders. With two showcases, it is also proven that using user-shared images is effective in online friendship recommendation, gender identification, and origin inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to evaluate the privacy issue qualitatively with big multimedia data from a real social network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25757","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25757","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25758","fieldValue":"Hsu, Ching-Hsien"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25758","fieldValue":" Reputation plays an important role for users in choosing or paying for multimedia applications or services. Some efficient multimedia reputation-measurement approaches have been proposed to achieve accurate reputation measurement based on feedback ratings that users give to a multimedia service after invoking. However, the implementation of these approaches suffers from the problems of wide abuse and low utilization of user context. In this article, we study the relationship between user context and feedback ratings according to which one user often gives different feedback ratings to the same multimedia service in different user contexts. We further propose an enhanced user context-aware reputation-measurement approach for multimedia services that is accurate in two senses: (1) Each multimedia service has three reputation values with three different user context levels when its feedback ratings are sufficient and (2) the reputation of a multimedia service with different user context levels is found using user context sensitivity and user similarity when its feedback ratings are limited or not available. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms other approaches in terms of accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25758","fieldValue":"ACM"}
