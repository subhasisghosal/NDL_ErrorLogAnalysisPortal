{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11002","fieldValue":" Virtual machines VMs are widely adopted today to provide elastic computing services in datacenters, and they still heavily rely on TCP for congestion control. VM scheduling delays due to CPU sharing can cause frequent spurious retransmit timeouts RTOs. Using current detection methods, we find that such spurious RTOs cannot be effectively identified because of the retransmission ambiguity caused by the delayed ACK DelACK mechanism. Disabling DelACK would add significant CPU overhead to the VMs and thus degrade the network's performance. In this paper, we first report our practical experience about TCP's reaction to VM scheduling delays. We then provide an analysis of the problem that has two components corresponding to VM preemption on the sender side and the receiver side, respectively. Finally, we propose PVTCP, a ParaVirtualized approach to counteract the distortion of congestion information caused by the hypervisor scheduler. PVTCP is completely embedded in the guest OS and requires no modification in the hypervisor. Taking incast congestion as an example, we evaluate our solution in a 21-node testbed. The results show that PVTCP has high adaptability in virtualized environments and deals satisfactorily with the throughput collapse problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11002","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11003","fieldValue":"Guanfeng Liang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11003","fieldValue":" Recent literature including our past work provides analysis and solutions for using: 1 erasure coding; 2 parallelism; or 3 variable slicing\/chunking i.e., dividing an object of a specific size into a variable number of smaller chunks in speeding up the I\/O performance of storage clouds. However, a comprehensive approach that considers all three dimensions together to achieve the best throughput-delay tradeoff curve had been lacking. This paper presents the first set of solutions that can pick the best combination of coding redundancy ratio and object chunking\/slicing options as the load dynamically changes. Our specific contributions are as follows: 1 We establish via measurements that combining variable redundancy ratio and chunking is mostly feasible over a popular public cloud. 2 We relate the delay-optimal values for chunking level and code redundancy ratio to the queue backlogs via an approximate queuing analysis. 3 Based on this analysis, we propose TOFEC that adapts the chunking level and redundancy ratio against the queue backlogs. Our trace-driven simulation results show that TOFEC's adaptation mechanism converges to an appropriate code that provides the optimal throughput-delay tradeoff without reducing system capacity. Compared to a nonadaptive strategy optimized for throughput, TOFEC delivers 2.5Ã\u2014 lower latency under light workloads; compared to a nonadaptive strategy optimized for latency, TOFEC can scale to support over 3Ã\u2014 as many requests. 4 We propose a simpler greedy solution that performs on a par with TOFEC in average delay performance, but exhibits significantly more performance variations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11003","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11004","fieldValue":"Anh Le"}
