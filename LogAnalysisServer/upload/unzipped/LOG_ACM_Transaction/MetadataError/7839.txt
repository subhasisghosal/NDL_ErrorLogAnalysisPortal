Specifically, due to the high propagation delay of acoustic signals in UWSNs, referred as spatial-temporal uncertainty, current terrestrial MAC schemes do not work well in UWSNs. Hence, we consider spatial-temporal uncertainty in the design of an energy-efficient TDMA-based MAC protocol for UWSNs. We first translate the TDMA-based scheduling problem in UWSNs into a special vertex-coloring problem in the context of a spatial-temporal conflict graph (ST-CG) that describes explicitly the conflict delays among transmission links. With the help of the ST-CG, we propose two novel heuristic approaches: 1) the traffic-based one-step trial approach (TOTA) to solve the coloring problem in a centralized fashion; and for scalability, 2) the distributed traffic-based one-step trial approach (DTOTA) to assign the data schedule for tree-based routing structures in a distributed manner. In addition, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is derived to obtain a theoretical bound for the TDMA-based scheduling problem in UWSNs. Finally, a comprehensive performance study is presented, showing that both TOTA and DTOTA guarantee collision-free transmission. They thus outperform existing MAC schemes such as S-MAC, ECDiG, and T-Lohi in terms of network throughput and energy consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10492","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10492","fieldValue":"TDMA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10493","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study the One-Sender-Multiple-Receiver (OSMR) transmission technique, which allows one sender to send to multiple receivers simultaneously by utilizing multiple antennas at the sender. To study the physical-layer characteristics of OSMR, we implement a prototype OSMR transmitter\/receiver with GNU software defined radio and conduct experiments in a university building. Our results are positive and show that wireless channels allow OSMR for a significant percentage of the time. Motivated by our physical-layer study, we propose extensions to the 802.11 MAC protocol to support OSMR transmission, which is backward-compatible with existing 802.11 devices. We also note that the access point (AP) needs a packet scheduling algorithm to efficiently exploit OSMR. We show that the scheduling problem without considering the packet transmission overhead can be formalized as a linear programming problem, but the scheduling problem considering the overhead is NP-hard. We then propose a practical scheduler based on a two-phase algorithm that can also handle channel fluctuations. We test the proposed protocol and algorithm with simulations driven by traffic traces collected from wireless LANs and channel-state traces collected from our experiments, and the results show that OSMR significantly improves the downlink performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10493","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
