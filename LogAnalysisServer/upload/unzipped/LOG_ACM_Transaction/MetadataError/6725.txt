{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1718","fieldValue":" The trends in enterprise IT toward service-oriented computing, server consolidation, and virtual computing point to a future in which workloads are becoming increasingly diverse in terms of performance, reliability, and availability requirements. It can be expected that more and more applications with diverse requirements will run on a Chip Multi-Processor (CMP) and share platform resources such as the lowest level cache and off-chip bandwidth. In this environment, it is desirable to have microarchitecture and software support that can provide a guarantee of a certain level of performance, which we refer to as performance Quality of Service. In this article, we investigated a framework would be needed to manage the shared cache resource for fully providing QoS in a CMP. We found in order to fully provide QoS, we need to specify an appropriate QoS target for each job and apply an admission control policy to accept jobs only when their QoS targets can be satisfied. We also found that providing strict QoS often leads to a significant reduction in throughput due to resource fragmentation. We proposed throughput optimization techniques that include: (1) exploiting various QoS execution modes, and (2) a microarchitecture technique, which we refer to as resource stealing, that detects and reallocates excess cache capacity from a job while preserving its QoS target. We designed and evaluated three algorithms for performing resource stealing, which differ in how aggressive they are in stealing excess cache capacity, and in the degree of confidence in meeting QoS targets. In addition, we proposed a mechanism to dynamically enable or disable resource stealing depending on whether other jobs can benefit from additional cache capacity. We evaluated our QoS framework with a full system simulation of a 4-core CMP and a recent version of the Linux Operating System. We found that compared to an unoptimized scheme, the throughput can be improved by up to 47&percnt;, making the throughput significantly closer to a non-QoS CMP."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1718","fieldValue":"CMP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1718","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1718","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7945","fieldValue":" We study how links are formed in social networks. In particular, we focus on investigating how a reciprocal (two-way) link, the basic relationship in social networks, is developed from a parasocial (one-way) relationship and how the relationships further develop into triadic closure, one of the fundamental processes of link formation. We first investigate how geographic distance and interactions between users influence the formation of link structure among users. Then we study how social theories including homophily, social balance, and social status are satisfied over networks with parasocial and reciprocal relationships. The study unveils several interesting phenomena. For example, â\u20ACœfriend's friend is a friendâ\u20AC? indeed exists in the reciprocal relationship network, but does not hold in the parasocial relationship network. We propose a learning framework to formulate the problems of predicting reciprocity and triadic closure into a graphical model. We demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 90&percnt; of reciprocal relationships in a Twitter network. The proposed model also achieves better performance (&plus;20--30&percnt; in terms of F1-measure) than several alternative methods for predicting the triadic closure formation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7946","fieldValue":" Learning explanatory features across multiple related tasks, or MultiTask Feature Selection (MTFS), is an important problem in the applications of data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Previous MTFS methods fulfill this task by batch-mode training. This makes them inefficient when data come sequentially or when the number of training data is so large that they cannot be loaded into the memory simultaneously. In order to tackle these problems, we propose a novel online learning framework to solve the MTFS problem. A main advantage of the online algorithm is its efficiency in both time complexity and memory cost. The weights of the MTFS models at each iteration can be updated by closed-form solutions based on the average of previous subgradients. This yields the worst-case bounds of the time complexity and memory cost at each iteration, both in the order of O(d Ã\u2014 Q), where d is the number of feature dimensions and Q is the number of tasks. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis for the average regret of the online learning algorithms, which also guarantees the convergence rate of the algorithms. Finally, we conduct detailed experiments to show the characteristics and merits of the online learning algorithms in solving several MTFS problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7946","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7946","fieldValue":"ACM"}
