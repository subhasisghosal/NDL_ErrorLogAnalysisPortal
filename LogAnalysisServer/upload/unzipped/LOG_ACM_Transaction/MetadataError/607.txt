Empirical data suggests that both data volume and application time will increase dramatically for such transition testing. Techniques to address the above problem for a class of transition tests, called enhanced transition tests, are proposed in this article.The first technique, which combines the proposed transition test chains with the ATE repeat capability, reduces test data volume by 46.5&percent; when compared with transition tests computed by a commercial transition test ATPG tool. However, the test application time may sometimes increase. To address the test time issue, a new DFT technique, Exchange Scan, is proposed. Exchange scan reduces both data volume and application time by 46.5&percent;. These techniques rely on the use of hold-scan cells and highlight the effectiveness of hold-scan design to address test time and test data volume issues. In addition, we address the problem of yield loss due to incidental overtesting of functionally-untestable transition faults, and we formulate an efficient adjustment to the algorithm to keep the overtest ratio low. Our experimental results show that up to 14.5&percent; reduction in overtest ratio can be achieved, with an average overtest reduction of 4.68&percent;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12919","fieldValue":"Poon, Kara K W"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12919","fieldValue":"Wilton, Steven J E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12919","fieldValue":" Power has become a critical issue for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) vendors. Understanding the power dissipation within FPGAs is the first step in developing power-efficient architectures and computer-aided design (CAD) tools for FPGAs. This article describes a detailed and flexible power model which has been integrated in the widely used Versatile Place and Route (VPR) CAD tool. This power model estimates the dynamic, short-circuit, and leakage power consumed by FPGAs. It is the first flexible power model developed to evaluate architectural tradeoffs and the efficiency of power-aware CAD tools for a variety of FPGA architectures, and is freely available for noncommercial use. The model is flexible, in that it can estimate the power for a wide variety of FPGA architectures, and it is fast, in that it does not require extensive simulation, meaning it can be used to explore a large architectural space. We show how the model can be used to investigate the impact of various architectural parameters on the energy consumed by the FPGA, focusing on the segment length, switch block topology, lookuptable size, and cluster size."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12920","fieldValue":" It is well known that wafer-probe test costs of analog ICs are an order of magnitude less than the corresponding test costs of assembled packages. It is therefore natural to push as much of the testing process into wafer-probe testing as possible to reduce the scope of assembled package testing. However, the signal drive and response observation capabilities during wafer probe testing are limited in comparison to assembled packages. In this article, it is shown that by using band-limited transient test signals, which can be supported by wafer-probe test instrumentation, significant numbers of bad ICs can be detected early during the wafer-probe test. The optimal test stimuli are determined by cooptimizing the wafer-probe and assembled package test waveforms. Overall test costs, including the cost of packaging bad ICs, are minimized and are reduced up to four times. The proposed method has been validated using hardware test data, which were obtained through measurements made on a prototype."}
