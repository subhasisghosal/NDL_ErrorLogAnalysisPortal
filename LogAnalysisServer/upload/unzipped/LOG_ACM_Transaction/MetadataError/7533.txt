While many protocols have claimed to achieve significant duty-cycling benefits in theory and simulation, these benefits have often not translated into practice. The dominant factor that prevents the optimal usage of the radio in real deployment settings is time uncertainty between sensor nodes which results in overhead in the form of long packet preambles, guard bands, and excessive control packets for synchronization. This paper proposes an uncertainty-driven approach to duty-cycling, where a model of long-term clock drift is used to minimize the duty-cycling overhead. First, we use long-term empirical measurements to evaluate and analyze in-depth the interplay between three key parameters that influence long-term synchronization: synchronization rate, history of past synchronization beacons, and the estimation scheme. Second, we use this measurement-based study to design a rate-adaptive, energy-efficient long-term time synchronization algorithm that can adapt to changing clock drift and environmental conditions, while achieving application-specific precision with very high probability. Finally, we integrate our uncertainty-driven time synchronization scheme with the BMAC medium access control protocol, and demonstrate one to two orders of magnitude reduction in transmission energy consumption with negligible impact on packet loss rate."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9874","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9874","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9874","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9875","fieldValue":" In this paper, we analyze the impact of straight line routing in large homogeneous multi-hop wireless networks. We estimate the nodal load, which is defined as the number of packets served at a node, induced by straight line routing. For a given total offered load on the network, our analysis shows that the nodal load at each node is a function of the node's Voronoi cell, the node's location in the network, and the traffic pattern specified by the source and destination randomness and straight line routing. In the asymptotic regime, we show that each node's probability that the node serves a packet arriving to the network approaches the products of half the length of the Voronoi cell perimeter and the load density function that a packet goes through the node's location. The density function depends on the traffic pattern generated by straight line routing, and determines where the hot spot is created in the network. Hence, contrary to conventional wisdom, straight line routing can balance the load over the network, depending on the traffic patterns."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9875","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9875","fieldValue":"ACM"}
