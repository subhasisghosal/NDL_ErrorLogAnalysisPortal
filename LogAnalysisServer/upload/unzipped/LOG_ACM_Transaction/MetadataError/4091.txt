We develop a machine-learning-based classifier to identify ads-portal domains, which has 96&percnt; accuracy. We use this classifier to measure the prevalence of ads-portal domains on the Internet. Surprisingly, 28.3\/25&percnt; of the (two-level) &ast;.com\/&ast;.net web domains are ads-portal domains. Also, 41\/39.8&percnt; of &ast;.com\/&ast;.net ads-portal domains are typos of well-known domains, also known as typo-squatting domains. In addition, we use the classifier along with DNS trace files to estimate how often Internet users visit ads-portal domains. It turns out that ∼5&percnt; of the two-level &ast;.com, &ast;.net, &ast;.org, &ast;.biz and &ast;.info web domains on the traces are ads-portal domains and ∼50&percnt; of these accessed ads-portal domains are typos. These numbers show that ads-portal domains and typo-squatting ads-portal domains are prevalent on the Internet and successful in attracting many visits. Our classifier represents a step towards better categorizing the web documents. It can also be helpful to search engines ranking algorithms, helpful in identifying web spams that redirects to ads-portal domains, and used to discourage access to typo-squatting ads-portal domains."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3264","fieldValue":" Historical background and motivation for ICAD2003 paper is presented.

However, recent work demonstrates that the absence of reporting incentives leads to a biased set of reviews that may not reflect the true quality. In this paper, we investigate underlying factors that influence users when reporting feedback. In particular, we study both reporting incentives and reporting biases observed in a widely used review forum, the Tripadvisor Web site. We consider three sources of information: first, the numerical ratings left by the user for different aspects of quality; second, the textual comment accompanying a review; third, the patterns in the time sequence of reports. We first show that groups of users who discuss a certain feature at length are more likely to agree in their ratings. Second, we show that users are more motivated to give feedback when they perceive a greater risk involved in a transaction. Third, a user's rating partly reflects the difference between true quality and prior expectation of quality, as inferred from previous reviews. We finally observe that because of these biases, when averaging review scores there are strong differences between the mean and the median. We speculate that the median may be a better way to summarize the ratings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23206","fieldValue":"ACM"}
