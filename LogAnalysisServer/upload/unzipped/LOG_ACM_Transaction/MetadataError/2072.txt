The meta-representation learns the configurations of shape parts that are common across the family, and encapsulates this knowledge with a system of geometric distributions that encode relative arrangements of parts. Thus, instead of predefined priors, what characterizes a shape family is directly learned from the set of input shapes. The meta-representation is constructed from a set of co-segmented shapes with known correspondence. It can then be used in several applications where we seek to preserve the identity of the shapes as members of the family. We demonstrate applications of the meta-representation in exploration of shape repositories, where interesting shape configurations can be examined in the set; guided editing, where models can be edited while maintaining their familial traits; and coupled editing, where several shapes can be collectively deformed by directly manipulating the distributions in the meta-representation. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed representation on a variety of shape collections."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17028","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17028","fieldValue":" We introduce focal points for characterizing, comparing, and organizing collections of complex and heterogeneous data and apply the concepts and algorithms developed to collections of 3D indoor scenes. We represent each scene by a graph of its constituent objects and define focal points as representative substructures in a scene collection. To organize a heterogeneous scene collection, we cluster the scenes based on a set of extracted focal points: scenes in a cluster are closely connected when viewed from the perspective of the representative focal points of that cluster. The key concept of representativity requires that the focal points occur frequently in the cluster and that they result in a compact cluster. Hence, the problem of focal point extraction is intermixed with the problem of clustering groups of scenes based on their representative focal points. We present a co-analysis algorithm which interleaves frequent pattern mining and subspace clustering to extract a set of contextual focal points which guide the clustering of the scene collection. We demonstrate advantages of focal-centric scene comparison and organization over existing approaches, particularly in dealing with hybrid scenes, scenes consisting of elements which suggest membership in different semantic categories."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17028","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17028","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17029","fieldValue":" The construction of networks of maps among shapes in a collection enables a variety of applications in data-driven geometry processing. A key task in network construction is to make the maps consistent with each other. This consistency constraint, when properly defined, leads not only to a concise representation of such networks, but more importantly, it serves as a strong regularizer for correcting and improving noisy initial maps computed between pairs of shapes in isolation. Up-to-now, however, the consistency constraint has only been fully formulated for point-based maps or for shape collections that are fully similar. In this paper, we introduce a framework for computing consistent functional maps within heterogeneous shape collections. In such collections not all shapes share the same structure --- different types of shared structure may be present within different (but possibly overlapping) sub-collections. Unlike point-based maps, functional maps can encode similarities at multiple levels of detail (points or parts), and thus are particularly suitable for coping with such diversity within a shape collection. We show how to rigorously formulate the consistency constraint in the functional map setting. The formulation leads to a powerful tool for computing consistent functional maps, and also for discovering shared structures, such as meaningful shape parts. We also show how to adapt the procedure for handling very large-scale shape collections. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework significantly improves upon state-of-the-art data-driven techniques. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework in shape co-segmentation and various shape exploration tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17029","fieldValue":"ACM"}
