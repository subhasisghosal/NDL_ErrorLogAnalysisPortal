The proposed algorithm is designed to automatically identify 25 types of risk factors with specific meanings reported in Section 1A of SEC form 10-K. The idea of ML-CKNN is to compute a categorical similarity score for each label by the K-nearest neighbors in that category. ML-CKNN is tailored to achieve the goal of extracting risk factors from 10Ks. The proposed algorithm can perfectly classify 74.94&percnt; of risk factors and 98.75&percnt; of labels. Moreover, ML-CKNN is empirically shown to outperform ML-KNN and other multilabel algorithms. The extracted risk factors could be valuable to empirical studies in accounting or finance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8153","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8153","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8153","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8154","fieldValue":"Lin, Ming-Chih"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8154","fieldValue":"Lee, Anthony J T"}
