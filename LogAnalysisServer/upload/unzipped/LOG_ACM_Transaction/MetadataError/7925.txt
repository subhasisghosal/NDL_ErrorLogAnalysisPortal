In particular, we develop distributed techniques for iterative real-time computation of the spectral radius of an unknown network matrix (often the Perron root of the matrix) that indicates the time-varying limits of power control stability, i.e., the limits of network capacity. Solely locally available information is used as algorithmic input. By drawing a formal analogy with the Google PageRank algorithm, the computations are shown analytically to be exponentially fast and sufficiently accurate for optimal (error-free) stability detection. Numerical simulations of an existing office building demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithms to actual UMTS W-CDMA systems characterized by discrete power control with limited step-size."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10664","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10664","fieldValue":"Enabling co-channel small-cell deployments in SINR-constraint networks by distributed monitoring of normalized network capacity"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10664","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10664","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10665","fieldValue":" We address the dimensioning of infrastructure, comprising both network and server resources, for large-scale decentralized distributed systems such as grids or clouds. We design the resulting grid\/cloud to be resilient against network link or server failures. To this end, we exploit relocation: Under failure conditions, a grid job or cloud virtual machine may be served at an alternate destination (i.e., different from the one under failure-free conditions). We thus consider grid\/cloud requests to have a known origin, but assume a degree of freedom as to where they end up being served, which is the case for grid applications of the bag-of-tasks (BoT) type or hosted virtual machines in the cloud case. We present a generic methodology based on integer linear programming (ILP) that: 1) chooses a given number of sites in a given network topology where to install server infrastructure; and 2) determines the amount of both network and server capacity to cater for both the failure-free scenario and failures of links or nodes. For the latter, we consider either failure-independent (FID) or failure-dependent (FD) recovery. Case studies on European-scale networks show that relocation allows considerable reduction of the total amount of network and server resources, especially in sparse topologies and for higher numbers of server sites. Adopting a failure-dependent backup routing strategy does lead to lower resource dimensions, but only when we adopt relocation (especially for a high number of server sites): Without exploiting relocation, potential savings of FD versus FID are not meaningful."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10665","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10665","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10665","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10666","fieldValue":" Virtual network embedding, which means mapping virtual networks requested by users to a shared substrate network maintained by an Internet service provider, is a key function that network virtualization needs to provide. Prior work on virtual network embedding has primarily focused on maximizing the revenue of the Internet service provider and did not consider the energy cost in accommodating such requests. As energy cost is more than half of the operating cost of the substrate networks, while trying to accommodate more virtual network requests, minimizing energy cost is critical for infrastructure providers. In this paper, we make the first effort toward energy-aware virtual network embedding. We first propose an energy cost model and formulate the energy-aware virtual network embedding problem as an integer linear programming problem. We then propose two efficient energy-aware virtual network embedding algorithms: a heuristic-based algorithm and a particle-swarm-optimization-technique-based algorithm. We implemented our algorithms in C++ and performed side-by-side comparison with prior algorithms. The simulation results show that our algorithms significantly reduce the energy cost by up to 50% over the existing algorithm for accommodating the same sequence of virtual network requests."}
