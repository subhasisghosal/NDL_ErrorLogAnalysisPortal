Without requiring a priori probability of target presence, the fusion threshold bounds derived using Chebyshev's inequality ensure a higher hit rate and lower false alarm rate compared to the weighted averages of individual sensors. The Monte Carlo-based simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves target detection performance, and can also be used to guide the actual threshold selection in practical sensor network implementation under certain error rate constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3031","fieldValue":" Word reordering is a difficult task for translation between languages with widely different word orders, such as Japanese and English. A previously proposed post-ordering method for Japanese-to-English translation first translates a Japanese sentence into a sequence of English words in a word order similar to that of Japanese, then reorders the sequence into an English word order. We employed this post-ordering framework and improved upon its reordering method. The existing post-ordering method reorders the sequence of English words via SMT, whereas our method reorders the sequence by (1) parsing the sequence using ITG to obtain syntactic structures which are similar to Japanese syntactic structures, and (2) transferring the obtained syntactic structures into English syntactic structures according to the ITG. The experiments using Japanese-to-English patent translation demonstrated the effectiveness of our method and showed that both the RIBES and BLEU scores were improved over compared methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3031","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3031","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21307","fieldValue":" We present a scalable end-to-end system for vision-based monitoring of natural environments, and illustrate its use for the analysis of avian nesting cycles.

We automate the analysis of raw imaging data using statistics that are tailored to the task of interest. These â\u20ACœfeaturesâ\u20AC? are a representation to be fed to classifiers that exploit spatial and temporal consistencies. Our testbed can detect the presence or absence of a bird with an accuracy of 82&percnt;, count eggs with an accuracy of 84&percnt;, and detect the inception of the nesting stage within a day. Our results demonstrate the challenges and potential benefits of using imagers as biological sensors. An exploration of system performance under varying image resolution and frame rate suggest that an in situ adaptive vision system is technically feasible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21308","fieldValue":" Boundary recognition is an important and challenging issue in wireless sensor networks when no coordinates or distances are available. The distinction between inner and boundary nodes of the network can provide valuable knowledge to a broad spectrum of algorithms. This article tackles the challenge of providing a scalable and range-free solution for boundary recognition that does not require a high node density. We explain the challenges of accurately defining the boundary of a wireless sensor network with and without node positions and provide a new definition of network boundary in the discrete domain. Our solution for boundary recognition approximates the boundary of the sensor network by determining the majority of inner nodes using geometric constructions, which guarantee that for a given d, a node lies inside of the construction for a d-quasi unit disk graph model of the wireless sensor network. Moreover, such geometric constructions make it possible to compute a guaranteed distance from a node to the boundary. We present a fully distributed algorithm for boundary recognition based on these concepts and perform a detailed complexity analysis. We provide a thorough evaluation of our approach and show that it is applicable to dense as well as sparse deployments."}
