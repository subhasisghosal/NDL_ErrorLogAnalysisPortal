The proposed method is scalable with respect to both channel bandwidth and channel packet-loss rate. We jointly design source and channel coders using a statistical measure that (i) calculates the number of both source and channel coding bits, and (ii) distributes the channel coding bits among the transmitted refinement levels in order to maximize the expected decoded model quality. In order to keep the total number of bits before and after applying error protection the same, we transmit fewer triangles in the latter case to accommodate the channel coding bits. When the proposed method is used to transmit a typical model over a channel with a 10&percnt; packet-loss rate, the distortion (measured using the Hausdorff distance between the original and the decoded models) is reduced by 50&percnt; compared to the case when no error protection is applied."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15506","fieldValue":" We present a novel generalization of the quadric error metric used in surface simplification that can be used for simplifying simplicial complexes of any type embedded in Euclidean spaces of any dimension. We demonstrate that our generalized simplification system can produce high quality approximations of plane and space curves, triangulated surfaces, tetrahedralized volume data, and simplicial complexes of mixed type. Our method is both efficient and easy to implement. It is capable of processing complexes of arbitrary topology, including nonmanifolds, and can preserve intricate boundaries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15507","fieldValue":" We present an approach for modeling and rendering a dynamic, real-world event from an arbitrary viewpoint, and at any time, using images captured from multiple video cameras. The event is modeled as a nonrigidly varying dynamic scene, captured by many images from different viewpoints, at discrete times. First, the spatio-temporal geometric properties (shape and instantaneous motion) are computed. The view synthesis problem is then solved using a reverse mapping algorithm, ray-casting across space and time, to compute a novel image from any viewpoint in the 4D space of position and time. Results are shown on real-world events captured in the CMU 3D Room, by creating synthetic renderings of the event from novel, arbitrary positions in space and time. Multiple such recreated renderings can be put together to create retimed fly-by movies of the event, with the resulting visual experience richer than that of a regular video clip, or switching between images from multiple cameras."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15507","fieldValue":"ACM"}
