We present algorithms that achieve anonymous communication, are protected against traffic analysis, and require O(1) amortized communication complexity on each link and low computational comlexity. The algorithms support sender anonymity, receiver(s) anonymity, or sender-receiver anonymity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22105","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22105","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22106","fieldValue":" Access control models have traditionally included mandatory access control (or lattice-based access control) and discretionary access control. Subsequently, role-based access control has been introduced, along with claims that its mechanisms are general enough to simulate the traditional methods. In this paper we provide systematic constructions for various common forms of both of the traditional access control paradigms using the role-based access control (RBAC) models of Sandhu et al., commonly called RBAC96. We see that all of the features of the RBAC96 model are required, and that although for the manatory access control simulation, only one administrative role needs to be assumed, for the discretionary access control simulations, a complex set of administrative roles is required."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22106","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22106","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22107","fieldValue":" We consider broadcast applications where the transmissions need to be encrypted, such as direct broadcast digital TV networks or Internet multicast. In these applications the number of encrypted TV programs may be very large, but the secure memory capacity at the set-top terminals (STT) is severely limited due to the need to withstand pirate attacks and hardware tampering. Despite this, we would like to allow the service provider to offer different packages of programs to the users. A user who buys a package should be able to view every program belonging to that package, but nothing else. A flexible scheme should allow for packages of various sizes to be offered, from a single program up to all the programs. We suggest two novel schemes to manage the encryption keys for these applications. The schemes are highly flexible, and understandable to users, yet require very few keys to be stored in the STTs' secure memory. The computational power required of the STTs is very low. The security of these schems is as good or better than that offered by current technology."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22107","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22107","fieldValue":"ACM"}
