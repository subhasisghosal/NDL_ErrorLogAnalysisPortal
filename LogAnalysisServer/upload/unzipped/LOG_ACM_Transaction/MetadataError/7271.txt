Two upper bounds on the individual session's queue length of LRD traffic under the generalized processor sharing (GPS) scheduling discipline are then contributed. It is shown that the index parameter in the upper bound of one LRD flow, (in addition to the decay rate and the asymptotic constant), may be affected by other LRD flows. A new concept, called LRD isolation, is subsequently contributed and accompanying it, a new technique is contributed to check whether a flow, with a given GPS weight assignment, can be guaranteed to be LRD isolated. This technique is also amenable for use in an online call admission control (CAC) scenario. When existing flows have already been assigned contract weights that cannot be changed, our technique can be used to determine minimum contract weights to be assigned to a new flow in order to guarantee the flow to be LRD isolated. The results are also extended to a PGPS (packet-based GPS) scheduler and relevant numerical results are provided to show the usefulness of our bounds and LRD isolation technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9360","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9360","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9360","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9361","fieldValue":" Pipelined ASIC architectures are increasingly being used in forwarding engines for high-speed IP routers. We explore optimization issues in the design of memory-efficient data structures that support fast incremental updates in such forwarding engines. Our solution aims to balance the memory utilization across the multiple pipeline stages. We also propose a series of optimizations that minimize the disruption to the forwarding process caused by route updates. These optimizations reduce the update overheads by over a factor of two for a variety of different core routing tables and update traces."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9361","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9361","fieldValue":"ACM"}
