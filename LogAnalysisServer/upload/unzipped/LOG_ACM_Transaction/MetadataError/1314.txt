Assuming the use of a ball-end cutter, we establish the conditions under which a surface is machinable by the cutter aligned in a certain direction, without the cutter's being obstructed by portions of the same surface. The set of such directions is represented on the sphere as a convex region, called the visibility map of the surface. By using the Gaussian maps and the visibility maps of the surfaces on a component, we can formulate the optimal workpiece orientation problems as geometric problems on the sphere. These and related geometric problems include finding a densest hemisphere that contains the largest subset of a given set of spherical polygons, determining a great circle that separates a given set of spherical polygons, computing a great circle that bisects a given set of spherical polygons, and finding a great circle that intersects the largest or the smallest subset of a set of spherical polygons. We show how all possible ways of intersecting a set of n spherical polygons with v total number of vertices by a great circle can be computed in O(vn log n) time and represented as a spherical partition. By making use of this representation, we present efficient algorithms for solving the five geometric problems on the sphere."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15083","fieldValue":"Separating and intersecting spherical polygons: computing machinability on three-, four-, and five-axis numerically controlled machines"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15084","fieldValue":" In this article, we characterize the solution space of low-degree, implicitly defined, algebraic surfaces which interpolate and\/or least-squares approximate a collection of scattered point and curve data in three-dimensional space. The problem of higher-order interpolation and least-squares approximation with algebraic surfaces under a proper normalization reduces to a quadratic minimization problem with elegant and easily expressible solutions. We have implemented our algebraic surface-fitting algorithms, and included them in the distributed and collaborative geometric environment SHASTRA. Several examples are given to illustrate how our algorithms are applied to algebraic surface design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15084","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15084","fieldValue":"ACM"}
