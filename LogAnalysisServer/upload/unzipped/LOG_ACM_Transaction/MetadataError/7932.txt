{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10679","fieldValue":" The effective end-to-end transport of delay-sensitive voice data has long been a problem in multimedia networking. One of the major issues is determining the sending rate of real-time VoIP streams such that the user experience is maximized per unit network resource consumed. A particularly interesting complication that remains to be addressed is that the available bandwidth is often dynamic. Thus, it is unclear whether a marginal increase warrants better user experience. If a user naively tunes the sending rate to the optimum at any given opportunity, the user experience could fluctuate. To investigate the effects of magnitude and frequency of rate changes on user experience, we recruited 127 human participants to systematically score emulated Skype calls with different combinations of rate changes, including varying magnitude and frequency of rate changes. Results show that: 1) the rate change frequency affects the user experience on a logarithmic scale, echoing Weber-Fechner's Law; 2) the effect of rate change magnitude depends on how users perceive the quality difference; and 3) this study derives a closed-form model of user perception for rate changes for Skype calls."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10679","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10679","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10679","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10680","fieldValue":" We evaluate the end-to-end delay of a multihop transmission scheme that includes a source, a number of relays, and a destination, in the presence of interferers located according to a Poisson point process. The medium access control (MAC) protocol considered is a combination of TDMA and ALOHA, according to which nodes located a certain number of hops apart are allowed to transmit with a certain probability. Based on an independent transmissions assumption, which decouples the queue evolutions, our analysis provides explicit expressions for the mean end-to-end delay and throughput, as well as scaling laws when the interferer density grows to infinity. If the source always has packets to transmit, we find that full spatial reuse, i.e., ALOHA, is asymptotically delay-optimal, but requires more hops than a TDMA-ALOHA protocol. The results of our analysis have applications in delay-minimizing joint MAC\/routing algorithms for networks with randomly located nodes.We simulate a network where sources and relays form a Poisson point process, and each source assembles a route to its destination by selecting the relays closest to the optimal locations. We assess both theoretically and via simulation the sensitivity of the end-to-end delay with respect to imperfect relay placements and route crossings."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10680","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10680","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10680","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10681","fieldValue":" Many existing fluid-flow models of the Internet congestion control algorithms make simplifying assumptions on the effects of buffers on the data flows. In particular, they assume that the flow rate of a TCP flow at every link in its path is equal to the original source rate. However, a fluid flow in practice is modified by the queueing processes on its path, so that an intermediate link will generally not see the original source rate. In this paper, a more accurate model is derived for the behavior of the network under a congestion controller, which takes into account the effect of buffering on output flows. It is shown how this model can be deployed for some well-known service disciplines such as first-in-first-out and generalized weighted fair queueing. Based on the derived model, the dual and primal-dual algorithms are studied under the common pricing mechanisms, and it is shown that these algorithms can become unstable. Sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the stability of the dual and primal-dual algorithms. Finally, a new pricing mechanism is proposed under which these congestion control algorithms are both stable."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10681","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
