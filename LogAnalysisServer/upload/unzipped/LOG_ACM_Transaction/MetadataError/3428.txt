{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21242","fieldValue":" In this article, we formalize the concept of tracking in a sensor network and develop a quantitative theory of trackability of weak models that investigates the rate of growth of the number of consistent tracks given a temporal sequence of observations made by the sensor network. The phenomenon being tracked is modelled by a nondeterministic finite automaton (a weak model) and the sensor network is modelled by an observer capable of detecting events related, typically ambiguously, to the states of the underlying automaton. Formally, an input string of symbols (the sensor network observations) that is presented to a nondeterministic finite automaton, M, (the weak model) determines a set of state sequences (the tracks or hypotheses) that are capable of generating the input string. We study the growth of the size of this candidate set of tracks as a function of the length of the input string. One key result is that for a given automaton and sensor coverage, the worst-case rate of growth is either polynomial or exponential in the number of observations, indicating a kind of phase transition in tracking accuracy. These results have applications to various tracking problems of recent interest involving tracking phenomena using noisy observations of hidden states such as: sensor networks, computer network security, autonomic computing and dynamic social network analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21242","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21243","fieldValue":" We address the problem of optimal node activation in a sensor network, where the optimization objective is represented as a global time-average utility function over the deployment area of the network. Each sensor node is rechargeable, and can hold up to K quanta of energy. When the recharge and\/or discharge processes in the network are random, the problem of optimal sensor activation is a complex stochastic decision question. For the case of identical sensor coverages, we show the existence of a simple threshold policy which is asymptotically optimal with respect to the energy bucket size K, that is, the performance of this threshold policy approaches the optimal performance as K becomes large. We also show that the performance of the optimal threshold policy is robust to the degree of spatial correlation in the discharge and\/or recharge processes. We then extend this approach to a general sensor network where coverage areas of different sensors could have complete, partial or no overlap with each other. We demonstrate through simulations that a local information based threshold policy, with an appropriately chosen threshold, achieves a performance which is very close to the global optimum."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3025","fieldValue":" The growing need for text mining systems, such as opinion mining, requires a deep semantic understanding of the target language. In order to accomplish this, extracting the semantic information of functional expressions plays a crucial role, because functional expressions such as would like to and canâ\u20AC™t are key expressions to detecting customersâ\u20AC™ needs and wants. However, in Japanese, functional expressions appear in the form of suffixes, and two different types of functional expressions are merged into one predicate: one influences the factual meaning of the predicate while the other is merely used for discourse purposes. This triggers an increase in surface forms, which hinders information extraction systems. In this article, we present a novel normalization technique that paraphrases complex functional expressions into simplified forms that retain only the crucial meaning of the predicate. We construct paraphrasing rules based on linguistic theories in syntax and semantics. The results of experiments indicate that our system achieves a high accuracy of 79.7&percnt;, while it reduces the differences in functional expressions by up to 66.7&percnt;. The results also show an improvement in the performance of predicate extraction, providing encouraging evidence of the usability of paraphrasing as a means of normalizing different language expressions."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3025","fieldValue":"Normalizing Complex Functional Expressions in Japanese Predicates: Linguistically-Directed Rule-Based Paraphrasing and Its Application"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3025","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3025","fieldValue":"ACM"}
