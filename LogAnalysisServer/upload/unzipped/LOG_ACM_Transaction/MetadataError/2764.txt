These experiments use the SPRITE (Single Point Ramped Imaging with $T_1$ Enhancement) method and multiple-point acquisition, sampling data in a nonuniform manner that prohibits reconstruction by fast Fourier transform. The chirp z-transform algorithm of Rabiner, Schafer, and Rader can be combined with phase corrections to compute the DFT of this data to extremely high accuracy. This algorithm outperforms the interpolation methods that are traditionally used to process nonuniform data, both in terms of execution time and in terms of accuracy as compared to the DFT."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19171","fieldValue":"MRI"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19171","fieldValue":"SPRITE"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19172","fieldValue":" We investigate the compilation of general multilinear variational forms over affines simplices and prove a representation theorem for the representation of the element tensor (element stiffness matrix) as the contraction of a constant reference tensor and a geometry tensor that accounts for geometry and variable coefficients. Based on this representation theorem, we design an algorithm for efficient pretabulation of the reference tensor. The new algorithm has been implemented in the FEniCS Form Compiler (FFC) and improves on a previous loop-based implementation by several orders of magnitude, thus shortening compile-times and development cycles for users of FFC."}
