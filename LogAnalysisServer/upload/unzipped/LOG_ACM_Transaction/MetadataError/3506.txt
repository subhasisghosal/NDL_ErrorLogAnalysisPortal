This article focuses on reducing idle-listening time via a dynamic duty-cycling technique which aims at optimizing the sleep interval between consecutive wake-ups. We considered a receiver-initiated MAC method for WSNs in which the sender waits for a beacon signal from the receiver before starting to transmit. Since each sender receives beacon signals from several nodes, the data are routed on multiple paths in a data collection network. In this context, we propose an optimization framework for minimizing the energy waste of the most power-hungry node of the network. To this aim, we first derive an analytic model that predicts nodes' energy consumption. Then, we use the model to derive a distributed optimization technique. Simulation results via NS-2 simulator are included to illustrate the accuracy of the model, and numerical results assess the validity of the proposed scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21440","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21440","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21441","fieldValue":"Abu-Ghazaleh, Nael B."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21441","fieldValue":" Visual sensor networks (VSNs) are becoming increasingly popular in a number of application domains. A distinguishing characteristic of VSNs is to self-configure to minimize the need for operator control and to improve scalability. One of the areas of self-configuration is camera coverage control that is, how should cameras adjust their field-of-views to cover maximum targets&quest; This is an NP-hard problem. We show that the existing heuristics have a number of weaknesses that influence both coverage and overhead. Therefore, we first propose a computationally efficient centralized heuristic that provides near-optimal coverage for small-scale networks. However, it requires significant communication and computation overhead, making it unsuitable for large-scale networks. Thus, we develop a distributed algorithm that outperforms the existing distributed algorithm with lower communication overhead, at the cost of coverage accuracy. We show that the proposed heuristics guarantee to cover at least half of the targets covered by the optimal solution. Finally, to gain benefits of both centralized and distributed algorithms, we propose a hierarchical algorithm where cameras are decomposed into neighborhoods that coordinate their coverage using an elected local coordinator. We observe that the hierarchical algorithm provides scalable near-optimal coverage with networking cost significantly less than that of centralized and distributed solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21441","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21441","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21442","fieldValue":"Yen, Li-Hsing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21442","fieldValue":"Lin, Che-Ming"}
