But how far should we accept promises of privacy in the face of personalized profiling? In particular, we ask how we can improve detection of sensitive topic profiling by online systems. We propose a definition of privacy disclosure that we call &epsiv;-indistinguishability, from which we construct scalable, practical tools to assess the learning potential from personalized content. We demonstrate our results using openly available resources, detecting a learning rate in excess of 98&percnt; for a range of sensitive topics during our experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20833","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose Segugio, a novel defense system that allows for efficiently tracking the occurrence of new malware-control domain names in very large ISP networks. Segugio passively monitors the DNS traffic to build a machine-domain bipartite graph representing who is querying what. After labeling nodes in this query behavior graph that are known to be either benign or malware-related, we propose a novel approach to accurately detect previously unknown malware-control domains. We implemented a proof-of-concept version of Segugio and deployed it in large ISP networks that serve millions of users. Our experimental results show that Segugio can track the occurrence of new malware-control domains with up to 94&percnt; true positives (TPs) at less than 0.1&percnt; false positives (FPs). In addition, we provide the following results: (1) we show that Segugio can also detect control domains related to new, previously unseen malware families, with 85&percnt; TPs at 0.1&percnt; FPs; (2) Segugioâ\u20AC™s detection models learned on traffic from a given ISP network can be deployed into a different ISP network and still achieve very high detection accuracy; (3) new malware-control domains can be detected days or even weeks before they appear in a large commercial domain-name blacklist; (4) Segugio can be used to detect previously unknown malware-infected machines in ISP networks; and (5) we show that Segugio clearly outperforms domain-reputation systems based on Belief Propagation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20833","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20833","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20834","fieldValue":" Rogue certificates are valid certificates issued by a legitimate certificate authority (CA) that are nonetheless untrustworthy; yet trusted by web browsers and users. With the current public key infrastructure, there exists a window of vulnerability between the time a rogue certificate is issued and when it is detected. Rogue certificates from recent compromises have been trusted for as long as weeks before detection and revocation. Previous proposals to close this window of vulnerability require changes in the infrastructure, Internet protocols, or end user experience. We present a method for detecting rogue certificates from trusted CAs developed from a large and timely collection of certificates. This method automates classification by building machine-learning models with Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Despite the scarcity of rogue instances in the dataset, DNN produced a classification method that is proven both in simulation and in the July 2014 compromise of the India CCA. We report the details of the classification method and illustrate that it is repeatable, such as with datasets obtained from crawling. We describe the classification performance under our current research deployment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20834","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20834","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20835","fieldValue":" We present Shallow MAC (ShMAC), a fixed-input-length message authentication code that performs most of the computation prior to the availability of the message. Specifically, ShMACâ\u20AC™s message-dependent computation is much faster and smaller in hardware than the evaluation of a pseudorandom permutation (PRP) and can be implemented by a small shallow circuit, while its precomputation consists of one PRP evaluation. A main building block for ShMAC is the notion of strong differential uniformity (SDU), which we introduce and which may be of independent interest. We show an efficient SDU construction built from previously considered differentially uniform functions. Our main motivating application is a system architecture where a hardware-secured processor uses memory controlled by an adversary. We also present in technical detail a novel, efficient approach to encrypting and authenticating memory and discuss the associated tradeoffs, while paying special attention to minimizing hardware costs and the reduction of Dynamic Random Access Memory latency."}
