Modeling bridge faults as delay faults helps delay tests to detect more bridge faults. Traditional bridge fault models are incomplete because these models only model the logic faults or these models are not efficient to use in delay tests for large circuits. In this article, we propose a physically realistic yet economical resistive bridge fault model to model delay faults as well as logic faults. An accurate yet simple delay calculation method is proposed. We also enumerate all possible fault behaviors and present the relationship between input patterns and output behaviors, which is useful in ATPG. Our fault simulation results show the benefit of at-speed tests."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12881","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12881","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12882","fieldValue":" Systems-on-Chips often contain a large amount of embedded memory. In order to obtain sufficiently high yield, efficient diagnosis and repair facilities are needed for the memories. A novel and efficient approach for collecting complete failure data during on-chip memory testing is proposed that can be combined with a row\/column reconfiguration algorithm for complete on-chip memory repair. A sequence of diagnostic tests of linear order is utilized that detects and localizes all cells involved in single-cell faults and two-cell coupling faults, such as idempotent coupling faults, and provides this information to on-chip circuitry for memory repair. Failure data are collected at the operating speed of the memory-under-test so that tests can be applied at speed. The data acquisition circuitry evaluates the test results and classifies faults as column failures, coupling faults, or single-cell faults for near-optimal allocation of spare resources. The proposed test and data acquisition algorithm can be realized as compact Built-In Self-Test (BIST) circuitry using standard design libraries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12882","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12882","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2226","fieldValue":" A feedback vertex set (fvs) of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal results in an acyclic graph.
