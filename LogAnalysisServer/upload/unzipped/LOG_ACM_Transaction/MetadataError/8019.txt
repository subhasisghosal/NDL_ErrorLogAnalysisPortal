{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10858","fieldValue":" Lately, there has been an upsurge of interest in compressed data structures, aiming to pack ever larger quantities of information into constrained memory without sacrificing the efficiency of standard operations, like random access, search, or update. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate how data compression can benefit the networking community by showing how to squeeze the IP Forwarding Information Base (FIB), the giant table consulted by IP routers to make forwarding decisions, into information-theoretical entropy bounds, with essentially zero cost on longest prefix match and FIB update. First, we adopt the state of the art in compressed data structures, yielding a static entropy-compressed FIB representation with asymptotically optimal lookup. Then, we redesign the venerable prefix tree, used commonly for IP lookup for at least 20 years in IP routers, to also admit entropy bounds and support lookup in optimal time and update in nearly optimal time. Evaluations on a Linux kernel prototype indicate that our compressors encode an FIB comprising more than 440 K prefixes to just about 100-400 kB of memory, with a threefold increase in lookup throughput and no penalty on FIB updates."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10858","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10858","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10858","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10859","fieldValue":" We consider a distributed multiuser system where individual entities possess observations or perceptions of one another, while the truth is only known to themselves and they might have an interest in withholding or distorting the truth. We ask the question whether it is possible for the system as a whole to arrive at the correct perceptions or assessment of all users, referred to as their reputation, by encouraging or incentivizing the users to participate in a collective effort without violating private information and self-interest. In this paper, we investigate this problem using a mechanism design theoretic approach. We introduce a number of utility models representing users' strategic behavior, each consisting of one or both of a truth element and an image element, reflecting the user's desire to obtain an accurate view of others and an inflated image of itself. For each model, we either design a mechanism that achieves the optimal performance (solution to the corresponding centralized problem), or present individually rational suboptimal solutions. In the latter case, we demonstrate that even when the centralized solution is not achievable, by using a simple punish-reward mechanism, not only does a user have the incentive to participate and provide information, but also that this information can improve the system performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10859","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10860","fieldValue":" The problem of online packet scheduling with hard deadlines has been studied extensively in the single-hop setting, whereas it is notoriously difficult in the multihop setting. This difficulty stems from the fact that packet scheduling decisions at each hop influence and are influenced by decisions on other hops, and only a few provably efficient online scheduling algorithms exist in the multihop setting. We consider a multihop wired network (interference-free and full duplex transmissions) in which packets with various deadlines and weights arrive at and are destined to different nodes through given routes. We study the problem of joint admission control and packet scheduling in order to maximize the cumulative weights of the packets that reach their destinations within their deadlines. We first focus on uplink transmissions in the tree topology and show that the well-known Earliest Deadline First algorithm achieves the same performance as the optimal offline algorithm for any feasible arrival pattern. We then address the general topology with multiple source-destination pairs, develop a simple online algorithm, and show that it is O(PM log PM)-competitive, where PM is the maximum route length among all packets. Our algorithm only requires information along the route of each packet, and our result is valid for general arrival samples. Moreover, we show that O(PM log PM)-competitive is the best any online algorithm can do. Via numerical results, we also show that our algorithm achieves performance that is comparable to the noncausal optimal offline algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with a provable (based on a sample-path construction) competitive ratio, subject to hard deadline constraints for general network topologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10860","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
