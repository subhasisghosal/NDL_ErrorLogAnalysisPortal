{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3924","fieldValue":" The emerging demand for personalized hearing aids requires the filter bank of a hearing aid system to be capable of decomposing the sound waves in accordance with the characteristic of the patient's hearing loss. In this paper, an efficient adjustable filter bank is proposed to achieve this goal. By careful design, the number of the subbands as well as the location of the subbands can be easily adjusted by changing a 4-bit control signal. The proposed filter bank has extremely low complexity due to the adoption of fractional interpolation and the technique of symmetric and complementary filters. Only one prototype filter is needed for each of the stages, the multiple passbands generation stage and masking stage. We show, by means of examples, that the proposed filter bank can meet different needs of hearing loss cases with acceptable delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3924","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3924","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3925","fieldValue":"Perez-Carrillo, Alfonso"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3925","fieldValue":" Acquisition of instrumental gestures in musical performances is a field of increasing interest with applications in different areas ranging from acoustics and sound synthesis to motor learning or artistic performances. Direct acquisition approaches are based on measurements with sensors attached on the instrument or the performer, a process that usually involves the use of expensive sensing systems and complex setups that are generally intrusive in practice. An alternative is the indirect acquisition without sensors based on analysis of the audio signal. This paper reports a novel indirect acquisition method for the estimation of continuous violin controls from audio-signal analysis based on the training of statistical models with a database of previously recorded violin performances. The database contains synchronized streams of audio features and instrumental controls. Audio signal was captured with a vibration transducer built into the violin bridge, and instrumental controls were measured with sensors. The controls include bowing parameters (played string, bowing velocity, bowing force, and bowing distance to the bridge) as well as fingering position. Once the model is trained for a specific violin, we can perform indirect acquisition from analysis of the signal captured with its embedded transducer without the need for the sensors any more. The statistical methods used are Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with observation distributions parameterized as Multivariate Gaussian Mixtures (GM). HMMs provide a means for note recognition and following and parameter prediction is based on GM regression. Results show that the presented method constitutes an accurate, non-intrusive and low-cost alternative for instrumental control acquisition of a previously calibrated violin and recording device."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3925","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3926","fieldValue":" In this paper, we improve morph-based speech recognition system by focusing adaptation efforts on acronyms (ACRs) and foreign proper names (FPNs). An unsupervised language model (LM) adaptation framework based on two-pass decoding is used. Vocabulary adaptation is applied alongside unsupervised LM adaptation. The aim is to improve both language and pronunciation modeling for FPNs and ACRs. A smart selection algorithm is used to find the most likely topically related foreign words and acronyms from in-domain text. New pronunciation rules are generated for the selected words. Different kinds of morpheme adaptation operations are also evaluated on the ACR and FPN candidate words, to ensure optimal results are gained from pronunciation adaptation. Statistically significant improvements in average word error rate (WER), and term error rate (TER), are achieved using a combination of unsupervised LM adaptation with vocabulary adaptation focused on ACRs and FPNs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3926","fieldValue":"ACM"}
