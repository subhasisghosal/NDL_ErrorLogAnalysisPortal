The absence of established standards has hindered the adoption of real-time scheduling solutions in this class of applications. Developers have adopted a wide range of heuristic approaches to achieve an acceptable timing behavior but the result is often unreliable. We propose a mechanism to extend the benefits of real-time scheduling to legacy applications based on the combination of two techniques: (1) a real-time monitor that observes and infers the activation period of the application, and (2) a feedback mechanism that adapts the scheduling parameters to improve its real-time performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6593","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6593","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6594","fieldValue":" Over the last decade, there has been an increasing emphasis on driver-assistance systems for the automotive domain. In this article, we report our work on designing a camera-based surveillance system embedded in a â\u20ACœsmartâ\u20AC? car door. Such a camera is used to monitor the ambient environment outside the car, for instance, the presence of obstacles such as approaching cars or cyclists who might collide with the car door if openedâ\u20AC\u201Dand automatically control the car door operations. This is an enhancement to the currently available side-view mirrors that the driver\/passenger checks before opening the car door. The focus of this article is on fast and robust image processing algorithms specifically targeting such a smart car door system. The requirement is to quickly detect traffic objects of interest from grayscale images captured by omnidirectional cameras. While known algorithms for object extraction from the image processing literature rely on color information and are sensitive to shadows and illumination changes, our proposed algorithms are highly robust, can operate on grayscale images (color images are not available in our setup), and output results in real time. We present a number of experimental results based on image sequences captured from real-life traffic scenarios to demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6594","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6594","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1605","fieldValue":" Excessive power consumption is widely considered as a major impediment to designing future microprocessors. With the continued scaling down of threshold voltages, the power consumed due to leaky memory cells in on-chip caches will constitute a significant portion of the processor's power budget. This work focuses on reducing the leakage energy consumed in the instruction cache using a compiler-directed approach.We present and analyze two compiler-based strategies termed as conservative and optimistic. The conservative approach does not put a cache line into a low leakage mode until it is certain that the current instruction in it is dead. On the other hand, the optimistic approach places a cache line in low leakage mode if it detects that the next access to the instruction will occur only after a long gap. We evaluate different optimization alternatives by combining the compiler strategies with state-preserving and state-destroying leakage control mechanisms. We also evaluate the sensitivity of these optimizations to different high-level compiler transformations, energy parameters, and soft errors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1605","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1605","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6595","fieldValue":"Gordon-Ross, Ann"}
