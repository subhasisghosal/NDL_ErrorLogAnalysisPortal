We present an integrated visualization and analysis framework that supports user-guided data clustering to aid exploration of these new complex data sets. The interplay of data visualization and clustering-based data classification leads to improved visualization and enables a more detailed analysis than previously possible. We discuss 1) the integration of data clustering and visualization into one framework, 2) the application of data clustering to 3D gene expression data, 3) the evaluation of the number of clusters k in the context of 3D gene expression clustering, and 4) the improvement of overall analysis quality via dedicated postprocessing of clustering results based on visualization. We discuss the use of this framework to objectively define spatial pattern boundaries and temporal profiles of genes and to analyze how mRNA patterns are controlled by their regulatory transcription factors."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4467","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4467","fieldValue":"Bioinformatics visualization, multimodal visualization, integrating Infovis\/Scivis, visual data mining, three-dimensional gene expression, data clustering, cluster visualization, gene expression pattern, temporal expression variation, gene regulation, spatial expression pattern."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4468","fieldValue":"Barcellos-Hoff, Mary Helen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4468","fieldValue":" Cell membrane proteins play an important role in tissue architecture and cell-cell communication. We hypothesize that segmentation and multidimensional characterization of the distribution of cell membrane proteins, on a cell-by-cell basis, enable improved classification of treatment groups and identify important characteristics that can otherwise be hidden. We have developed a series of computational steps to 1) delineate cell membrane protein signals and associate them with a specific nucleus; 2) compute a coupled representation of the multiplexed DNA content with membrane proteins; 3) rank computed features associated with such a multidimensional representation; 4) visualize selected features for comparative evaluation through heatmaps; and 5) discriminate between treatment groups in an optimal fashion. The novelty of our method is in the segmentation of the membrane signal and the multidimensional representation of phenotypic signature on a cell-by-cell basis. To test the utility of this method, the proposed computational steps were applied to images of cells that have been irradiated with different radiation qualities in the presence and absence of other small molecules. These samples are labeled for their DNA content and E-cadherin membrane proteins. We demonstrate that multidimensional representations of cell-by-cell phenotypes improve predictive and visualization capabilities among different treatment groups, and identify hidden variables."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4468","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4468","fieldValue":"Multidimensional profiling, evolving fronts, Voronoi tessellation, iterative scalar voting, E-cadherin, ionizing radiation."}
