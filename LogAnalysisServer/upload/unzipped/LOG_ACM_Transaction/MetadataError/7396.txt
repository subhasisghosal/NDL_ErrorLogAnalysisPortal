It has been widely recognized that multipath routing can be fundamentally more efficient than the traditional approach of routing along single paths. Yet, in contrast to the single-path routing approach, most studies in the context of multipath routing focused on heuristic methods. We demonstrate the significant advantage of optimal (or near optimal) solutions. Hence, we investigate multipath routing adopting a rigorous (theoretical) approach. We formalize problems that incorporate two major requirements of multipath routing. Then, we establish the intractability of these problems in terms of computational complexity. Finally, we establish efficient solutions with proven performance guarantees."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9603","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9603","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9603","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9604","fieldValue":" We study the problem of disseminating a piece of information through all the nodes of a network, given that it is known originally only to a single node. In the absence of any structural knowledge on the network, other than the nodes' neighborhoods, this problem is traditionally solved by flooding all the network's edges. We analyze a recently introduced probabilistic algorithm for flooding and give an alternative probabilistic heuristic that can lead to some cost-effective improvements, like better trade-offs between the message and time complexities involved. We analyze the two algorithms, both mathematically and by means of simulations, always within a random-graph framework and considering relevant node-degree distributions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9604","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9604","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9604","fieldValue":"ACM"}
