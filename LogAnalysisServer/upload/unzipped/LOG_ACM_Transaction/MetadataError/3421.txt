In this article, we propose a canonical seed assignment model for key predistribution characterizing seed assignment in terms of the probability distribution describing the number of nodes receiving each seed and the algorithm for seed assignment. In addition, we present a sampling framework for seed assignment algorithms in the canonical model. We propose a probabilistic k-connectivity model for randomly deployed secure networks using spatial statistics and geometric random graph theory. We analyze key predistribution schemes in the canonical model in terms of network connectivity and resilience to node capture. The analytical results can be used to determine the average or worst-case connectivity or resilience to node capture for a key predistribution scheme. Furthermore, we demonstrate the design of new key predistribution schemes and the inclusion of existing schemes in the canonical model. Finally, we present a general approach to analyze the addition of nodes to an existing secure network and derive results for a well-known scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21223","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21223","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21224","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks have recently been suggested for many surveillance applications, such as object monitoring, path protection, or area coverage. Since the sensors themselves are important and critical objects in the network, a natural question is whether they need certain level of protection, so as to resist the attacks targeting on them directly. If this is necessary, then who should provide this protection, and how it can be done&quest; We refer to the above problem as self-protection, as we believe the sensors themselves are the best (and often the only) candidates to provide such protection. In this article, we for the first time present a formal study on the self-protection problems in wireless sensor networks. We show that, if we simply focus on enhancing the quality of field or object covering, the sensors might not necessarily be self-protected, which in turn makes the system extremely vulnerable. We then investigate different forms of self-protections, and show that the problems are generally NP-complete. We develop efficient approximation algorithms for centrally controlled sensors. We further extend the algorithms to fully distributed implementation, and introduce a smart sleep-scheduling algorithm that minimizes the energy consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21224","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21224","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21225","fieldValue":" We consider sensors, such as fibers, lasers, and pyroelectric motion detectors, that fire when objects cross a boundary. A moving object can be localized by analyzing sequences of boundary crossings. We consider the number of distinct sequences and object positions that can be achieved using boundary sensors in one- and two-dimensional spaces. For 1D systems we use representations of sensor sequences on graphs to derive limits on the number of object locations that can be monitored by a given sensor population and sequence length. For 2D systems we show that in certain circumstances the ratio of the number of unique sensor sequences to the number of unique object paths is exponential in the sequence length and we argue that the probability of unique identification is high for sufficiently large sequences. We also prove the triangle grid can track an object with error limited to a small neighborhood."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21225","fieldValue":"ACM"}
