We then progress to present Holmes, a Hybrid Ontological and Learning MEdical System which supports decision making about patient treatment. This system is introduced in order to cope with the case of missing data. We demonstrate its effectiveness by operating on an extensive set of real-world patient health data from the CDC, applied to the decision-making scenario of administering sleeping pills. In particular, we clarify how the combination of semantic, ontological representations, and probabilistic reasoning together enable the proposal of effective patient treatments. Our focus is thus on presenting an approach for interpreting medical data in the context of real-time decision making. This constitutes a comprehensive framework for the design of medical recommendation systems for potential use by medical professionals and patients both, with the end result being personalized patient treatment. We conclude with a discussion of the value of our particular approach for such diverse considerations as coping with misinformation provided by patients, performing effectively in time-critical environments where real-time decisions are necessary, and potential applications facilitating patient information gathering."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7510","fieldValue":"Validation of an ontological medical decision support system for patient treatment using a repository of patient data: Insights into the value of machine learning"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7511","fieldValue":" Information processing of radiotherapy systems has become an important research area for sophisticated radiation treatment methodology. Geometrically precise delivery of radiotherapy in the thorax and upper abdomen is compromised by respiratory motion during treatment. Accurate prediction of the respiratory motion would be beneficial for improving tumor targeting. However, a wide variety of breathing patterns can make it difficult to predict the breathing motion with explicit models. We proposed a respiratory motion predictor, that is, customized prediction with multiple patient interactions using neural network (CNN). For the preprocedure of prediction for individual patient, we construct the clustering based on breathing patterns of multiple patients using the feature selection metrics that are composed of a variety of breathing features. In the intraprocedure, the proposed CNN used neural networks (NN) for a part of the prediction and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for a part of the correction. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method was investigated with a variety of prediction time horizons using normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) values in comparison with the alternate recurrent neural network (RNN). We have also evaluated the prediction accuracy using the marginal value that can be used as the reference value to judge how many signals lie outside the confidence level. The experimental results showed that the proposed CNN can outperform RNN with respect to the prediction accuracy with an improvement of 50&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7512","fieldValue":" Incremental tests are widely used in cardiopulmonary exercise testing, both in the clinical domain and in sport sciences. The highest workload (denoted $W_peak) reached in the test is key information for assessing the individual body response to the test and for analyzing possible cardiac failures and planning rehabilitation, and training sessions. Being physically very demanding, incremental tests can significantly increase the body stress on monitored individuals and may cause cardiopulmonary overload. This article presents a new approach to cardiopulmonary testing that addresses these drawbacks. During the test, our approach analyzes the individual body response to the exercise and predicts the Wpeak value that will be reached in the test and an evaluation of its accuracy. When the accuracy of the prediction becomes satisfactory, the test can be prematurely stopped, thus avoiding its entire execution. To predict Wpeak, we introduce a new index, the CardioPulmonary Efficiency Index (CPE), summarizing the cardiopulmonary response of the individual to the test. Our approach analyzes the CPE trend during the test, together with the characteristics of the individual, and predicts Wpeak. A K-nearest-neighbor-based classifier and an ANN-based classier are exploited for the prediction. The experimental evaluation showed that the Wpeak$ value can be predicted with a limited error from the first steps of the test."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7512","fieldValue":"ACM"}
