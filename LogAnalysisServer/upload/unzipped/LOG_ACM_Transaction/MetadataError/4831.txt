This is as true for creating professional content as it is for nonprofessional editors. During the past 20 years, authoring networked content has been a part of the research agenda of the multimedia community. Unfortunately, authoring has been seen as an initial enterprise that occurs before â\u20AC˜realâ\u20AC™ content processing takes place. This limits the options open to authors and to viewers of rich multimedia content for creating and receiving focused, highly personal media presentations. This article reflects on the history of multimedia authoring. We focus on the particular task of supporting socially-aware multimedia, in which the relationships within particular social groups among authors and viewers can be exploited to create highly personal media experiences. We provide an overview of the requirements and characteristics of socially-aware multimedia authoring within the context of exploiting community content. We continue with a short historical perspective on authoring support for these types of situations. We then present an overview of a current system for supporting socially-aware multimedia authoring within the community content. We conclude with a discussion of the issues that we feel can provide a fruitful basis for future multimedia authoring support. We argue that providing support for socially-aware multimedia authoring can have a profound impact on the nature and architecture of the entire multimedia information processing pipeline."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25517","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25517","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25518","fieldValue":" This article presents a comprehensive review and analysis on image search in the past 20 years, emphasizing the challenges and opportunities brought by the astonishing increase of dataset scales from thousands to billions in the same time period, which was witnessed first-hand by the authors as active participants in this research area. Starting with a retrospective review of three stages of image search in the history, the article highlights major breakthroughs around the year 2000 in image search features, indexing methods, and commercial systems, which marked the transition from stage two to stage three. Subsequent sections describe the image search research from four important aspects: system framework, feature extraction and image representation, indexing, and big data's potential. Based on the review, the concluding section discusses open research challenges and suggests future research directions in effective visual representation, image knowledge base construction, implicit user feedback and crowdsourcing, mobile image search, and creative multimedia interfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25519","fieldValue":" A panel at ACM Multimedia 2012 addressed research successes in the past 20 years. While the panel focused on the past, this article discusses successes since the ACM SIGMM 2003 Retreat and suggests research directions in the next ten years. While significant progress has been made, more research is required to allow multimedia to impact our everyday computing environment. The importance of hardware changes on future research directions is discussed. We believe ubiquitous computingâ\u20AC\u201Dmeaning abundant computation and network bandwidthâ\u20AC\u201Dshould be applied in novel ways to solve multimedia grand challenges and continue the IT revolution of the past century."}
