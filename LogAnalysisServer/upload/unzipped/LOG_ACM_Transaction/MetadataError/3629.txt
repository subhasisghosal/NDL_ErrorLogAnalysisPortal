Recently, more and more CSC systems have been proposed. To the best of our knowledge, language modeling is one of the major components among these systems because of its simplicity and moderately good predictive power. After deeply analyzing the school of research, we are aware that most of the systems only employ the conventional n-gram language models. The contributions of this article are threefold. First, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for CSC, which naturally combines several important components, such as the substitution model and the language model, to inherit their individual merits as well as to overcome their limitations. Second, we incorporate the topic language models into the CSC system in an unsupervised fashion. The topic language models can capture the long-span semantic information from a word (character) string while the conventional n-gram language models can only preserve the local regularity information. Third, we further integrate Web resources with the proposed framework to enhance the overall performance. Our rigorously empirical experiments demonstrate the consistent and utility performance of the proposed framework in the CSC task."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3081","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3081","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21765","fieldValue":"Smith, Alastair M"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21765","fieldValue":"Constantinides, George A"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21765","fieldValue":"Cheung, Peter Y K"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21765","fieldValue":" This paper argues the case for the use of analytical models in FPGA architecture exploration. We show that the problem, when simplified, is amenable to formal optimization techniques such as integer linear programming. However, the simplification process may lead to inaccurate models. To test the overall methodology, we feed the resulting architectures to VPR 5.0 and quantify their performance in comparison with traditional design methodologies. Our results show that the resulting architectures are better than those found using parameter sweep techniques. In addition, we show that these architectures can be further improved by combining the accuracy of VPR 5.0 with the efficiency of analytical techniques. This is achieved using a closed loop framework which iteratively refines the analytical model using the place and route outputs from VPR."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21765","fieldValue":"ILP"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21765","fieldValue":"VPR"}
