We model this problem as an online distributed motion planning problem. Each sensor node senses values in its perception space and has the ability to trigger exceptions events we call â\u20ACœdangerâ\u20AC? and model as â\u20ACœobstaclesâ\u20AC?. The danger\/obstacle landscape changes over time. We present algorithms for computing distributed maps in perception space and for using these maps to compute adaptive paths for a mobile node that can interact with the sensor network. We give the analysis to the protocol and report on hardware experiments using a physical sensor network consisting of Mote sensors. We also show how to reduce searching space and communication cost using Voronoi diagram."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21173","fieldValue":" An effective approach for energy conservation in wireless sensor networks is scheduling sleep intervals for extraneous nodes while the remaining nodes stay active to provide continuous service. For the sensor network to operate successfully, the active nodes must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity. Furthermore, the network must be able to configure itself to any feasible degree of coverage and connectivity in order to support different applications and environments with diverse requirements. This article presents the design and analysis of novel protocols that can dynamically configure a network to achieve guaranteed degrees of coverage and connectivity. This work differs from existing connectivity or coverage maintenance protocols in several key ways. (1) We present a Coverage Configuration Protocol (CCP) that can provide different degrees of coverage requested by applications. This flexibility allows the network to self-configure for a wide range of applications and (possibly dynamic) environments. (2) We provide a geometric analysis of the relationship between coverage and connectivity. This analysis yields key insights for treating coverage and connectivity within a unified framework; in sharp contrast to several existing approaches that address the two problems in isolation. (3) We integrate CCP with SPAN to provide both coverage and connectivity guarantees. (4) We propose a probabilistic coverage model and extend CCP to provide probabilistic coverage guarantees. We demonstrate the capability of our protocols to provide guaranteed coverage and connectivity configurations through both geometric analysis and extensive simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21173","fieldValue":"ACM"}
