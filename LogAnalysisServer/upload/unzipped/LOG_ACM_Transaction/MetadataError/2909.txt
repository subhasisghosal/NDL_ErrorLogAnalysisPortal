To utilize a Boolean query effectively, a mechanism to retrieve as many as possible relevant documents is therefore required. In accordance with this requirement, we propose a method for modifying a given Boolean query by using information from a relevant document set. The retrieval results, however, may deteriorate if some important query terms are removed by this reformulation. A further mechanism is thus required in order to use other query terms that are useful for finding more relevant documents, but are not strictly required in relevant documents. To meet this requirement, we propose a new method that combines the probabilistic IR and the Boolean IR models. We also introduce a new IR system---called appropriate Boolean query reformulation for information retrieval (ABRIR)---based on these two methods and the Okapi system. ABRIR uses both a word index and a phrase index formed from combinations of two adjacent noun words. The effectiveness of these two methods was confirmed according to the NTCIR-4 Web test collection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2885","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2885","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19497","fieldValue":" Portable parallel benchmarks are widely used for performance evaluation of HPC systems. However, because these are manually produced, they generally represent a greatly simplified view of application behavior, missing the subtle but important-to-performance nuances that may exist in a complete application. This work contributes novel methods to automatically generate highly portable and customizable communication benchmarks from HPC applications. We utilize ScalaTrace, a lossless yet scalable parallel-application tracing framework to collect selected aspects of the run-time behavior of HPC applications, including communication operations and computation time, while abstracting away the details of the computation proper. We subsequently generate benchmarks with nearly identical run-time behavior to the original applications. Results demonstrate that the generated benchmarks are in fact able to preserve the run-time behavior (including both the communication pattern and the execution time) of the original applications. Such automated benchmark generation is without precedent and particularly valuable for proprietary, export-controlled, or classified application codes."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19497","fieldValue":"A methodology for automatic generation of executable communication specifications from parallel MPI applications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19498","fieldValue":"Pouchet, Louis-Nol"}
