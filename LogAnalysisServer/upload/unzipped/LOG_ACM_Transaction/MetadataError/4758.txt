Most previous periodic broadcast protocols, however, assume that all clients can receive at the same rate, and also assume that reception bandwidth is not time-varying. In this article, we first develop a new periodic broadcast protocol, Optimized Heterogeneous Periodic Broadcast (OHPB), that can be optimized for a given population of clients with heterogeneous reception bandwidths and quality-of-service requirements. The OHPB protocol utilizes an optimized segment size progression determined by solving a linear optimization model that takes as input the client population characteristics and an objective function such as mean client startup delay. We then develop a generalization of the OHPB linear optimization model that allows optimal server bandwidth allocation among multiple concurrent OHPB broadcasts, wherein each media file and its clients may have different characteristics. Finally, we propose complementary client protocols employing work-ahead buffering of data during playback, so as to enable more uniform playback quality when the reception bandwidth is time-varying."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25331","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25331","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25332","fieldValue":"Kim, Jin-Soo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25332","fieldValue":" NAND flash memory has become one of the most popular storage media for mobile multimedia systems. A key issue in designing storage systems for mobile multimedia systems is handling large-capacity storage media and numerous large files with limited resources such as memory. However, existing flash file systems, including JFFS2 and YAFFS in particular, exhibit many limitations in addressing the storage capacity of mobile multimedia systems. In this article, we design and implement a scalable flash file system, called ScaleFFS, for mobile multimedia systems. ScaleFFS is designed to require only a small fixed amount of memory space and to provide fast mount time, even if the file system size grows to more than tens of gigabytes. The measurement results show that ScaleFFS can be instantly mounted regardless of the file system size, while achieving the same write bandwidth and up to 22&percnt; higher read bandwidth compared to JFFS2."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25332","fieldValue":"NAND"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25332","fieldValue":"ACM"}
