Using ideas from Information Theory, we present a computationally simple and theoretically justified method for assigning scores to candidate expansion terms. Such scores are used to select and weight expansion terms within Rocchio's framework for query reweigthing. We compare ranking with information-theoretic query expansion versus ranking with other query expansion techniques, showing that the former achieves better retrieval effectiveness on several performance measures. We also discuss the effect on retrieval effectiveness of the main parameters involved in automatic query expansion, such as data sparseness, query difficulty, number of selected documents, and number of selected terms, pointing out interesting relationships."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23827","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23827","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23828","fieldValue":"de Oliveira, Maria Cristina Ferreira"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23828","fieldValue":" This paper presents a formal definition for HMBS (Hypermedia Model Based on Statecharts). HMBS uses the structure and execution semantics of statecharts to specify both the structural organization and the browsing semantics of hypermedia applications. Statecharts are an extension of finite-state machines and the model is thus a generalization of hypergraph-based hypertext models. Some of the most important features of HMBS are its ability to model hierarchy and synchronization of information; provision of mechanisms for specifying access structures, navigational contexts, access control, multiple tailored versions,and hierarchical views. Analysis of the underlying statechart machine allows verification of page reachability, valid paths, and other properties, thus providing mechanisms to support authors in the development of structured applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23828","fieldValue":"HMBS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23828","fieldValue":"ACM"}
