However, as technology shrinks transistor sizes, single and multiple bit upsets only observable in space applications previously are now reported at ground level. This article presents a high level technique to protect SRAM memories against multiple upsets based on correcting codes. The proposed technique combines Reed Solomon code and Hamming code to assure reliability in presence of multiple bit flips with reduced area and performance penalties. Multiple upsets were randomly injected in various combinations of memory cells to evaluate the robustness of the method. The experiment was emulated in a Virtex FPGA platform. Results show that 100&percnt; of the injected double faults and a large amount of multiple faults were corrected by the method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12883","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12883","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12884","fieldValue":" This article describes a polynomial time algorithm for min-area retiming for edge-triggered circuits to handle both setup and hold constraints. Given a circuit G and a target clock period c, our algorithm either outputs a retimed version of G satisfying setup and hold constraints or reports that such a solution is not possible, in $O(&mid;V&mid;^3$log&mid;V&mid;log(&mid;V&mid;C)) steps, where &mid;V&mid; corresponds to number of gates in the circuit and C is equal to the number of registers in the circuit. This is the first polynomial-time algorithm ever reported for min-area retiming with constraints on both long and short-paths. An alternative problem formulation that takes practical issues into consideration and lowers the problem complexity is also developed. Both the problem formulations have many parallels with the original formulation of long path only retiming by Leiserson and Saxe and all the speed improvements that have been obtained on that problem statement are also demonstrated in simulation for the approach presented here. Finally, a basis is provided for deriving efficient heuristics for addressing both long-path and short-path requirements by combining the techniques of retiming and min-delay padding."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12884","fieldValue":"A new approach for integration of min-area retiming and min-delay padding for simultaneously addressing short-path and long-path constraints"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12884","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12884","fieldValue":"ACM"}
