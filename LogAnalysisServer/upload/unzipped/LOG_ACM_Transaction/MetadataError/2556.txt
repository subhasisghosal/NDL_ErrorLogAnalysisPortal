An initial separator is first obtained from the minimum degree ordering, an algorithm designed originally to produce fill-reducing orderings for sparse matrices. The separator is then improved by an iterative strategy based on some known results from bipartite graph matching. This gives an overall practical scheme in partitioning graphs. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this heuristic algorithm on graphs arising from sparse matrix applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18617","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18617","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/18618","fieldValue":"Mahdavi-Amiri, Nezam"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18618","fieldValue":" This paper is concerned with the development, numerical implementation, and testing of an algorithm for solving constrained nonlinear least squares problems. The algorithm is an adaptation of the least squares case of an exact penalty method for solving nonlinearly constrained optimization problems due to Coleman and Conn. It also uses the ideas of Nocedal and Overton for handling quasi-Newton updates of projected Hessians, those of Dennis, Gay, and Welsch for approaching the structure of nonlinear least squares Hessians, and those of Murray and Overton for performing line searches. This method has been tested on a selection of problems listed in the collection of Hock and Schittkowski. The results indicate that the approach taken here is a viable alternative for least squares problems to the general nonlinear methods studied by Hock and Schittkowski."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18618","fieldValue":"Constrained nonlinear least squares: an exact penalty approach with projected structured quasi-Newton updates"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18619","fieldValue":" In this paper, codes are provided for two of the most popular square root filters: the Square Root Covariance Filter and the Square Root Information Filter.
