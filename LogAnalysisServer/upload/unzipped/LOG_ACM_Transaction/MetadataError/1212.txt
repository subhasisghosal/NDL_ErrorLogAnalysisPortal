MITOS extends the scope of resource management to the dynamic relocation of nomadic users: the system suggests to a user the best location to move to for obtaining a satisfactory quality of service level, when the controlling access point of its current location becomes congested. The system monitors the traffic and user location across the network, and formulates the appropriate relocation proposal urging specific users to move to better locations at reasonable distances. Two enhancements to the basic MITOS system are introduced for maintaining an almost uniform load level across the considered infrastructure: the first uses microeconomic concepts, while the second borrows game theoretic mechanisms from the Santa Fe Bar problem. Simulation results on the efficiency of the proposed schemes are provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1166","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1166","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2390","fieldValue":" We introduce a problem class we call Polynomial Constraint Satisfaction Problems, or PCSP. Where the usual CSPs from computer science and optimization have real-valued score functions, and partition functions from physics have monomials, PCSP has scores that are arbitrary multivariate formal polynomials, or indeed take values in an arbitrary ring. Although PCSP is much more general than CSP, remarkably, all (exact, exponential-time) algorithms we know of for 2-CSP (where each score depends on at most 2 variables) extend to 2-PCSP, at the expense of just a polynomial factor in running time. Specifically, we extend the reduction-based algorithm of Scott and Sorkin [2007]; the specialization of that approach to sparse random instances, where the algorithm runs in polynomial expected time; dynamic-programming algorithms based on tree decompositions; and the split-and-list matrix-multiplication algorithm of Williams [2004]. This gives the first polynomial-space exact algorithm more efficient than exhaustive enumeration for the well-studied problems of finding a maximum bisection of a graph, and calculating the partition function of an Ising model. It also yields the most efficient algorithm known for certain instances of counting and\/or weighted Maximum Independent Set. Furthermore, PCSP solves both optimization and counting versions of a wide range of problems, including all CSPs, and thus enables samplers including uniform sampling of optimal solutions and Gibbs sampling of all solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2390","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2390","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14613","fieldValue":"Kostylev, Egor V"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14613","fieldValue":"Reutter, Juan L"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14613","fieldValue":"Salamon, Andrs Z"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14613","fieldValue":" We study the problem of query containment of conjunctive queries over annotated databases. Annotations are typically attached to tuples and represent metadata, such as probability, multiplicity, comments, or provenance. It is usually assumed that annotations are drawn from a commutative semiring. Such databases pose new challenges in query optimization, since many related fundamental tasks, such as query containment, have to be reconsidered in the presence of propagation of annotations. We axiomatize several classes of semirings for each of which containment of conjunctive queries is equivalent to existence of a particular type of homomorphism. For each of these types, we also specify all semirings for which existence of a corresponding homomorphism is a sufficient (or necessary) condition for the containment. We develop new decision procedures for containment for some semirings which are not in any of these classes. This generalizes and systematizes previous approaches."}
