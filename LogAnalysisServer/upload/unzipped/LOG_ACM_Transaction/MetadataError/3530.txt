We consider the scenario where a physical quantity is constantly growing at certain rates at the POIs. A number of mobile agents are then deployed to periodically cover (sense or service) the POIs and keep the physical quantity under control bounded at all the POIs. We assume a communication-constrained operation, where the mobile agents need to communicate to a fixed remote station over realistic wireless links to complete their coverage task. We then propose novel mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) to design periodic trajectories and TX power policies for the mobile agents that minimize the total energy (the summation of motion and communication energy) consumption of the mobile agents in each period, while (1) guaranteeing the boundedness of the quantity of interest at all the POIs, and (2) meeting the constraints on the connectivity of the mobile agents, the frequency of covering the POIs, and the total energy budget of the mobile agents. We furthermore provide a probabilistic analysis of the problem. Our results show the superior performance of the proposed framework for dynamic coverage in realistic fading environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21495","fieldValue":"Dynamic Networked Coverage of Time-Varying Environments in the Presence of Fading Communication Channels"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21496","fieldValue":" Link quality estimation is a fundamental component of the low-power wireless network protocols and is essential for routing protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task due to the notoriously dynamic and unpredictable wireless environment. In this article we argue that, in addition to the estimation of current link quality, prediction of the future link quality is more important for the routing protocol to establish low-cost delivery paths. We propose to apply machine learning methods to predict the link quality in the near future to facilitate the utilization of intermediate links with frequent quality changes. Moreover, we show that, by using online learning methods, our adaptive link estimator (TALENT) adapts to network dynamics better than statically trained models without the need of a priori data collection for training the model before deployment. We implemented TALENT in TinyOS with Low-Power Listening (LPL) and conducted extensive experiments in three testbeds. Our experimental results show that the addition of TALENT increases the delivery efficiency 1.95 times on average compared with a 4B, state-of-the-art link quality estimator, as well as improves the end-to-end delivery rate when tested on three different wireless testbeds."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21497","fieldValue":"Lavalle, Steven M"}
