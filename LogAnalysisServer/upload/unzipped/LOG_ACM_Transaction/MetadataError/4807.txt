Diverse styles of brush strokes have previously been adopted for different areas of an image to create aesthetically pleasing textures and shading. Because there is no continuous tone within these types of images, a multilevel scheme is proposed, which uses different textures based on a threshold level. These textures are then applied to the different levels and are then combined to build up the final hatched image. The proposed technique allows a secret to be hidden using Visual Cryptography (VC) within the hatched images. Visual cryptography provides a very powerful means by which one secret can be distributed into two or more pieces known as shares. When the shares are superimposed exactly together, the original secret can be recovered without computation. Also provided is a comparison between the original grayscale images and the resulting hatched images that are generated by the proposed algorithm. This reinforces that the overall quality of the hatched scheme is sufficient. The Structural SIMilarity index (SSIM) is used to perform this comparison."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25459","fieldValue":" Video watermarking has received much attention over the past years as a promising solution to copy protection. Watermark robustness is still a key issue of research, especially when a watermark is embedded in the compressed video domain. In this article, a robust watermarking scheme for H.264 video is proposed. During video encoding, the watermark is embedded in the index of the reference frame, referred to as reference index, a bitstream syntax element newly proposed in the H.264 standard. Furthermore, the video content (current coded blocks) is modified based on an optimization model, aiming at improving watermark robustness without unacceptably degrading the video's visual quality or increasing the video's bit rate. Compared with the existing schemes, our method has the following three advantages: (1) The bit rate of the watermarked video is adjustable; (2) the robustness against common video operations can be achieved; (3) the watermark embedding and extraction are simple. Extensive experiments have verified the good performance of the proposed watermarking scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25459","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25459","fieldValue":"ACM"}
