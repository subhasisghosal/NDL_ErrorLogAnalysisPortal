For the analysis, we often compare two protein structures, taking flexible regions like hinge regions into consideration. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) is the most popular measure for comparing two protein structures, but it is only for rigid structures without hinge regions. In this paper, we propose a new measure called RMSD considering hinges (RMSDh) and its variant {\\rm RMSDh}^{(k)} for comparing two flexible proteins with hinge regions. We also propose novel efficient algorithms for computing them, which can detect the hinge positions at the same time. The RMSDh is suitable for cases where there is one small hinge region in each of the two target structures. The new algorithm for computing the RMSDh runs in linear time, which is the same as the time complexity for computing the RMSD and is faster than any of previous algorithms for hinge detection. The {\\rm RMSDh}^{(k)} is designed for comparing structures with more than one hinge region. The {\\rm RMSDh}^{(k)} measure considers at most k small hinge region, i.e., the {\\rm RMSDh}^{(k)} value should be small if the two structures are similar except for at most k hinge regions. To compute the value, we propose an O(kn^{2})-time and O(n)-space algorithm based on a new dynamic programming technique. With the same computational time and space, we can enumerate the predicted hinge positions. We also test our algorithms against actual flexible protein structures, and show that the hinge positions can be correctly detected by our algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4494","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4494","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4494","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1346","fieldValue":" Distributed autonomous systems consisting of large numbers of components with no central control point need to be able to dynamically adapt their control mechanisms to deal with an unpredictable and changing environment. Existing frameworks for engineering self-adaptive systems fail to account for the need to incorporate self-expressionâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, the capability of a system to dynamically adapt its coordination pattern during runtime. Although the benefits of incorporating self-expression are well known, currently there is no principled means of enabling this during system design. We propose a conceptual framework for principled design of systems that exhibit self-expression, based on inspiration from the natural immune system. The framework is described as a set of design principles and customizable algorithms and then is instantiated in three case studies, including two from robotics and one from artificial chemistry. We show that it enables self-expression in each case, resulting in systems that are able to adapt their choice of coordination pattern during runtime to optimize functional and nonfunctional goals, as well as to discover novel patterns and architectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1346","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1346","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4495","fieldValue":" HASH(0x295276c)"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4495","fieldValue":" HASH(0x295276c)"}
