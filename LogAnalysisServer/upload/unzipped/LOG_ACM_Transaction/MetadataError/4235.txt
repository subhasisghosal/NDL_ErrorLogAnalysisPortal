Effective use of information systems to support office and service work can improve staff productivity, broaden a company's market, or dramatically change its business. It can also increase the extent to which work is computer mediated and thus within the reach of software known as Computerized Performance Monitoring and Control Systems (CPMCSs). Virtually all research has studied CPMCSs as unidimensional systems. Employees are described as â\u20ACœmonitoredâ\u20AC? or â\u20ACœunmonitoredâ\u20AC? or as subject to â\u20ACœhigh,â\u20AC? â\u20ACœmoderate,â\u20AC? or â\u20ACœlowâ\u20AC? levels of monitoring. Research that does not clearly distinguish among possible monitor design cannot explain how designs may differ in effect. Nor can it suggest how to design better monitors. A multidimensional view of CPMCSs describes monitor designs in terms of object of measurements, tasks measured, recipient of data, reporting period, and message content. This view is derived from literature in control systems, organizational behavior, and management information systems. The multidimensional view can then be incorporated into causal models to explain contradictory results of earlier CPMCS research."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23761","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23761","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23762","fieldValue":" We describe a prototype intelligent information retrieval system that uses natural-language understanding to efficiently locate captioned data. Multimedia data generally require captions to explain their features and significance. Such descriptive captions often rely on long nominal compounds (strings of consecutive nouns) which create problems of disambiguating word sence. In our system, captions and user queries are parsed and interpreted to produce a logical form using a detailed theory of the meaning of nominal compounds. A fine-grain match can then compare the logical form of the query to the logical forms for each caption. To improve system efficiency, we first perform a coarse-grain match with index files, using nouns and verbs extracted from the query. Our experiments with randomly selected queries and captions from an existing image library show an increase of 30% in precision and 50% in recall over the keyphrase approach currently used. Our processing times have a median of seven seconds as compared to eight minutes for the existing system, and our system is much easier to use."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3307","fieldValue":" This paper describes the use of desktop and immersive virtual environments to study judgments that pedestrians make when deciding to cross a street. In particular, we assess the ability of people to discriminate and estimate time-to-contact (TTC) for approaching vehicles under a variety of conditions. Four experiments observing TTC judgments under various conditions are described. We examine the effect of type of vehicle, viewpoint, presentation mode, and TTC value on TTC judgments. We find no significant effect of type of vehicle or of viewpoint, extending prior work to cover all views typically encountered by pedestrians. Discrimination of short values for TTC judgments is generally consistent with the literature, but performance degrades significantly for long TTC values. Finally, we find no significant difference between judgments made in a desktop environment versus a head-mounted display, indicating that tracking the approaching vehicle with one's head does not aid discrimination. In general, people appear to use strategies similar to those that pedestrians use to make real-world, street-crossing decisions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3307","fieldValue":"ACM"}
