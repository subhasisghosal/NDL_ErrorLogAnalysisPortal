{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24746","fieldValue":" This paper presents HCSM, a framework for behavior and scenario control based on communicating hierarchical, concurrent state machines. We specify the structure and an operational execution model of HCSM's state machines. Without providing formal semantics, we provide enough detail to implement the state machines and an execution engine to run them. HCSM explicitly marries the reactive (or logical) portion of system behavior with the control activities that produce the behavior. HCSM state machines contain activity functions that produce outputs each time a machine is executed. An activity function's output value is computed as a function of accessible external data and the outputs of lower-level state machines. We show how this enables HCSM to model behaviors that involve attending to multiple concurrent concerns and arbitrating between conflicting demands for limited resources. The execution algorithm is free of order dependencies that cause robustness and stability problems in behavior modeling. In addition, we examine the problems of populating virtual environments with autonomous agents exhibiting interesting behavior and of authoring scenarios involving such agents. We argue that HCSM is well suited for modeling the reactive behavior of autonomous agents and for directing such agents to produce desired situations. We demonstrate use of HCSM for modeling vehicle behavior and orchestrating scenarios in the Iowa Driving Simulator, an immersive real-time virtual driving environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24746","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24746","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24747","fieldValue":" This article is concerned with the efficient simulation of communication systems on parallel processors. In most of the article, we assume that the communication system under study can be modeled as a system of finite exponential queues with a general topology (in particular, the system need not be acyclic) and with either loss or communication blocking. We also assume that to estimate the performance measures of interest, it is necessary to generate long sample paths of the system. This is the case in both steady-state simulations and in long transient simulations. The approach involves applying each processor to simulate the entire system for a part of the time horizon of interest. We present theory guaranteeing the validity of the proposed approach, and numerical results proving the viability of the approach. The proof of the validity of the approach uses the fact that the queueing systems considered are continuous time Markov chains. An essential part of the argument is a proof that sample paths starting from different initial states eventually will couple (i.e., become identical), and a simple method for recognizing the time when a sample path has become independent of the original starting state (i.e., when all sample paths have coupled, regardless of the initial state). Finally, we discuss how our approach can be used for parallel trace-driven simulations of certain nonMarkovian systems, and state the implications of this research for the initialization bias problem in steady-state simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24748","fieldValue":"Chang, Cheng-Shang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24748","fieldValue":" This article describes an efficient technique for estimating, via simulation, the probability of buffer overflows in a queueing model that arises in the analysis of ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) communication switches. There are multiple streams of (autocorrelated) traffic feeding the switch that has a buffer of finite capacity. Each stream is designated as being of either high or low priority. When the queue length reaches a certain threshold, only high priority packets are admitted to the switch's buffer. The problem is to estimate the loss rate of high priority packets. An asymptotically optimal importance sampling approach is developed for this rare event simulation problem. In this approach, the importance sampling is done in two distinct phases. In the first phase, an importance sampling change of measure is used to bring the queue length up to the threshold at which low priority packets get rejected. In the second phase a different importance sampling change of measure is used to move the queue length from the threshold to the buffer capacity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24748","fieldValue":"ACM"}
