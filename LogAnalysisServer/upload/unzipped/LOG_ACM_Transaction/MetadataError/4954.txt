However, virtual reality systems introduce latency in the visual system that may alter driving behavior, which, in turn, results in questionable validity. Previous studies have mainly focused on visual latency as a separate phenomenon. In this work, latency is studied from a task-dependent viewpoint to investigate how participantsâ\u20AC™ driving behavior changed with increased latency. In this study, the investigation was performed through experiments in which regular drivers were subjected to different levels of visual latency while performing a simple slalom driving task. The driversâ\u20AC™ performances were recorded and evaluated in both lateral and longitudinal directions along with self-assessment questionnaires regarding task performance and difficulty. All participants managed to complete the driving tasks successfully, even under high latency conditions, but were clearly affected by the increased visual latency. The results suggest that drivers compensate for longer latencies by steering more and increasing the safety margins but without reducing their speed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3539","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3539","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3540","fieldValue":"Pinheiro, Antoacutenio M G"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3540","fieldValue":" The influence of chromatic impairments on the perceived image quality is studied in this article. Under the D65 standard illuminant, a set of hyperspectral images were represented into the CIELAB color space, and the corresponding chromatic coordinates were subdivided into clusters with the k-means algorithm. Each color cluster was shifted by a predefined chromatic impairment $$Î\u201DE^&ast;_ab$ with random direction in a&ast;b&ast; chromatic coordinates only. Applying impairments of 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 in a&ast;b&ast;$ coordinates to five hyperspectral images a set of modified images was generated. Those images were shown to subjects that were asked to rank their quality based on their naturalness. The Mean Opinion Score of the subjective evaluations was computed to quantify the sensitivity to the chromatic variations. This article is also complemented with an objective evaluation of the quality using several state-of-the-art metrics and using the CIEDE2000 color difference among others. Analyzing the correlations between subjective and objective quality evaluation helps us to conclude that the proposed quality estimators based on the CIEDE2000 provide the best representation. Moreover, it was concluded that the established quality metrics only become reliable by averaging their results on each color component."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3540","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3540","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3541","fieldValue":" We test the possibility of tapping the subconscious mind for face recognition using consumer-grade BCIs. To this end, we performed an experiment whereby subjects were presented with photographs of famous persons with the expectation that about 20&percnt; of them would be (consciously) recognized; and since the photos are of famous persons, we expected that subjects would have seen before some of the 80&percnt; they didnâ\u20AC™t (consciously) recognize. Further, we expected that their subconscious would have recognized some of those in the 80&percnt; pool that they had seen before. An exit questionnaire and a set of criteria allowed us to label recognitions as conscious, false, no recognitions, or subconscious recognitions. We analyzed a number of event related potentials training and testing a support vector machine. We found that our method is capable of differentiating between no recognitions and subconscious recognitions with promising accuracy levels, suggesting that tapping the subconscious mind for face recognition is feasible."}
