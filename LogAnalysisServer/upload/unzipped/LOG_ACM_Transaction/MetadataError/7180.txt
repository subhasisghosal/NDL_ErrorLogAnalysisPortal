We identify a critical time scale Th such that: 1) aggregate traffic fluctuation slower than Th can be tracked by the admission controller and compensated for by flow admissions and departures; and 2) fluctuations faster than Th have to be absorbed by reserving spare bandwidth on the link. The critical time scale is shown to scale as Th\/âˆšn, where Th is the average flow duration and n is the size of the link in terms of number of flows it can carry. An MBAC design is presented which filters aggregate measurements into low- and high-frequency components separated at the cutoff frequency 1\/Th, using the low-frequency component to track slow time-scale traffic fluctuations and the high-frequency component to estimate the spare bandwidth needed. Our analysis shows that the scheme achieves high utilization and is robust to traffic heterogeneity, multiple time-scale fluctuations and measurement errors. The scheme uses only measurements of aggregate bandwidth and does not need to keep track of per-flow information."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9180","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9180","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9180","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9181","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study several properties of binary-feedback congestion control in rate-based applications. We first derive necessary conditions for generic binary-feedback congestion control to converge to fairness monotonically (which guarantees asymptotic stability of the fairness point) and show that AIMD is the only TCP-friendly binomial control with monotonic convergence to fairness. We then study steady-state behavior of binomial controls with n competing flows on a single bottleneck. Our main result here shows that combined probing for new bandwidth by all flows results in significant overshoot of the available bandwidth and rapid (often super-linear as a function of n) increase in packet loss. We also show that AIMD has the best scalability and lowest packet-loss increase among all TCP-friendly binomial schemes. We conclude the paper by deriving the conditions necessary to achieve constant packet loss regardless of the number of competing flows n and examine one new scheme with such constant packet loss called ideally scalable congestion control in both simulation and streaming experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9181","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9181","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9181","fieldValue":"ACM"}
