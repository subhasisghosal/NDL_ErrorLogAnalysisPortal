{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24684","fieldValue":" A theory of distributed simulation applicable to both discrete-event and continuous simulation is presented. It derives many existing simulation algorithms from the theory and describes an implementation of a new algorithm derived from the theory. A high-level discrete-event simulation language has been implemented, using the new algorithm, on parallel computers; performance results of the implementation are also presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24684","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24684","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24685","fieldValue":" We provide upper and lower bounds and an approximation for speedup of an optimistic self-initiated distributed simulation using a very simple model. We assume an arbitrary number of processors and a uniform connection topology. By showing that the lower bound increases essentially linearly with P, the number of processors, we find that the optimistic approach scales well as P increases. The model tracks the progress of Global Virtual Time (GVT) and eliminates the need to know the virtual time positions of all processors, thus making the analysis quite straightforward."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24685","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24685","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24686","fieldValue":"Luh, Cheng-Jye"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24686","fieldValue":"Kim, Tag-Gon"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24686","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24686","fieldValue":"ACM"}
