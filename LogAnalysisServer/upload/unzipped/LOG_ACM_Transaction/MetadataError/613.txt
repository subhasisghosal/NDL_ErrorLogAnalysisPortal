We describe a technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences, by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use quasiconvex programming to determine the weight function yielding the smallest upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst-case time bounds."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12935","fieldValue":"Wang, Li-C"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12935","fieldValue":"Cheng, Kwang-Ting Tim"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12935","fieldValue":"Lin, Chih-Chang Andy"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12935","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a symbolic simulation method where Boolean functions can be efficiently manipulated through a 2-domain partitioned OBDD data structure. The functional partition is applied by automatically exploring the key decision points implicitly built inside a circuit. The partition can help to significantly reduce the OBDD sizes, solving problems that could not be solved with monolithic OBDD data structure. We demonstrate the performance of the approach through the symbolic simulation of several benchmark circuits with complex control logics and datapath. The symbolic simulation based on 2-domain partitioned OBDD can be also applied in equivalence checking. It can generate the signature of functions to identify the critical partition points in the optimized gate-level netlist."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12935","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12935","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12936","fieldValue":" This article describes a technique that simplifies the design of pipelined circuits automates the specification and verification of structural-hazard and datapath correctness properties for pipelined circuits.

Our case studies include scalar and superscalar implementations of a 32-bit OpenRISC integer microprocessor."}
