The model unifies the conceptualizations of two independent projects, Genesis and Avoca, that are successful examples of software component\/building-block technologies and domain modeling. Building-block technologies exploit large-scale reuse, rely on open architecture software, and elevate the granularity of programming to the subsystem level. Domain modeling formalizes the similarities and differences among systems of a domain. We believe our model is a blueprint for achieving software component technologies in many domains."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22553","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22553","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22554","fieldValue":"Kahana, Chaim-arie"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22554","fieldValue":" The problem of extending the language of statecharts to include overlapping states is considered. The need for such an extension is motivated and the subtlety of the problem is illustrated by exhibiting the shortcomings of naive approaches. The syntax and formal semantics of our extension are then presented, showing in the process that the definitions for conventional statecharts constitute a special case. Our definitions are rather complex, a fact that we feel points to the inherent difficulty of such an extension. We thus prefer to leave open the question of whether or not it should be adopted in practice."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22554","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22554","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/3145","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"November 2011\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3181\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, November 2011\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"August 2011\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3180\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, August 2011\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"January 2011\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3179\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, January 2011\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"October 2010\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3178\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, October 2010\"}]"}
