We formulate this optimization problem as a Quadratic Assignment Problem and use this to formally verify that the code found by the heuristic algorithm is the global optimum. We also argue that it is strongly misleading to compare the genetic code only with codes sampled from the fixed block model, because the real code space is orders of magnitude larger. We thus enlarge the space from which random codes can be sampled from approximately 2.433 \\times 10^{18} codes to approximately 5.908 \\times 10^{45} codes. We do this by leaving the fixed block model, and using the wobble rules to formulate the characteristics acceptable for a genetic code. By relaxing more constraints, three larger spaces are also constructed. Using a modified error function, the genetic code is found to be more error robust compared to a background of randomly generated codes with increasing space size. We point out that these results do not necessarily imply that the code was optimized during evolution for error minimization, but that other mechanisms could be the reason for this error robustness."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4655","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4655","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4655","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_MULTIPLE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4656","fieldValue":"Wong, William W  L"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4656","fieldValue":"Wong, William W  L"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4656","fieldValue":" Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) correlate biological activities of chemical compounds with their physicochemical descriptors. By modeling the observed relationship seen between molecular descriptors and their corresponding biological activities, we may predict the behavior of other molecules with similar descriptors. In QSAR studies, it has been shown that the quality of the prediction model strongly depends on the selected features within molecular descriptors. Thus, methods capable of automatic selection of relevant features are very desirable. In this paper, we present a new feature selection algorithm for a QSAR study based on kernel alignment which has been used as a measure of similarity between two kernel functions. In our algorithm, we deploy kernel alignment as an evaluation tool, using recursive feature elimination to compute a molecular descriptor containing the most important features needed for a classification application. Empirical results show that the algorithm works well for the computation of descriptors for various applications involving different QSAR data sets. The prediction accuracies are substantially increased and are comparable to those from earlier studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4656","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4656","fieldValue":"ACM"}
