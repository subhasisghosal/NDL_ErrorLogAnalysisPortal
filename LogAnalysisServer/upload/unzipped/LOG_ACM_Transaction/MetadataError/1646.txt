The coordinates are motivated by Green's third integral identity and respect both the vertices position and faces orientation of the cage. We show that Green Coordinates lead to space deformations with a shape-preserving property. In particular, in 2D they induce conformal mappings, and extend naturally to quasi-conformal mappings in 3D. In both cases we derive closed-form expressions for the coordinates, yielding a simple and fast algorithm for cage-based space deformation. We compare the performance of Green Coordinates with those of Mean Value Coordinates and Harmonic Coordinates and show that the advantage of the shape-preserving property is not achieved at the expense of speed or simplicity. We also show that the new coordinates extend the mapping in a natural analytic manner to the exterior of the cage, allowing the employment of partial cages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15951","fieldValue":" This paper addresses the long-standing problem of the unavoidable gaps that arise when expressing the intersection of two NURBS surfaces using conventional trimmed-NURBS representation. The solution converts each trimmed NURBS into an untrimmed T-Spline, and then merges the untrimmed T-Splines into a single, watertight model. The solution enables watertight fillets of NURBS models, as well as arbitrary feature curves that do not have to follow iso-parameter curves. The resulting T-Spline representation can be exported without error as a collection of NURBS surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15951","fieldValue":"NURBS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15952","fieldValue":" Animating a crowd of characters is an important problem in computer graphics. The latest techniques enable highly realistic group motions to be produced in feature animation films and video games. However, interactive methods have not emerged yet for editing the existing group motion of multiple characters. We present an approach to editing group motion as a whole while maintaining its neighborhood formation and individual moving trajectories in the original animation as much as possible. The user can deform a group motion by pinning or dragging individuals. Multiple group motions can be stitched or merged to form a longer or larger group motion while avoiding collisions. These editing operations rely on a novel graph structure, in which vertices represent positions of individuals at specific frames and edges encode neighborhood formations and moving trajectories. We employ a shape-manipulation technique to minimize the distortion of relative arrangements among adjacent vertices while editing the graph structure. The usefulness and flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through examples in which the user creates and edits complex crowd animations interactively using a collection of group motion clips."}
