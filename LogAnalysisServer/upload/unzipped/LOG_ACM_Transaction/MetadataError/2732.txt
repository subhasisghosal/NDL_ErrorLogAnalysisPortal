{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19091","fieldValue":" MultRoot is a collection of Matlab modules for accurate computation of polynomial roots, especially roots with non-trivial multiplicities. As a blackbox-type software, MultRoot requires the polynomial coefficients as the only input, and outputs the computed roots, multiplicities, backward error, estimated forward error, and the structure-preserving condition number. The most significant features of MultRoot are the multiplicity identification capability and high accuracy on multiple roots without using multiprecision arithmetic, even if the polynomial coefficients are inexact. A comprehensive test suite of polynomials that are collected from the literature is included for numerical experiments and performance comparison."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19091","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19091","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19092","fieldValue":"Quintana-Ort, Enrique S."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19092","fieldValue":"Geijn, Robert A van de"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19092","fieldValue":" In this article we present a systematic approach to the derivation of families of high-performance algorithms for a large set of frequently encountered dense linear algebra operations. As part of the derivation a constructive proof of the correctness of the algorithm is generated. The article is structured so that it can be used as a tutorial for novices. However, the method has been shown to yield new high-performance algorithms for well-studied linear algebra operations and should also be of interest to those who wish to produce best-in-class high-performance codes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19092","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19092","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19093","fieldValue":"Quintana-Ort, Enrique S."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19093","fieldValue":"Geijn, Robert A van de"}
