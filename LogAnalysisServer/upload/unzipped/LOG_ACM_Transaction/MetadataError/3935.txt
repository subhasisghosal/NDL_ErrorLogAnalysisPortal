More precisely, it addresses semi-formal diagram notations that have precisely-defined syntax, but informally defined (dynamic) semantics. These notations are often flexible to fit the different needs and expectations of users. Flexibility comes from the incompleteness or informality of the original definition and results in different interpretations.The approach defines interpreters by means of a mapping onto a semantic domain. Two sets of rules define the correspondences between the elements of the diagram notation and those of the semantic domain, and between events and states of the semantic domain and visual annotations on the elements of the diagram notation.Flexibility also leads to notation families, that is, sets of notations that share core concepts, but present slightly different interpretations. Existing approaches usually interpret these notations in isolation; the approach presented in this article allows the interpretation of a family as a whole. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through a prototype generator that allows users to implement special-purpose interpreters by defining relatively small sets of rules."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22713","fieldValue":" This article describes an empirical study in industry of requirements engineering process maturity assessment and improvement. Our aims were to evaluate a requirements engineering process maturity model and to assess if improvements in requirements engineering process maturity lead to business improvements. We first briefly describe the process maturity model that we used and modifications to this model to accommodate process improvement. We present initial maturity assessment results for nine companies, describe how process improvements were selected and present data on how RE process maturity changed after these improvements were introduced. We discuss how business benefits were assessed and the difficulties of relating process maturity improvements to these business benefits. All companies reported business benefits and satisfaction with their participation in the study. Our conclusions are that the RE process maturity model is useful in supporting maturity assessment and in identifying process improvements and there is some evidence to suggest that process improvement leads to business benefits. However, whether these business benefits were a consequence of the changes to the RE process or whether these benefits resulted from side-effects of the study such as greater self-awareness of business processes remains an open question."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22713","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22713","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22714","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22714","fieldValue":"ACM"}
