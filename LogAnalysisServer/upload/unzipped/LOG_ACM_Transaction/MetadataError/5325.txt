{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4437","fieldValue":" Some genetic diseases in human beings are dominated by short sequences repeated consecutively called tandem repeats. Once a region containing tandem repeats is found, it is of great interest to study the history of creating the repeats. The computational problem of reconstructing the duplication history of tandem repeats has been studied extensively in the literature. Almost all previous studies focused on the simplest case where the size of each duplication block is 1. Only recently we sì³®ded in giving the first polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a guaranteed ratio for a more general case where the size of each duplication block is at most 2; the algorithm achieves a ratio of 6 and runs in O(n^{11}) time. In this paper, we present two new polynomial-time approximation algorithms for this more general case. One of them achieves a ratio of 5 and runs in O(n^9) time, while the other achieves a ratio of 2.5+\\epsilon for any constant \\epsilon > 0 but runs slower."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4437","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1033","fieldValue":" Regions of control dependence identify the instructions in a program that execute under the same control conditions. They have a variety of applications in parallelizing and optimizing compilers. Two vertices in a control-flow graph (which may represent instructions or basic blocks in a program) are in the same region if they have the same set of control dependence predecessors. The common algorithm for computing regions examines each control dependence at least once. As there may be O(V x E) control dependences in the worst case, where V and E are the number of vertices and edges in the control-flow graph, this algorithm has a worst-case running time of O(V x D). We present algorithms for finding regions in reducible control-flow graphs in near-linear time, without using control dependence. These algorithms are based on alternative definitions of regions, which are easier to reason with than the definitions based on control dependence."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1033","fieldValue":"What's in a region?: or computing control dependence regions in near-linear time for reducible control flow"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1341","fieldValue":" As climate change has become a global concern and server energy demand continues to soar, many IT companies have started to explore server clusters running on various renewable energy sources. Existing green data center designs often yield suboptimal performance as they only look at a certain specific type of energy source. This article explores data centers powered by hybrid renewable energy systems. We propose GreenWorks, a framework for HPC data centers running on a renewable energy mix. Specifically, GreenWorks features a cross-layer power management scheme tailored to the timing behaviors and capacity constraints of different energy sources. Using realistic workload traces and renewable energy data, we show that GreenWorks could provide a near-optimal workload performance (within 3&percnt; difference) on average. It can also reduce the worst-case performance degradation by 43&percnt; compared to the state-of-the-art design. Moreover, the performance improvements are based on carbon-neutral operations and are not at the cost of significant efficiency degradation and reduced battery lifecycle. Our technique becomes more efficient when servers become more energy proportional and can effectively handle the ever-increasing depth of renewable power penetration in green data centers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1341","fieldValue":"ACM"}
