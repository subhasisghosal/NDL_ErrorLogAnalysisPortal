Traffic between pairs of nodes is carried through lightpaths which are high-bandwidth end-to-end circuits, occupying a wavelength on each link of the path between two nodes. We are interested in dimensioning the WDM links so that the first lightpath request rejection will occur, with high probability, after a specified period of time T. Here we introduce the concept of capacity exhaustion probability--the probability that at least one lightpath request will be rejected in the time period (0,T) due to lack of bandwidth\/capacity on some link. We propose a network dimensioning method based on a traffic growth model which eventually results in a nonlinear optimization problem with cost minimization as the objective and route capacity exhaustion probabilities as the constraints. Computation of exact capacity exhaustion probabilities requires large computing resources and is thus feasible only for small networks. We consider a reduced load approximation for estimating capacity exhaustion probabilities of a wavelength routed network with arbitrary topology and traffic patterns. We show that the estimates are quite accurate and converge to the correct values under a limiting regime in the desired range of low-capacity exhaustion probabilities."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9211","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9211","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9211","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9212","fieldValue":" We start with the premise, and provide evidence that it is valid, that a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP) is a good model for Internet traffic at the packet\/byte level. We present an algorithm to estimate the parameters and size of a discrete MMPP (D-MMPP) from a data trace. This algorithm requires only two passes through the data. In tandem-network queueing models, the input to a downstream queue is the output from an upstream queue, so the arrival rate is limited by the rate of the upstream queue. We show how to modify the MMPP describing the arrivals to the upstream queue to approximate this effect. To extend this idea to networks that are not tandem, we show how to approximate the superposition of MMPPs without encountering the state-space explosion that occurs in exact computations.Numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy of these methods are given. We also present a method to convert our estimated D-MMPP to a continuous-time MMPP, which is used as the arrival process in a matrix-analytic queueing model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9212","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9212","fieldValue":"ACM"}
