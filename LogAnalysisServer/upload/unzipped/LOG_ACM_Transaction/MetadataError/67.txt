More specifically, the review covers the literature on programming misconceptions, the cognitive theory of mental models, constructivist theory of knowledge and learning, phenomenographic research on experiencing programming, and the theory of threshold concepts. These bodies of work are examined in relation to the concept of a â\u20ACœnotional machineâ\u20AC?â\u20AC\u201Dan abstract computer for executing programs of a particular kind. As a whole, the literature points to notional machines as a major challenge in introductory programming education. It is argued that instructors should acknowledge the notional machine as an explicit learning objective and address it in teaching. Teaching within some programming paradigms, such as object-oriented programming, may benefit from using multiple notional machines at different levels of abstraction. Pointers to some promising pedagogical techniques are provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11162","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11162","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11163","fieldValue":" Active learning in the college classroom has long been promoted as more effective than traditional lecture. Increased adoption of these instructional practices is recommended in several prominent national reports as well as a new National Science Foundation program. The goal of this special issue is to share evidence-based instructional practices that have been applied to computer science education. With collaborative learning, students interact with each other to achieve a common learning goal. Peer Instruction is an active pedagogy pioneered in Physics education in which most lecture time is replaced with students answering carefully designed multiple-choice questions. Chemistry faculty developed and refined an inquiry-based pedagogy called Process-Oriented Guided-Inquiry Learning (POGIL). The fields of Architecture and Fine Arts promote student collaboration in studio-based learning."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11163","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11163","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2019","fieldValue":" This article introduces a practical low-overhead adaptive technique of correcting sampling bias in profiling dynamic call graphs. Timer-based sampling keeps the overhead low but sampling bias lowers the accuracy when either observable call events or sampling actions are not equally spaced in time. To mitigate sampling bias, our adaptive correction technique weights each sample by monitoring time-varying spacing of call events and sampling actions. We implemented and evaluated our adaptive correction technique in Jikes RVM, a high-performance virtual machine. In our empirical evaluation, our technique significantly improved the sampling accuracy without measurable overhead and resulted in effective feedback directed inlining."}
