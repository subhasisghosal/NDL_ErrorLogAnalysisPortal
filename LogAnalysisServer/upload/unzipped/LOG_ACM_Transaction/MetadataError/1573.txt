First, we extend 2D texture optimization techniques to synthesize 3D texture solids. Next, the non-parametric texture optimization approach is integrated with histogram matching, which forces the global statistics of the synthesized solid to match those of the exemplar. This improves the convergence of the synthesis process and enables using smaller neighborhoods. In addition to producing compelling texture mapped surfaces, our method also effectively models the material in the interior of solid objects. We also demonstrate that our method is well-suited for synthesizing textures with a large number of channels per texel."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15758","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15758","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15759","fieldValue":"Lalonde, Jean-Franois"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15759","fieldValue":" We present a system for inserting new objects into existing photographs by querying a vast image-based object library, pre-computed using a publicly available Internet object database. The central goal is to shield the user from all of the arduous tasks typically involved in image compositing. The user is only asked to do two simple things: 1) pick a 3D location in the scene to place a new object; 2) select an object to insert using a hierarchical menu. We pose the problem of object insertion as a data-driven, 3D-based, context-sensitive object retrieval task. Instead of trying to manipulate the object to change its orientation, color distribution, etc. to fit the new image, we simply retrieve an object of a specified class that has all the required properties (camera pose, lighting, resolution, etc) from our large object library. We present new automatic algorithms for improving object segmentation and blending, estimating true 3D object size and orientation, and estimating scene lighting conditions. We also present an intuitive user interface that makes object insertion fast and simple even for the artistically challenged."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15759","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15759","fieldValue":"ACM"}
