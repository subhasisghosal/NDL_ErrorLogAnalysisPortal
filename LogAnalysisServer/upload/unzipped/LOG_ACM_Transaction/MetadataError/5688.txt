[1], which provided motifs as a way to uncover the basic building blocks of most networks. Motifs have been mainly applied in Bioinformatics, regarding gene regulation networks. Motif detection is based on induced subgraph counting. This paper proposes an algorithm to count subgraphs of size k + 2 based on the set of induced subgraphs of size k. The general technique was applied to detect 3, 4 and 5-sized motifs in directed graphs. Such algorithms have time complexity O(a(G)m), $O(m^2) and O(nm2$), respectively, where a(G) is the arboricity of G(V,E). The computational experiments in public data sets show that the proposed technique was one order of magnitude faster than Kavosh and FANMOD. When compared to NetMODE, acc-Motif had a slightly improved performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5093","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5094","fieldValue":"Elloumi-Oueslati, Afef"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5094","fieldValue":" Investigating the roles and functions of DNA within genomes is becoming a primary focus of genomic research. Thus, the research works are moving towards cooperation between different scientific disciplines which aims at facilitating the interpretation of genetic information. In order to characterize the DNA of living organisms, signal processing tools appear to be very suitable for such study. However, a DNA sequence must be converted into a numerical sequence before processing; which defines the concept of DNA coding. In line with this, we propose a new one dimensional model based on the chaos game representation theory called Frequency Chaos Game Signal: FCGS. Then, we perform a Smoothed Fourier Transform to enhance hidden periodicities in the C.elegans DNA sequences. Through this study, we demonstrate the performance of our coding approach in highlighting characteristic periodicities. Indeed, several periodicities are shown to be involved in the 1D spectra and the 2D spectrograms of FCGSs. To investigate further about the contribution of our method in the enhancement of characteristic spectral attributes, a comparison with a range of binary indicators is established."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5094","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5094","fieldValue":"Building specific signals from frequency chaos game and revealing periodicities using a smoothed Fourier analysis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5094","fieldValue":"ACM"}
