We assume n legitimate nodes move according to the fast i.i.d. mobility pattern and each desires to communicate with one randomly selected destination node. There are also $n^v static eavesdroppers located uniformly in the network and we assume the number of eavesdroppers is much larger than that of legitimate nodes, i.e., v > 1. We propose a novel simple secure communication model, i.e., the secure protocol model, and prove its equivalence to the widely accepted secure physical model under a few technical assumptions. Based on the proposed model, a framework of analyzing the secrecy capacity and delay in MANETs is established. Given a delay constraint D, we find that the optimal secrecy throughput capacity is [EQUATION](W((D\/n))(2\/3), where W is the data rate of each link. We observe that: 1) the capacity-delay tradeoff is independent of the number of eavesdroppers, which indicates that adding more eavesdroppers will not degenerate the performance of the legitimate network as long as v > 1; 2) the capacity-delay tradeoff of our paper outperforms the previous result $Î˜((1\/nÏˆ_e)) in [11], where Ïˆe = nv--1$ = Ï\u2030(1) is the density of the eavesdroppers. Throughout this paper, for functions f(n) and G(n), we denote f(n) = o(g(n)) if limnâ\u2020\u2019âˆž$ (f(n)\/g(n)) = 0; f(n) = Ï\u2030(g(n)) if g(n) = o(f(n)); f(n) = O(g(n)) if there is a positive constant c such that f(n) â\u2030¤ cg(n) for sufficiently large n; f(n) = Î©(g(n))if g(n) = O(f(n)); f(n) = Î˜(g(n) if both f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Omega;(g(n)) hold. Besides, the order notation [EQUATION] omits the polylogarithmic factors for better readability."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10975","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10975","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10975","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10975","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10976","fieldValue":" We study distributed queueing games in interference-limited wireless networks. We formulate the throughput maximization problem via distributed selection of users' transmission thresholds as a Nash Equilibrium Problem (NEP). We first focus on the solution analysis of the NEP and derive sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a Nash Equilibrium (NE). Then, we develop a general best-response-based algorithmic framework wherein the users can explicitly choose the degree of desired cooperation and signaling, converging to different types of solutions, namely: 1) a NE of the NEP when there is no cooperation among users and 2) a stationary point of the Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem associated with the NEP, when some cooperation among the users in the form of (pricing) message passing is allowed. Finally, as a benchmark, we design a globally optimal but centralized solution method for the nonconvex NUM problem. Our experiments show that in many scenarios the sum-throughput at the NE of the NEP is very close to the global optimum of the NUM problem, which validates our noncooperative and distributed approach. When the gap of the NE from the global optimality is non negligible (e.g., in the presence of \"high\" coupling among users), exploiting cooperation among the users in the form of pricing enhances the system performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10976","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
