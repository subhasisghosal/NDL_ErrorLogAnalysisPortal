Thus, the ability to filter spoofed IP packets near victim servers is essential to their own protection and prevention of becoming involuntary DoS reflectors. Although an attacker can forge any field in the IP header, he cannot falsify the number of hops an IP packet takes to reach its destination. More importantly, since the hop-count values are diverse, an attacker cannot randomly spoof IP addresses while maintaining consistent hop-counts. On the other hand, an Internet server can easily infer the hop-count information from the Time-to-Live (TTL) field of the IP header. Using a mapping between IP addresses and their hop-counts, the server can distinguish spoofed IP packets from legitimate ones. Based on this observation, we present a novel filtering technique, called Hop-Count Filtering (HCF)--which builds an accurate IP-to-hop-count (IP2HC) mapping table--to detect and discard spoofed IP packets. HCF is easy to deploy, as it does not require any support from the underlying network. Through analysis using network measurement data, we show that HCF can identify close to 90% of spoofed IP packets, and then discard them with little collateral damage. We implement and evaluate HCF in the Linux kernel, demonstrating its effectiveness with experimental measurements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9575","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9575","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9575","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1864","fieldValue":" Many new memory technologies are available for building future energy-efficient memory hierarchies. It is necessary to have a framework that can quickly find the optimal memory technology at each hierarchy level. In this work, we first build a circuit-architecture joint design space exploration framework by combining RC circuit analysis and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based performance modeling. Then, we use this framework to evaluate some emerging nonvolatile memory hierarchies. We demonstrate that a Resistive RAM (ReRAM)-based cache hierarchy on an 8-core Chip-Multiprocessor (CMP) system can achieve a 24&percnt; Energy Delay Product (EDP) improvement and a 36&percnt; Energy Delay Area Product (EDAP) improvement compared to a conventional hierarchy with SRAM on-chip caches and DRAM main memory."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1864","fieldValue":"DRAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1864","fieldValue":"PCRAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1864","fieldValue":"SRAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1864","fieldValue":"STTRAM"}
