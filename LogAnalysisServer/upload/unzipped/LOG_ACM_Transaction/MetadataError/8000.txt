{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10818","fieldValue":" The unprecedented growth of mobile data traffic challenges the performance and economic viability of today's cellular networks and calls for novel network architectures and communication solutions. Mobile data offloading through third-party Wi-Fi or femtocell access points (APs) can significantly alleviate the cellular congestion and enhance user quality of service (QoS), without requiring costly and time-consuming infrastructure investments. This solution has substantial benefits both for the mobile network operators (MNOs) and the mobile users, but comes with unique technical and economic challenges that must be jointly addressed. In this paper, we consider a market where MNOs lease APs that are already deployed by residential users for the offloading purpose. We assume that each MNO can employ multiple APs, and each AP can concurrently serve traffic from multiple MNOs. We design an iterative double-auction mechanism that ensures the efficient operation of the market by maximizing the differences between the MNOs' offloading benefits and APs' offloading costs. The proposed scheme takes into account the particular characteristics of the wireless network, such as the coupling of MNOs' offloading decisions and APs' capacity constraints. Additionally, it does not require full information about the MNOs and APs and creates non-negative revenue for the market broker."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10818","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10818","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10819","fieldValue":" The ability to provide guaranteed network bandwidth for tenants is essential to the prosperity of cloud computing platforms, as it is a critical step for offering predictable performance to applications. Despite its importance, it is still an open problem for efficient network bandwidth sharing in a multitenant environment, especially when applications have diverse bandwidth requirements. More precisely, it is not only that different tenants have distinct demands, but also that one tenant may want to assign bandwidth differently across her virtual machines (VMs), i.e., the heterogeneous bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we tackle the problem of VM allocation with bandwidth guarantee in multitenant data center networks. We first propose an online VM allocation algorithm that improves on the accuracy of the existing work. Next, we develop a VM allocation algorithm under heterogeneous bandwidth demands. We conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of our method."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10819","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10819","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10819","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10820","fieldValue":" This paper investigates the rating of network paths, i.e., acquiring quantized measures of path properties such as round-trip time and available bandwidth. Compared to fine-grained measurements, coarse-grained ratings are appealing in that they are not only informative but also cheap to obtain. Motivated by this insight, we first address the scalable acquisition of path ratings by statistical inference. By observing similarities to recommender systems, we examine the applicability of solutions to a recommender system and show that our inference problem can be solved by a class of matrix factorization techniques. A technical contribution is an active and progressive inference framework that not only improves the accuracy by selectively measuring more informative paths, but also speeds up the convergence for available bandwidth by incorporating its measurement methodology. Then, we investigate the usability of rating-based network measurement and inference in applications. A case study is performed on whether locality awareness can be achieved for overlay networks of Pastry and BitTorrent using inferred ratings. We show that such coarse-grained knowledge can improve the performance of peer selection and that finer granularities do not always lead to larger improvements."}
