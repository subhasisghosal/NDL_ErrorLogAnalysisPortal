The presence of statistical scaling properties, that is, self-similarity, is critical for determining how to model network dynamics. In this work, we study the role that self-similarity scaling plays in a social network edge creation (that is, links created between users) process, through analysis of two detailed, time-stamped traces, a 199 million edge trace over 2 years in the Renren social network, and 876K interactions in a 4-year trace of Facebook. Using wavelet-based analysis, we find that the edge creation process in both networks is consistent with self-similarity scaling, once we account for periodic user activity that makes edge creation process non-stationary. Using these findings, we build a complete model of social network dynamics that combines temporal and spatial components. Specifically, the temporal behavior of our model reflects self-similar scaling properties, and accounts for certain deterministic non-stationary features. The spatial side accounts for observed long-term graph properties, such as graph distance shrinkage and local declustering. We validate our model against network dynamics in Renren and Facebook datasets, and show that it sì³®ds in producing desired properties in both temporal patterns and graph structural features."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17787","fieldValue":" With the vast number of items, Web pages, and news from which to choose, online services and customers both benefit tremendously from personalized recommender systems. Such systems additionally provide great opportunities for targeted advertisements by displaying ads alongside genuine recommendations. We consider a biased recommendation system in which such ads are displayed without any tags (disguised as genuine recommendations), rendering them indistinguishable to a single user. We ask whether it is possible for a small subset of collaborating users to detect such bias. We propose an algorithm that can detect this type of bias through statistical analysis on the collaborating usersâ\u20AC™ feedback. The algorithm requires only binary information indicating whether a user was satisfied with each of the recommended item or not. This makes the algorithm widely appealing to real-world issues such as identification of search engine bias and pharmaceutical lobbying. We prove that the proposed algorithm detects the bias with high probability for a broad class of recommendation systems when a sufficient number of users provides feedback on a sufficient number of recommendations. We provide extensive simulations with real datasets and practical recommender systems, which confirm the trade-offs in the theoretical guarantees."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.editor","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17788","fieldValue":"Doncker, Elise de"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.editor","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17788","fieldValue":"Heroux, Michael A"}
