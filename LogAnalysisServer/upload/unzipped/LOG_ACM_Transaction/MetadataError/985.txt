The analysis uses only the steady-state average values of the variables. The solution to the model is given by a cubic, which has exactly one valid root for the range of parametric values that is of interest. The model's predictions agree well with simulation results for transactions that require up to twenty locks. The model separates data contention from resource contention, thus facilitating an analysis of their separate effects and their interaction. It shows that systems with a particular form of nonuniform access, or with shared locks, are equivalent to systems with uniform access and only exclusive locks.Blocking due to conflicts is found to impose an upper bound on transaction throughput; this fact leads to a rule of thumb on how much data contention should be permitted in a system. Throughput can exceed this bound if a transaction is restarted whenever it encounters a conflict, provided restart costs and resource contention are low. It can also be exceeded by making transactions predeclare their locks. Raising the multiprogramming level to increase throughput also raises the number of restarts per completion. Transactions should minimize their lock requests, because data contention is proportional to the square of the number of requests. The choice of how much data to lock at a time depends on which part of a general granularity curve the system sees."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14017","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14017","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14018","fieldValue":" Modeling the storage structures of a DBMS is a prerequisite to understanding and optimizing database performance. Previously, such modeling was very difficult because the fundamental role of conceptual-to-internal mappings in DBMS implementations went unrecognized.In this paper we present a model of physical databases, called the transformation model, that makes conceptual-to-internal mappings explicit. By exposing such mappings, we show that it is possible to model the storage architectures (i.e., the storage structures and mappings) of many commercial DBMSs in a precise, systematic, and comprehendible way. Models of the INQUIRE, ADABAS, and SYSTEM 2000 storage architectures are presented as examples of the model's utility.We believe the transformation model helps bridge the gap between physical database theory and practice. It also reveals the possibility of a technology to automate the development of physical database software."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14019","fieldValue":" In spite of the wide variety of concurrency control and recovery mechanisms proposed during the past decade, the behavior and the performance of various concurrency control and recovery mechanisms remain largely not well understood. In addition, although concurrency control and recovery mechanisms are intimately related, the interaction between them has not been adequately explored. In this paper, we take a unified view of the problems associated with concurrency control and recovery for transaction-oriented multiuser centralized database management systems, and we present several integrated mechanisms. We then develop analytical models to study the behavior and compare the performance of these integrated mechanisms, and we present the results of our performance evaluation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14019","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14019","fieldValue":"ACM"}
