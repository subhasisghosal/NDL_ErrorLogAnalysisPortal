Applications mapped to these platforms have varying memory requirements based on their runtime behavior, resulting in under- or overutilization of the local SPMs. We propose SPMPool to share the available on-chip SPMs on many-cores among concurrently executing applications in order to reduce the overall memory access latency. By pooling SPM resources, we can assign underutilized memory resources, due to idle cores or low memory usage, to applications dynamically. SPMPool is the first workload-aware SPM mapping solution for many-cores that dynamically allocates data at runtimeâ\u20AC\u201Dusing profiled dataâ\u20AC\u201Dto address the unpredictable set of concurrently executing applications. Our experiments on workloads with varying interapplication memory intensity show that SPMPool can achieve up to 76&percnt; reduction in memory access latency for configurations ranging from 16 to 256 cores, compared to the traditional approach that limits executing cores to use their local SPMs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7071","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7071","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7072","fieldValue":" Power estimation has become a strongly desired feature in Electronic System Level (ESL) simulations. Most existing power estimation approaches for this abstraction level require component models with observable internals. However, most ESL models of modern processors are delivered as black box components. This work presents a tool-based ESL power estimation methodology for black box models and its extension for multiple clock frequencies. The evaluation uses hardware measurements of the ARM Cortex-A9 subsystem of the OMAP4460 chip for reference. The achieved estimation error is 5% on average for fixed-frequency power models and 7% for multifrequency power models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7072","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7072","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7073","fieldValue":" Virtual platforms have become essential tools for the design of embedded systems. Developers rely on them for design space exploration and software debugging. However, with rising HW\/SW complexity and the need to simulate more and more processors simultaneously, the performance of virtual platforms degrades rapidly. Parallel simulation techniques can help to counter this by leveraging multicore PCs, which are widely available today. This work presents a novel parallel simulation approach that is targeted toward acceleration of virtual platforms from the ESL domain. By trading some timing accuracy, multiprocessor virtual platforms can be accelerated by up to 3.4Ã\u2014 on regular quad-core workstations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7073","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7073","fieldValue":"ACM"}
