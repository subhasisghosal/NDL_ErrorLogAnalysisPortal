The rationale behind computing reduced-rank approximations is that they allow to reduce the spectral complexity of a music signal. The method is motivated by studies with cochlear implant listeners which have shown that solo instrumental music or music remixed at higher signal-to-interference ratios are preferred over complex music ensembles or orchestras. For computing the reduced-rank approximations we investigate methods based on principal component analysis and partial least squares analysis, and compare them to source separation algorithms. The strategies, which are applied to music with a predominant leading voice, are compared in terms of their ability for mitigating effects of simulated reduced frequency selectivity and with respect to source signal distortions. Established instrumental measures and a newly developed measure indicate a considerable reduction of the auditory distortion resulting from cochlear hearing loss. Furthermore, a listening test reveals a significant preference for the reduced-rank approximations in terms of melody clarity and ease of listening."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3981","fieldValue":" Although context-dependent DNN-HMM systems have achieved significant improvements over GMM-HMM systems, significant performance degradation has been observed if the acoustic condition of the test data mismatches that of the training data. Hence, adaptation and adaptive training of DNN are of great research interest. Previous DNN adaptation works mainly focus on adapting parameters of a single DNN by applying linear transformations to feature or hidden-layer output; introducing vector representation of non-speech variability into the input. In these methods, large number of parameters are required to be estimated during adaptation. In this paper, the cluster adaptive training (CAT) framework is employed for DNN adaptive training. Here, multiple weight matrices are constructed to form the basis of a canonical parametric space. During adaptation, for a new acoustic condition, an interpolation vector is estimated to combine the weight basis into a single adapted weight matrix. Since only the interpolation vector need to be estimated during adaptation, the number of updated parameters is much smaller than existing DNN adaptation methods. The CAT-DNN approach was evaluated on an English switchboard task in unsupervised adaptation mode. It achieved significant WER reductions over the unadapted DNN-HMM, relative 7.6% to 10.6%, with only 10 parameters."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3982","fieldValue":" This paper presents a parametric Bayesian approach to the statistical analysis of phoneme confusion matrices measured for groups of individual listeners in one or more test conditions. Two different bias problems in conventional estimation of mutual information are analyzed and explained theoretically. Evaluations with synthetic datasets indicate that the proposed Bayesian method can give satisfactory estimates of mutual information and response probabilities, even for phoneme confusion tests using a very small number of test items for each phoneme category. The proposed method can reveal overall differences in performance between two test conditions with better power than conventional Wilcoxon significance tests or conventional confidence intervals. The method can also identify sets of confusion-matrix cells that are credibly different between two test conditions, with better power than a similar approximate frequentist method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3982","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3982","fieldValue":"ACM"}
