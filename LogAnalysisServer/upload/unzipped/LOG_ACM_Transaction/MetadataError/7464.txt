A tracking agent (TA) keeps track of the mobiles' handoffs between the APs. A paging agent (PA) triggers the TA to page the mobile when a SIP INVITE is received for one of its users. The context transfer feature of our paging protocol allows the paging messages to deliver the station context in order to enable faster session reestab-lishment. The AP then does onlink paging in a wireless link. SIP extensions are needed to trigger the PA to start paging MNs to notify their dormant status using an extended SIP REGISTER method. Tracking protocol is analyzed to compare soft- and hard-state approaches for state inconsistency ratio, message rate, and the overall cost. The simulation model we developed enables us to evaluate the traffic introduced by the tracking protocol and the cache (state) size. Paging protocol is analyzed for CPU processing times and the transmission delays in the SIP session setup with paging. Simulation of the paging with context transfer is used to show the gains in reauthentication."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9740","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9740","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9740","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9741","fieldValue":" Designing infrastructures that give untrusted third parties (such as end-hosts) control over routing is a promising research direction for achieving flexible and efficient communication. However, serious concerns remain over the deployment of such infrastructures, particularly the new security vulnerabilities they introduce. The flexible control plane of these infrastructures can be exploited to launch many types of powerful attacks with little effort. In this paper, we make several contributions towards studying security issues in forwarding infrastructures (FIs). We present a general model for an FI, analyze potential security vulnerabilities, and present techniques to address these vulnerabilities. The main technique that we introduce in this paper is the use of simple lightweight cryptographic constraints on forwarding entries. We show that it is possible to prevent a large class of attacks on end-hosts and bound the flooding attacks that can be launched on the infrastructure nodes to a small constant value. Our mechanisms are general and apply to a variety of earlier proposals such as i3, DataRouter, and Network Pointers."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9741","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9741","fieldValue":"ACM"}
