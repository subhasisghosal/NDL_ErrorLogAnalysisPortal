An analytical comparison shows that the retrieval performance of methods based on distinct term-scoring functions is comparable on the whole query set but differs considerably on single queries, consistent with the fact that the ordered sets of expansion terms suggested for each query by the different functions are largely uncorrelated. Motivated by these findings, we argue that the results of multiple functions can be merged, by analogy with ensembling classifiers, and present a simple combination technique based on the rank values of the suggested terms. The combined retrieval feedback method is effective not only with respect to unexpanded queries but also to any individual method, with notable improvements on the system's precision. Furthermore, the combined method is robust with respect to variation of experimental parameters and it is beneficial even when the same information needs are expressed with shorter queries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23852","fieldValue":" Missing information, imprecision, inconsistency, vagueness, uncertainty, and ignorance abound in information systems. Such imperfection is a fact of life in database systems. Although these problems are widely studied in relational database systems, this is not the case in conceptual query systems. And yet, concept-based query languages have been proposed and some are already commercial products. It is therefore imperative to study these problems in concept-based query languages, with a view to prescribing formal approaches to dealing with the problems. In this article, we have done just that for a concept-based natural language query system that we developed. A methodology for handling and resolving each type of imperfection is developed. The proposed approaches are automated as much as possible, with the user mainly serving an assistive function."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23852","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23852","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23853","fieldValue":" Compression of large collections can lead to improvements in retrieval times by offsetting the CPU decompression costs with the cost of seeking and retrieving data from disk. We propose a semistatic phrase-based approach called xray that builds a model offline using sample training data extracted from a collection, and then compresses the entire collection online in a single pass. The particular benefits of xray are that it can be used in applications where individual records or documents must be decompressed, and that decompression is fast. The xray scheme also allows new data to be added to a collection without modifying the semistatic model. Moreover, xray can be used to compress general-purpose data such as genomic, scientific, image, and geographic collections without prior knowledge of the structure of the data. We show that xray is effective on both text and general-purpose collections. In general, xray is more effective than the popular gzip and compress schemes, while being marginally less effective than bzip2. We also show that xray is efficient: of the popular schemes we tested, it is typically only slower than gzip in decompression. Moreover, the query evaluation costs of retrieval of documents from a large collection with our search engine is improved by more than 30&percnt; when xray is incorporated compared to an uncompressed approach. We use simple techniques for obtaining the training data from the collection to be compressed and show that with just over 4&percnt; of data the entire collection can be effectively compressed. We also propose four schemes for phrase-match selection during the single pass compression of the collection. We conclude that with these novel approaches xray is a fast and effective scheme for compression and decompression of large general-purpose collections."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23853","fieldValue":"ACM"}
