Five cameras are attached to each PC display and directed at the participant. From these video streams, view synthesis methods produce arbitrary-perspective renderings of the participant and transmit them to others at interactive rates, currently about 15 frames per second. Combining these renderings in a shared synthetic environment gives the appearance of having all participants interacting in a common space. In this way, Coliseum enables users to share a virtual world, with acquired-image renderings of their appearance replacing the synthetic representations provided by more conventional avatar-populated virtual worlds. The system supports virtual mobility---participants may move around the shared space---and reciprocal gaze, and has been demonstrated in collaborative sessions of up to ten Coliseum workstations, and sessions spanning two continents.Coliseum is a complex software system which pushes commodity computing resources to the limit. We set out to measure the different aspects of resource, network, CPU, memory, and disk usage to uncover the bottlenecks and guide enhancement and control of system performance. Latency is a key component of Quality of Experience for video conferencing. We present how each aspect of the system---cameras, image processing, networking, and display---contributes to total latency. Performance measurement is as complex as the system to which it is applied. We describe several techniques to estimate performance through direct light-weight instrumentation as well as use of realistic end-to-end measures that mimic actual user experience. We describe the various techniques and how they can be used to improve system performance for Coliseum and other network applications. This article summarizes the Coliseum technology and reports on issues related to its performance---its measurement, enhancement, and control."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25243","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25244","fieldValue":" We discuss the design goals for an integrated media creation environment (IMCE) aimed at enabling the average user to create media artifacts with professional qualities. The resulting requirements are implemented and we demonstrate the efficacy of the resulting system with the generation of two simple home movies. The significance for the average user seeking to create home movies lies in the flexible and automatic application of film principles to the task, removal of tedious low-level editing by means of well-formed media transformations in terms of high-level film constructs (e.g., tempo), and content repurposing powered by those same transformations added to the rich semantic information maintained at each phase of the process."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25245","fieldValue":" To meet end users' quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, online quality management for multimedia applications must include appropriate allocation of the underlying computing platform's resources. Previous work has developed novel operating system (OS) functionality for dynamic QoS management, including multimedia or real-time CPU schedulers and OS extensions for online performance monitoring and for adaptations, as well as QoS-aware applications that adapt their behavior to gain additional benefits from such functionality. This article describes a general OS mechanism that may be used to implement a wide variety of online quality management functions. ECalls is a communication mechanism that implements multiple cross-domain calling conventions that can be customized to the quality management needs of applications. The ECalls mechanism is based on the notions of events, event channels, and event handlers. Using events, applications can share relevant QoS attributes with OS services, and OS-level resource management services can efficiently provide monitoring data to target applications or application managers. Dynamically generated event handlers can be used to customize event delivery to meet diverse application needs, for example, to achieve high scalability for Web servers or small jitter for real-time data delivery."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25245","fieldValue":"ACM"}
