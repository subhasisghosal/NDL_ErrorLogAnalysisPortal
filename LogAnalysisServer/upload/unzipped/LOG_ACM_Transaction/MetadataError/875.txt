{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13530","fieldValue":" An ensemble of machine learning classifiers usually improves generalization performance and is useful for many applications. However, the extra memory storage and computational cost incurred from the combined models often limits their potential applications. In this article, we propose a new ensemble reduction method called CANOPY that significantly reduces memory storage and computations. CANOPY uses a technique from logic minimization for digital circuits to select and combine particular classification models from an initial pool in the form of a Boolean function, through which the reduced ensemble performs classification. Experiments on 20 UCI datasets demonstrate that CANOPY either outperforms or is very competitive with the initial ensemble and one state-of-the-art ensemble reduction method in terms of generalization error, and is superior to all existing reduction methods surveyed for identifying the smallest numbers of models in the reduced ensembles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2291","fieldValue":" We consider the following buffer management problem arising in QoS networks: Packets with specified weights and deadlines arrive at a network switch and need to be forwarded so that the total weight of forwarded packets is maximized.

This design-for-testability approach can be used to increase the quality of a test set. This article describes an N-detection test generation procedure for increasing the quality of a transition fault test set in such a circuit. The procedure uses the possibility of applying the same test, with the scan chains operating in different modes, to increase the numbers of detections without increasing the number of tests that need to be generated or stored on a tester. This results in reduced input storage requirements compared with a conventional N-detection test set and an increased number of applied tests. The increased quality of the test set is verified by its bridging fault coverage."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13531","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13531","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13532","fieldValue":"Won, Jae-Yeon"}
