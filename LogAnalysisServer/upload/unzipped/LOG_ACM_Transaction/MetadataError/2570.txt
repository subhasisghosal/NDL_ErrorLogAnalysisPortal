This block triangular form is based on a canonical decomposition of bipartite graphs induced by a maximum matching and was discovered by Dulmage and Mendelsohn. We describe implementations of algorithms to compute the block triangular form and provide computational results on sparse matrices from test collections. Several applications of the block triangular form are also included."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18658","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18658","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18659","fieldValue":" This paper persents a program SERRG2 that solves separable elliptic equations on a rectangle. The program uses a matrix decomposition technique to directly solve the linear system arising from a Rayleigh-Ritz-Galerkin approach with tensor product B-splines to solve the separable partial differential equation. This approach permits high-order discretizations, variable meshes, and multiple knots."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18659","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18659","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18660","fieldValue":" The Level 3 BLAS (BLAS3) are a set of specifications of FORTRAN 77 subprograms for carrying out matrix multiplications and the solution of triangular systems with multiple right-hand sides. They are intended to provide efficient and portable building blocks for linear algebra algorithms on high-performance computers. We describe algorithms for the BLAS3 operations that are asymptotically faster than the conventional ones. These algorithms are based on Strassen's method for fast matrix multiplication, which is now recognized to be a practically useful technique once matrix dimensions exceed about 100. We pay particular attention to the numerical stability of these â\u20ACœfast BLAS3.â\u20AC? Error bounds are given and their significance is explained and illustrated with the aid of numerical experiments. Our conclusion is that the fast BLAS3, although not as strongly stable as conventional implementations, are stable enough to merit careful consideration in many applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18660","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18660","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18661","fieldValue":"ACM"}
