Therefore, handling the erroneouslyrecognized outputs is a key in developing robust spoken-languagesystems. To address this problem, we present a method to improvethe accuracy of speech recognition and performance ofspoken-language applications. The proposed error correctivereranking approach exploits recognition environment characteristicsand domain-specific semantic information to provide robustness andadaptability for a spoken-language system. We demonstrate someexperiments of spoken dialogue tasks and empirical results thatshow an improvement in accuracy for both speech recognition andspoken-language understanding. In our experiment, we show an errorreduction of up to 9.7% and 16.8%; of word error rate, and 5.5% and7.9% of understanding error for the air travel and telebankingservice domains."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20173","fieldValue":" The theory of abstract interpretation provides a formal framework to develop advanced dataflow analysis tools. The idea is to define a nonstandard semantics which is able to compute, in finite time, an approximated model of the program. In this paper, we define an abstract interpretation framework based on a fixpoint approach to the semantics. This leads to the definition, by means of a suitable set of operators, of an abstract fixpoint characterization of a model associated with the program. Thus, we obtain a specializable abstract framework for bottom-up abstract interpretations of definite logic programs. The specialization of the framework is shown on two examples, namely, gound-dependence analysis and depth-k analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20174","fieldValue":" This paper examines cache consistency conditions for multiprocessor shared memory systems.
