{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22253","fieldValue":" Many sensor network applications require sensors' locations to function correctly. Despite the recent advances, location discovery for sensor networks in hostile environments has been mostly overlooked. Most of the existing localization protocols for sensor networks are vulnerable in hostile environments. The security of location discovery can certainly be enhanced by authentication. However, the possible node compromises and the fact that location determination uses certain physical features (e.g., received signal strength) of radio signals make authentication not as effective as in traditional security applications. This article presents two methods to tolerate malicious attacks against range-based location discovery in sensor networks. The first method filters out malicious beacon signals on the basis of the â\u20ACœconsistencyâ\u20AC? among multiple beacon signals, while the second method tolerates malicious beacon signals by adopting an iteratively refined voting scheme. Both methods can survive malicious attacks even if the attacks bypass authentication, provided that the benign beacon signals constitute the majority of the beacon signals. This article also presents the implementation and experimental evaluation (through both field experiments and simulation) of all the secure and resilient location estimation schemes that can be used on the current generation of sensor platforms (e.g., MICA series of motes), including the techniques proposed in this article, in a network of MICAz motes. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and also give the secure and resilient location estimation scheme most suitable for the current generation of sensor networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22254","fieldValue":"apkun, Srdjan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22254","fieldValue":"Srivastava, Mani B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22254","fieldValue":" Time synchronization is critical in sensor networks at many layers of their design. It enables better duty-cycling of the radio, accurate and secure localization, beamforming, and other collaborative signal processing tasks. These benefits make time-synchronization protocols a prime target of malicious adversaries who want to disrupt the normal operation of a sensor network. In this article, we analyze attacks on existing time synchronization protocols for wireless sensor networks and we propose a secure time synchronization toolbox to counter these attacks. This toolbox includes protocols for secure pairwise and group synchronization of nodes that either lie in the neighborhood of each other or are separated by multiple hops. We provide an in-depth analysis of the security and the energy overhead of the proposed protocols. The efficiency of these protocols has been tested through an experimental study on Mica2 motes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22254","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22254","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22255","fieldValue":"Sergot, Marek J"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22255","fieldValue":" Despite their widespread adoption, Role-based Access Control (RBAC) models exhibit certain shortcomings that make them less than ideal for deployment in, for example, distributed access control. In the distributed case, standard RBAC assumptions (e.g., of relatively static access policies, managed by human users, with complete information available about users and job functions) do not necessarily apply. Moreover, RBAC is restricted in the sense that it is based on one type of ascribed status, an assignment of a user to a role. In this article, we introduce the status-based access control (SBAC) model for distributed access control. The SBAC model (or family of models) is based on the notion of users having an action status as well as an ascribed status. A user's action status is established, in part, from a history of events that relate to the user; this history enables changing access policy requirements to be naturally accommodated. The approach can be implemented as an autonomous agent that reasons about the events, actions, and a history (of events and actions), which relates to a requester for access to resources, in order to decide whether the requester is permitted the access sought. We define a number of algebras for composing SBAC policies, algebras that exploit the language that we introduce for SBAC policy representation: identification-based logic programs. The SBAC model is richer than RBAC models and the policies that can be represented in our approach are more expressive than the policies admitted by a number of monotonic languages that have been hitherto described for representing distributed access control requirements. Our algebras generalize existing algebras that have been defined for access policy composition. We also describe an approach for the efficient implementation of SBAC policies."}
