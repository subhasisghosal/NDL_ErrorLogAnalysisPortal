{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6645","fieldValue":" Cyber-Physical Systems are integrations of computation and physical processes and as such, will be increasingly relevant to industry and people. The complexity of designing CPS resides in their heterogeneity. Heterogeneity manifest itself in modeling their functionality as well as in the implementation platforms that include a multiplicity of components such as microprocessors, signal processors, peripherals, memories, sensors and actuators often integrated on a single chip or on a small package such as a multi-chip module. We need a methodology, tools and environments where heterogeneity can be dealt with at all levels of abstraction and where different tools can be integrated. We present here Platform-Based Design as the CPS methodology of choice and metroII, a design environment that supports it. We present the metamodeling approach followed in metroII, how to couple the functionality and implementation platforms of CPS, and the simulation technology that supports the analysis of CPS and of their implementation. We also present examples of use and the integration of metroII with another popular design environment developed at Verimag, BIP."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6645","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6645","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6646","fieldValue":" Cardiac diseases, like those related to abnormal heart rate activity, have an enormous economic and psychological impact worldwide. The approaches used to control the behavior of modern pacemakers ignore the fractal nature of heart rate activity. The purpose of this article is to present a Cyber Physical System approach to pacemaker design that exploits precisely the fractal properties of heart rate activity in order to design the pacemaker controller. Towards this end, we solve a finite horizon optimal control problem based on the heartbeat time series and show that this control problem can be converted into a system of linear equations. We also compare and contrast the performance of the fractal optimal control problem under six different cost functions. Finally, to get an idea of hardware complexity, we implement the fractal optimal controller on a Virtex4 FPGA and report some preliminary results in terms of area overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6646","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6646","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6647","fieldValue":" Reliability in embedded systems is crucial for many application domains. Especially, for safety critical application, as they can be found in the automotive and avionic domain, a high reliability has to be ensured. The technology in chip production undergoes a steady shrinking process from nowadays 25 nanometers. It is proven that coming technologies, which are much smaller, can have a higher defect rate after production, but also at runtime. The physical effects at runtime come from a higher susceptibility for radiation. Since the silicon die of a field programmable gate array (FPGA) includes a high amount of physical wiring, the radiation effect plays here a major role. Therefore, this article describes an approach of a reliable Network-on-Chip (NoC) which can be used for an FPGA-based system. The article describes the concept and the physical realization of this NoC and evaluates its reliability."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6647","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6647","fieldValue":"ACM"}
