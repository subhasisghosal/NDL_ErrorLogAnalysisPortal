The inherent complexities of physiological and pathological networks that span across orders of magnitude in time and length scales, however, represent fundamental hurdles in determining effective treatments for patients. Here we argue for a new approach, called the ACP-based approach, that combines artificial (societies), computational (experiments), and parallel (execution) methods in intelligent systems and technology for integrative and predictive medicine, or more generally, precision medicine and smart health management. The advent of artificial societies that collect the clinically relevant information in prognostics and therapeutics provides a promising platform for organizing and experimenting complex physiological systems toward integrative medicine. The ability of computational experiments to analyze distinct, interactive systems such as the host mechanisms, pathological pathways, and therapeutic strategies, as well as other factors using the artificial systems, will enable control and management through parallel execution of real and arficial systems concurrently within the integrative medicine context. The development of this framework in integrative medicine, fueled by close collaborations between physicians, engineers, and scientists, will result in preventive and predictive practices of a personal, proactive, and precise nature, including rational combinatorial treatments, adaptive therapeutics, and patient-oriented disease management."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7474","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7474","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7475","fieldValue":"Vandeborre, Jean-Philippe"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7475","fieldValue":" Grouping 3D objects into (semantically) meaningful categories is a challenging and important problem in 3D mining and shape processing. Here, we present a novel approach to categorize 3D objects. The method described in this article, is a belief-function-based approach and consists of two stages: the training stage, where 3D objects in the same category are processed and a set of representative parts is constructed, and the labeling stage, where unknown objects are categorized. The experimental results obtained on the Tosca-Sumner and the Shrec07 datasets show that the system efficiently performs in categorizing 3D models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7475","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7475","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7476","fieldValue":"Chia, Liang-Tien"}
