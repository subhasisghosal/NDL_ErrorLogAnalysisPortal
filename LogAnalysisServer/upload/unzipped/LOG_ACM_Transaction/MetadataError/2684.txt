Hence the focus of our research is to design and develop an efficient retrieval technique for phonetic transcriptions. This new technique will make possible widespread utilization of Taiwanese, e.g., in PDA (mobile phone applications). In this paper we propose a minimal perfect hashing function for the 3028 existing Taiwanese phonetic transcriptions. Compared to the hashing designs based on the Chinese remainder theorem for various data sets, the proposed design is shown to be superior in space utilization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2835","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2835","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18969","fieldValue":" Different automatic (also called universal or black-box) methods have been suggested to sample from univariate log-concave distributions. Our new automatic algorithm for bivariate log-concave distributions is based on the method of transformed density rejection. In order to construct a hat function for a rejection algorithm the bivariate density is transformed by the logarithm into a concave function. Then it is possible to construct a dominating function by taking the minimum of several tangent planes, which are by exponentiation transformed back into the original scale. The choice of the points of contact is automated using adaptive rejection sampling. This means that points that are rejected by the rejection algorithm can be used as additional points of contact. The article describes the details how this main idea can be used to construct Algorithm ALC2D that can generate random pairs from all bivariate log-concave distributions with known domain, computable density, and computable partial derivatives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18969","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18969","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18970","fieldValue":"ACM"}
