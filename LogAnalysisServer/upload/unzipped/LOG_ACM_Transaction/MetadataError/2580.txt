All the testproblems had smooth solutions and we assumed dense output was notrequired. The pairs were implemented in a uniform way. In particular,the stepsize selection for all pairs was based on the locally optimalformula. We tested the efficiency of the pairs, to what extent toleranceproportionality held, the accuracy of the local error estimate andstepsize prediction, and the performance on mildly stiff problems. Wealso showed, for these pairs, how the performance could be alterednoticeably by making simple changes to the stepsize selection strategy.As part of the work, we demonstrated new ways of presenting numericalcomparisons."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18693","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18693","fieldValue":"ACM"}
