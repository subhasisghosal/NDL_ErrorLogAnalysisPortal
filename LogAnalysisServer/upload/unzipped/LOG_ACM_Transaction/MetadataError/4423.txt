{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24307","fieldValue":" Although personalization and ubiquity are key properties for on-line services, they challenge the development of these systems due to the complexity of the required architectures. In particular, the current infrastructures for the development of personalized, ubiquitous services are not flexible enough to accommodate the configuration requirements of the various application domains. To address such issues, highly configurable infrastructures are needed.In this article, we describe Seta2000, an infrastructure for the development of recommender systems that support personalized interactions with their users and are accessible from different types of devices (e.g., desktop computers and mobile phones). The Seta2000 infrastructure offers a built-in recommendation engine, based on a multi-agent architecture. Moreover, the infrastructure supports the integration of heterogeneous software and the development of agents that can be configured to offer specialized facilities within a recommender system, but also to dynamically enable and disable such facilities, depending on the requirements of the application domain. The Seta2000 infrastructure has been exploited to develop two prototypes: SeTA is an adaptive Web store personalizing the recommendation and presentation of products in the Web. INTRIGUE is a personalized, ubiquitous information system suggesting attractions to possibly heterogeneous tourist groups."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24308","fieldValue":"Lau, Rynson W H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24308","fieldValue":" A distributed virtual environment (DVE) allows geographically separated users to participate in a shared virtual environment via connected networks. However, when the users are connected by the Internet, bandwidth limitation and network latency may seriously affect the performance and the interactivity of the system. This explains why there are very few DVE applications for the Internet. To address these shortcomings, caching and prefetching techniques are usually employed. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these techniques depends largely on the accuracy of the prediction method used. Although there are a few methods proposed for predicting 3D motion, most of them are primarily designed for predicting the motion of specific objects by assuming certain object motion behaviors. We notice that in desktop DVE applications, such as virtual walkthrough and network gaming, the 2D mouse is still the most popular device used for navigation input. Through studying the motion behavior of a mouse during 3D navigation, we have developed a hybrid motion model for predicting the mouse motion during such navigation---a linear model for prediction at low-velocity motion and an elliptic model for prediction at high-velocity motion. The predicted mouse motion velocity is then mapped to the 3D environment for predicting the user's 3D motion. We describe how this prediction method can be integrated into the caching and prefetching mechanisms of our DVE prototype. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and the resulting caching and prefetching mechanisms through extensive experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24308","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24308","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24309","fieldValue":" Although the interest of a Web page is strictly related to its content and to the subjective readers' cultural background, a measure of the page authority can be provided that only depends on the topological structure of the Web. PageRank is a noticeable way to attach a score to Web pages on the basis of the Web connectivity. In this article, we look inside PageRank to disclose its fundamental properties concerning stability, complexity of computational scheme, and critical role of parameters involved in the computation. Moreover, we introduce a circuit analysis that allows us to understand the distribution of the page score, the way different Web communities interact each other, the role of dangling pages (pages with no outlinks), and the secrets for promotion of Web pages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24309","fieldValue":"ACM"}
