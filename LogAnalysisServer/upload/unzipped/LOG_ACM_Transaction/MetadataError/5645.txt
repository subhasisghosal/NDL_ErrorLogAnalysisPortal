{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5011","fieldValue":" Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is a technique used for the specification and analysis of complex systems. It can be applied directly to biological systems which present these characteristics, including cell transport systems. These systems are structures responsible for exchanging ions through the plasma membrane. Their correct behavior is essential for animal cells, since changes on those are responsible for diseases. In this work, PMC is used to model and analyze the effects of the palytoxin toxin (PTX) interactions with one of these systems. Our model suggests that ATP could inhibit PTX action. Therefore, individuals with ATP deficiencies, such as in brain disorders, may be more susceptible to the toxin. We have also used heat maps to enhance the kinetic model, which is used to describe the system reactions. The map reveals unexpected situations, such as a frequent reaction between unlikely pump states, and hot spots such as likely states and reactions. This type of analysis provides a better understanding on how transmembrane ionic transport systems behave and may lead to the discovery and development of new drugs to treat diseases associated to their incorrect behavior."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5011","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5011","fieldValue":"Probabilistic Model Checking Analysis of Palytoxin Effects on Cell Energy Reactions of the Na+\/K+-ATPase"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5011","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5011","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5012","fieldValue":" In a shotgun proteomics experiment, proteins are the most biologically meaningful output. The success of proteomics studies depends on the ability to accurately and efficiently identify proteins. Many methods have been proposed to facilitate the identification of proteins from peptide identification results. However, the relationship between protein identification and peptide identification has not been thoroughly explained before. In this paper, we devote ourselves to a combinatorial perspective of the protein inference problem. We employ combinatorial mathematics to calculate the conditional protein probabilities (protein probability means the probability that a protein is correctly identified) under three assumptions, which lead to a lower bound, an upper bound, and an empirical estimation of protein probabilities, respectively. The combinatorial perspective enables us to obtain an analytical expression for protein inference. Our method achieves comparable results with ProteinProphet in a more efficient manner in experiments on two data sets of standard protein mixtures and two data sets of real samples. Based on our model, we study the impact of unique peptides and degenerate peptides (degenerate peptides are peptides shared by at least two proteins) on protein probabilities. Meanwhile, we also study the relationship between our model and ProteinProphet. We name our program ProteinInfer.
