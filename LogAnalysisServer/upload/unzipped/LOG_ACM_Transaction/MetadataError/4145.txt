{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23337","fieldValue":" We present Q2P, a system that discovers query templates from search engines via their query autocompletion services. Q2P is distinct from the existing works in that it does not rely on query logs of search engines that are typically not readily available. Q2P is also unique in that it uses a trie to economically store queries sampled from a search engine and employs a beam-search strategy that focuses the expansion of the trie on its most promising nodes. Furthermore, Q2P leverages the trie-based storage of query sample to discover query templates using only two passes over the trie. Q2P is a key part of our ongoing project Deep2Q on a template-driven data integration on the Deep Web, where the templates learned by Q2P are used to guide the integration process in Deep2Q. Experimental results on four major search engines indicate that (1) Q2P sends only a moderate number of queries (ranging from 597 to 1,135) to the engines, while obtaining a significant number of completions per query (ranging from 4.2 to 8.5 on the average); (2) a significant number of templates (ranging from 8 to 32 when the minimum support for frequent templates is set to 1&percnt;) may be discovered from the samples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23338","fieldValue":" Many online collaboration networks struggle to gain user activity and become self-sustaining due to the ramp-up problem or dwindling activity within the system. Prominent examples include online encyclopedias such as (Semantic) MediaWikis, Question and Answering portals such as StackOverflow, and many others. Only a small fraction of these systems manage to reach self-sustaining activity, a level of activity that prevents the system from reverting to a nonactive state. In this article, we model and analyze activity dynamics in synthetic and empirical collaboration networks. Our approach is based on two opposing and well-studied principles: (i) without incentives, users tend to lose interest to contribute and thus, systems become inactive, and (ii) people are susceptible to actions taken by their peers (social or peer influence). With the activity dynamics model that we introduce in this article we can represent typical situations of such collaboration networks. For example, activity in a collaborative network, without external impulses or investments, will vanish over time, eventually rendering the system inactive. However, by appropriately manipulating the activity dynamics and\/or the underlying collaboration networks, we can jump-start a previously inactive system and advance it toward an active state. To be able to do so, we first describe our model and its underlying mechanisms. We then provide illustrative examples of empirical datasets and characterize the barrier that has to be breached by a system before it can become self-sustaining in terms of critical mass and activity dynamics. Additionally, we expand on this empirical illustration and introduce a new metric pâ\u20AC\u201Dthe Activity Momentumâ\u20AC\u201Dto assess the activity robustness of collaboration networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23339","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a comprehensive approach for Quality of Service (QoS) calculation in service composition. Differing from the existing work on QoS aggregations that represent QoS as single values, discrete values with frequencies, or standard statistical distributions, the proposed approach has the capability to handle any type of QoS probability distribution. A set of formulae and algorithms are developed to calculate the QoS of a composite service according to four identified basic patterns as sequential, parallel, conditional, and loop. We demonstrate that the proposed QoS calculation method is much more efficient than existing simulation methods. It has a high scalability and builds a solid foundation for real-time QoS analysis and prediction in service composition. Experiment results are provided to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23340","fieldValue":" We seek to understand the evolving needs of people who are faced with a life-changing medical diagnosis based on analyses of queries extracted from an anonymized search query log. Focusing on breast cancer, we manually tag a set of Web searchers as showing patterns of search behavior consistent with someone grappling with the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer. We build and apply probabilistic classifiers to detect these searchers from multiple sessions and to identify the timing of diagnosis using temporal and statistical features. We explore the changes in information seeking over time before and after an inferred diagnosis of breast cancer by aligning multiple searchers by the estimated time of diagnosis. We employ the classifier to automatically identify 1,700 candidate searchers with an estimated 90&percnt; precision, and we predict the day of diagnosis within 15 days with an 88&percnt; accuracy. We show that the geographic and demographic attributes of searchers identified with high probability are strongly correlated with ground truth of reported incidence rates. We then analyze the content of queries over time for inferred cancer patients, using a detailed ontology of cancer-related search terms. The analysis reveals the rich temporal structure of the evolving queries of people likely diagnosed with breast cancer. Finally, we focus on subtypes of illness based on inferred stages of cancer and show clinically relevant dynamics of information seeking based on the dominant stage expressed by searchers."}
