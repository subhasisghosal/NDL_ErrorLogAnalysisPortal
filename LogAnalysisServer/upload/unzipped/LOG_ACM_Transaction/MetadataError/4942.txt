At the same time, it is crucial that the creative intent of the director is preserved through such changes as much as possible. In this article, we compare several approaches for dynamic range extension to assess their ability to correctly reproduce the color appearance of standard dynamic range (SDR) images on HDR displays. A number of state-of-the-art inverse tone mapping operators (ITMOs) combined with a standard chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) as well as some HDR color appearance models have been evaluated through a psychophysical study, making use of an HDR display as well as HDR ground-truth data. We found that global ITMOs lead to the most reliable performance when combined with a standard CAT, while more complex methods were found to be more scene dependent, and often less preferred than the unprocessed SDR image. HDR color appearance models, albeit being the most complete solutions for accurate color reproduction, were found to not be well suited to the problem of dynamic range expansion, suggesting that further research may be necessary to provide accurate color management in the context of inverse tone mapping."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/3508","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Technicolor (Pouli, Tania; Kervec, Jonathan); Technicolor Research & Innovation and Universit&#233; de Poitiers (Abebe, Mekides Assefa)"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3508","fieldValue":"ITMO"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3509","fieldValue":" High frame-rate (HFR) movie-making refers to the capture and projection of movies at frame rates several times higher than the traditional 24 frames per second. This higher frame rate theoretically improves the quality of motion portrayed in movies, and helps avoid motion blur, judder, and other undesirable artifacts. However, there is considerable debate in the cinema industry regarding the acceptance of HFR content given anecdotal reports of hyper-realistic imagery that reveals too much set and costume detail. Despite the potential theoretical advantages, there has been little empirical investigation of the impact of high frame-rate techniques on the viewer experience. In this study, we use stereoscopic 3D content, filmed and projected at multiple frame rates (24, 48, and 60 fps), with shutter angles ranging from 180° to 358°, to evaluate viewer preferences. In a paired-comparison paradigm, we assessed preferences along a set of five attributes (realism, motion smoothness, blur\/clarity, quality of depth, and overall preference). The resulting data show a clear preference for higher frame rates, particularly when contrasting 24 fps with 48 or 60 fps. We found little impact of shutter angle on viewers' choices, with the exception of one measure (motion smoothness) for one clip type. These data are the first empirical evidence of the advantages afforded by high frame-rate capture and presentation in a cinema context."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3510","fieldValue":"Creem-Regehr, Sarah H."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3510","fieldValue":" Spatial perception research in the real world and in virtual environments suggests that the body (e.g., hands) plays a role in the perception of the scale of the world. However, little research has closely examined how varying the size of virtual body parts may influence judgments of action capabilities and spatial layout. Here, we questioned whether changing the size of virtual feet would affect judgments of stepping over and estimates of the width of a gap. Participants viewed their disembodied virtual feet as small or large and judged both their ability to step over a gap and the size of gaps shown in the virtual world. Foot size affected both affordance judgments and size estimates such that those with enlarged virtual feet estimated they could step over larger gaps and that the extent of the gap was smaller. Shrunken feet led to the perception of a reduced ability to step over a gap and smaller estimates of width. The results suggest that people use their visually perceived foot size to scale virtual spaces. Regardless of foot size, participants felt that they owned the feet rendered in the virtual world. Seeing disembodied, but motion-tracked, virtual feet affected spatial judgments, suggesting that the presentation of a single tracked body part is sufficient to produce similar effects on perception, as has been observed with the presence of fully co-located virtual self-avatars or other body parts in the past."}
