Our technique is efficient, robust to complex light paths, and handles heterogeneous media and anisotropic scattering while provably converging to the correct solution using a bounded memory footprint. We achieve this by extending the recent photon beams variant of volumetric photon mapping. We show how to formulate a progressive radiance estimate using photon beams, providing the convergence guarantees and bounded memory usage of progressive photon mapping. Progressive photon beams can robustly handle situations that are difficult for most other algorithms, such as scenes containing participating media and specular interfaces, with realistic light sources completely enclosed by refractive and reflective materials. Our technique handles heterogeneous media and also trivially supports stochastic effects such as depth-of-field and glossy materials. Finally, we show how progressive photon beams can be implemented efficiently on the GPU as a splatting operation, making it applicable to interactive and real-time applications. These features make our technique scalable, providing the same physically-based algorithm for interactive feedback and reference-quality, unbiased solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2572","fieldValue":" We show that for every fixed j â\u2030¥ i â\u2030¥ 1, the k-Dominating Set problem restricted to graphs that do not have $K_ij (the complete bipartite graph on (i + j) vertices, where the two parts have i and j vertices, respectively) as a subgraph is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) and has a polynomial kernel. We describe a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a Ki,j-free graph G and a nonnegative integer k, constructs a graph H (the â\u20ACœkernelâ\u20AC?) and an integer k' such that (1) G has a dominating set of size at most k if and only if H has a dominating set of size at most k', (2) H has O((j + $1)^i + 1 ki2) vertices, and (3) k' = O((j + 1)i + 1 ki2). Since d-degenerate graphs do not have Kd+1,d+1 as a subgraph, this immediately yields a polynomial kernel on O((d + 2)d+2 k(d + 1)2) vertices for the k-Dominating Set problem on d-degenerate graphs, solving an open problem posed by Alon and Gutner [Alon and Gutner 2008; Gutner 2009]. The most general class of graphs for which a polynomial kernel was previously known for k-Dominating Set is the class of Kh-topological-minor-free graphs [Gutner 2009]. Graphs of bounded degeneracy are the most general class of graphs for which an FPT algorithm was previously known for this problem. Kh-topological-minor-free graphs are Ki,j-free for suitable values of i,j (but not vice-versa), and so our results show that k-Dominating Set has both FPT algorithms and polynomial kernels in strictly more general classes of graphs. Using the same techniques, we also obtain an O(jki$) vertex-kernel for the k-Independent Dominating Set problem on Ki,j$-free graphs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2572","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2572","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16580","fieldValue":"OSullivan, Carol"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16580","fieldValue":" Architecture is design in spatial context. The only current methods for representing context involve designing in a heavyweight computer-aided design system, using a full model of existing buildings and landscape, or sketching on a panoramic photo. The former is too cumbersome; the latter is too restrictive in viewpoint and in the handling of occlusions and topography. We introduce a novel approach to presenting context such that it is an integral component in a lightweight conceptual design system. We represent sites through a fusion of data available from different sources. We derive a site model from geographic elevation data, on-site point-to-point distance measurements, and images of the site. To acquire and process the data, we use publicly available data sources, multidimensional scaling techniques and refinements of recent bundle adjustment techniques. We offer a suite of interactive tools to acquire, process, and combine the data into a lightweight stroke and image-billboard representation. We create multiple and linked pop-ups derived from images, forming a lightweight representation of a three-dimensional environment. We implemented our techniques in a stroke-based conceptual design system we call Insitu. We developed our work through continuous interaction with professional designers. We present designs created with our new techniques integrated in a conceptual design system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16580","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16580","fieldValue":"ACM"}
