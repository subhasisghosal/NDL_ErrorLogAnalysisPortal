Various speech-based navigation techniques have been examined, and several are available in commercial software applications. Among these alternatives, grid-based navigation has demonstrated both potential and limitations. In this article, we discuss an empirical study that assessed the efficacy of two enhancements to grid-based navigation: magnification and fine-tuning. The magnification capability enlarges the selected region when it becomes sufficiently small, making it easier to see the target and cursor. The fine-tuning capability allows users to move the cursor short distances to position the cursor over the target. The study involved one group of participants with physical disabilities, an age-matched group of participants without disabilities, and a third group that included young adults without disabilities. The results confirm that both magnification and fine-tuning significantly improved the participantsâ\u20AC™ performance when selecting targets, especially small targets. Providing either, or both, of the proposed enhancements substantially reduced the gaps in performance due to disability and age. The results will inform the design of speech-based target selection mechanism, allowing users to select targets faster while making fewer errors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1439","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1439","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5148","fieldValue":"Gonzlez-lvarez, David L."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5148","fieldValue":"Vega-Rodrguez, Miguel A."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5148","fieldValue":"Rubio-Largo, lvaro"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5148","fieldValue":" Proteins are molecules that form the mass of living beings. These proteins exist in dissociated forms like amino-acids and carry out various biological functions, in fact, almost all body reactions occur with the participation of proteins. This is one of the reasons why the analysis of proteins has become a major issue in biology. In a more concrete way, the identification of conserved patterns in a set of related protein sequences can provide relevant biological information about these protein functions. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm based on teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) combined with a local search function specialized to predict common patterns in sets of protein sequences. This population-based evolutionary algorithm defines a group of individuals (solutions) that enhance their knowledge (quality) by means of different learning stages. Thus, if we correctly adapt it to the biological context of the mentioned problem, we can get an acceptable set of quality solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed technique, we have used six instances composed of different related protein sequences obtained from the PROSITE database. As we will see, the designed approach makes good predictions and improves the quality of the solutions found by other well-known biological tools."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/5148","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Department of Computer and Communications Technologies, University of Extremadura, Escuela Polit&#233;cnica, Caceres (Gonzlez-lvarez, David L.; Vega-Rodrguez, Miguel A.; Rubio-Largo, lvaro)"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5148","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
