{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23068","fieldValue":" Bilingual lexicons, essential to many NLP applications, can be constructed automatically on the basis of parallel or comparable corpora. In this article, we make two contributions to their induction from comparable corpora. The first one concerns the creation of these lexicons. We show that seed lexicons can be improved by adding a bootstrapping procedure that uses cross-lingual distributional similarity. The second contribution concerns the evaluation of bilingual lexicons. It is generally based on translation lexicons, which corresponds to the implicit assumption that (cross-lingual) synonymy is the semantic relation of primary interest, even though other semantic relations like (cross-lingual) hyponymy or cohyponymy make up a considerable portion of translation pair candidates proposed by distributional methods. We argue that the focus on synonymy is an oversimplification and that many applications can profit from the inclusion of other semantic relations. We study what effect these semantic relations have on two cross-lingual tasks: the cross-lingual projection of polarity scores and the cross-lingual modeling of selectional preferences. We find that the presence of non-synonymous semantic relations may negatively affect the former of these tasks, but benefit the latter."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23068","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23068","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3252","fieldValue":" In this paper, we reflect upon the investigations into external auditory representations of programs (program auralization) reported by Vickers and Alty at ICAD 2000. First, we place the work in its historical and thematic context and explore the motivation that lay behind it. We then outline the process by which we got to the stage of being able to report empirical results in 2000 and compare the work with that done by other researchers in the field. Finally, we assess the major contribution that this work made to the field of auditory display and look to the future outlining the work still to be done since the paper was first published (we also look at work done by others in this area since 2000)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23069","fieldValue":"Van Otterlo, Martijn"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23069","fieldValue":"Moens, Marie-Francine"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23069","fieldValue":" This article reports on the novel task of spatial role labeling in natural language text. It proposes machine learning methods to extract spatial roles and their relations. This work experiments with both a step-wise approach, where spatial prepositions are found and the related trajectors, and landmarks are then extracted, and a joint learning approach, where a spatial relation and its composing indicator, trajector, and landmark are classified collectively. Context-dependent learning techniques, such as a skip-chain conditional random field, yield good results on the GUM-evaluation (Maptask) data and CLEF-IAPR TC-12 Image Benchmark. An extensive error analysis, including feature assessment, and a cross-domain evaluation pinpoint the main bottlenecks and avenues for future research."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23069","fieldValue":"ACM"}
