A challenge to modeling heterogeneous traffic is to develop a traffic model which can accurately characterize these statistical properties, which is computationally efficient, and which is feasible for analysis. This work develops wavelet traffic models for tackling these issues. In specific, we model the wavelet coefficients rather than the original traffic. Our approach is motivated by a discovery that although heterogeneous network traffic has the complicated short- and long-range temporal dependence, the corresponding wavelet coefficients are all \"short-range\" dependent. Therefore, a simple wavelet model may be able to accurately characterize complex network traffic. We first investigate what short-range dependence is important among wavelet coefficients. We then develop the simplest wavelet model, i.e., the independent wavelet model for Gaussian traffic. We define and evaluate the (average) autocorrelation function and the buffer loss probability of the independent wavelet model for Fractional Gaussian Noise (FGN) traffic. This assesses the performance of the independent wavelet model, and the use of which for analysis. We also develop (low-order) Markov wavelet models to capture additional dependence among wavelet coefficients. We show that an independent wavelet model is sufficiently accurate, and a Markov wavelet model only improves the performance marginally. We further extend the wavelet models to non-Gaussian traffic through developing a novel time-scale shaping algorithm. The algorithm is tested using real network traffic and shown to outperform FARIMA in both efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, the wavelet models are parsimonious, and have the computation complexity O(N) in developing a model from a training sequence of length N, and O (M) in generating a synthetic traffic trace of length M."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9055","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9055","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9055","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9056","fieldValue":"Katevenis, Manolis G H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9056","fieldValue":" High-speed switches and routers internally operate using fixed-size cells or segments; variable-size packets are segmented and later reassembled. Connectionless ATM was proposed to quickly carry IP packets segmented into cells (AAL5) using a number of hardware-managed ATM VCs. We show that this is analogous to wormhole routing. We modify this architecture to make it applicable to existing ATM equipment: we propose a low-cost, single-input, single-output Wormhole IP Router that functions as a VP\/VC translation filter between ATM subnetworks. When compared to IP routers, the proposed architecture features simpler hardware and lower latency. When compared to software-based IP-over-ATM techniques, the new architecture avoids the overheads of a large number of labels, or the delays of establishing new flows in software after the first few packets have suffered considerable latencies. We simulated a wormhole IP routing filter, showing that a few tens of hardware-managed VCs per outgoing VP usually suffice. We built and successfully tested a prototype, operating at 2 Ã\u2014 155 Mb\/s, using one field programmable gate array (FPGA) and DRAM. Simple analysis shows that operation at 10 Gb\/s and beyond is feasible today."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9056","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
