Currently one-way constraints are used to provide alignment and distribution tools in many commercial editors. We believe the limitations of these constraints lead to serious usability issues, and thus suggest that such tools be implemented using multi-way constraints. We have conducted two usability studies, the first studies we are aware of that examine the relative usefulness of interactive graphical tools based on one-way and multi-way constraints. They provide strong evidence that multi-way constraint-based alignment and distribution tools are more usable than one-way constraint-based alignment and distribution tools."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5698","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5698","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5699","fieldValue":" Usability inspection techniques are widely used, but few focus on users' thinking and many are appropriate only for particular devices and use contexts. We present a new technique (MOT) that guides inspection by metaphors of human thinking. The metaphors concern habit, the stream of thought, awareness and associations, the relation between utterances and thought, and knowing. The main novelty of MOT is its psychological basis combined with its use of metaphors to stimulate inspection. The first of three experiments shows that usability problems uncovered with MOT are more serious and more complex to repair than problems found with heuristic evaluation. Problems found with MOT are also judged more likely to persist for expert users. The second experiment shows that MOT finds more problems than cognitive walkthrough, and has a wider coverage of a reference collection of usability problems. Participants prefer using MOT over cognitive walkthrough; an important reason being the wider scope of MOT. The third experiment compares MOT, cognitive walkthrough, and think aloud testing, in the context of nontraditional user interfaces. Participants prefer using think aloud testing, but identify few problems with that technique that are not found also with MOT or cognitive walkthrough. MOT identifies more problems than the other techniques. Across experiments and measures of usability problems' utility in systems design, MOT performs better than existing inspection techniques and is comparable to think aloud testing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5699","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5699","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5700","fieldValue":" Notifications can have reduced interruption cost if delivered at moments of lower mental workload during task execution. Cognitive theorists have speculated that these moments occur at subtask boundaries. In this article, we empirically test this speculation by examining how workload changes during execution of goal-directed tasks, focusing on regions between adjacent chunks within the tasks, that is, the subtask boundaries. In a controlled experiment, users performed several interactive tasks while their pupil dilation, a reliable measure of workload, was continuously measured using an eye tracking system. The workload data was extracted from the pupil data, precisely aligned to the corresponding task models, and analyzed. Our principal findings include (i) workload changes throughout the execution of goal-directed tasks; (ii) workload exhibits transient decreases at subtask boundaries relative to the preceding subtasks; (iii) the amount of decrease tends to be greater at boundaries corresponding to the completion of larger chunks of the task; and (iv) different types of subtasks induce different amounts of workload. We situate these findings within resource theories of attention and discuss important implications for interruption management systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5700","fieldValue":"Understanding changes in mental workload during execution of goal-directed tasks and its application for interruption management"}
