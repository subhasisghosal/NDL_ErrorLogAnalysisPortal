Painters and cartographers have developed techniques to create such artistic landscapes for centuries, but the process remains difficult and time-consuming. In this work, we derive principles and heuristics for panorama map creation of mountainous terrain from a perceptual and artistic analysis of two panorama maps of Yellowstone National Park. We then present methods to automatically produce landscape renderings in the visual style of the panorama map. Our algorithms rely on United States Geological Survey (USGS) terrain and classification data. Our surface textures are generated using perceptual metrics and artistic considerations, and use the structural information present in the terrain to guide the automatic placement of image space strokes for natural surfaces such as forests, cliffs, snow, and water."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16140","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16140","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16141","fieldValue":" We design and implement a comprehensive study of the perception of gloss. This is the largest study of its kind to date, and the first to use real material measurements. In addition, we develop a novel multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm for analyzing pairwise comparisons. The data from the psychophysics study and the MDS algorithm is used to construct a low dimensional perceptual embedding of these bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs). The embedding is validated by correlating it with nine gloss dimensions, fitted parameters of seven analytical BRDF models, and a perceptual parameterization of Ward's model. We also introduce a novel perceptual interpolation scheme that uses the embedding to provide the user with an intuitive interface for navigating the space of gloss and constructing new materials."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16141","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16141","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16142","fieldValue":"Xin, Shi-Qing"}
