Therefore, practical techniques, such as test compression and compaction, are required to reduce the amount of test data in order to reduce both the total testing time and memory requirements for the tester. In this article, a new approach to static compaction for combinational circuits, referred to as test vector decomposition (TVD), is proposed. In addition, two new TVD based static compaction algorithms are presented. Experimental results for benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the two new static compaction algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12875","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12876","fieldValue":" We consider issues related to the reduction of scan test data in designs with multiple scan chains. We propose a metric that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of procedures for reducing the scan data volume. The metric compares the achieved compression to the compression which is intrinsic to the use of multiple scan chains. We also propose a procedure for modifying a given test set so as to achieve reductions in test data volume assuming a combinational decompressor circuit."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12877","fieldValue":" We present a dictionary-based test data compression approach for reducing test data volume in SOCs. The proposed method is based on the use of a small number of ATE channels to deliver compressed test patterns from the tester to the chip and to drive a large number of internal scan chains in the circuit under test. Therefore, it is especially suitable for a reduced pin-count and low-cost DFT test environment, where a narrow interface between the tester and the SOC is desirable. The dictionary-based approach not only reduces test data volume but it also eliminates the need for additional synchronization and handshaking between the SOC and the ATE. The dictionary entries are determined during the compression procedure by solving a variant of the well-known clique partitioning problem from graph theory. Experimental results for the ISCAS-89 benchmarks and representative test data from IBM show that the proposed method outperforms a number of recently-proposed test data compression techniques. Compared to the previously proposed test data compression approach based on selective Huffman coding with variable-length indices, the proposed approach generally provides higher compression for the same amount of hardware overhead."}
