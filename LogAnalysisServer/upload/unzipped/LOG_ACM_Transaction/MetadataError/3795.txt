We show that the performance of a KPS can be improved by carefully choosing a certain class of set systems as â\u20ACœkey ring spacesâ\u20AC?. Especially, we analyze KPSs based on a type of combinatorial design known as a transversal design. We employ two types of transversal designs, which are represented by the set of all linear polynomials and the set of quadratic polynomials (over some finite field), respectively. These KPSs turn out to have significant efficiency in a shared-key discovery phase without degrading connectivity and resiliency."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22236","fieldValue":"On the Construction of Practical Key Predistribution Schemes for Distributed Sensor Networks Using Combinatorial Designs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22236","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22236","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22237","fieldValue":"Mano, Chad D"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22237","fieldValue":"Cieslak, David A"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22237","fieldValue":"Salyers, David C"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22237","fieldValue":" Wireless network access has become an integral part of computing both at home and at the workplace. The convenience of wireless network access at work may be extremely beneficial to employees, but can be a burden to network security personnel. This burden is magnified by the threat of inexpensive wireless access points being installed in a network without the knowledge of network administrators. These devices, termed Rogue Wireless Access Points, may allow a malicious outsider to access valuable network resources, including confidential communication and other stored data. For this reason, wireless connectivity detection is an essential capability, but remains a difficult problem. We present a method of detecting wireless hosts using a local RTT metric and a novel packet payload slicing technique. The local RTT metric provides the means to identify physical transmission media while packet payload slicing conditions network traffic to enhance the accuracy of the detections. Most importantly, the packet payload slicing method is transparent to both clients and servers and does not require direct communication between the monitoring system and monitored hosts."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22237","fieldValue":"RIPPS: Rogue Identifying Packet Payload Slicer Detecting Unauthorized Wireless Hosts Through Network Traffic Conditioning"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22237","fieldValue":"ACM"}
