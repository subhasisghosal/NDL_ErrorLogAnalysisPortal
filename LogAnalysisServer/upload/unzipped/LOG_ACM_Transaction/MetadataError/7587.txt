In this paper, this delay is minimized by using a fitting report position (FRP) scheme to adaptively adjust the position of the report message within the transmission window in accordance with the current network load. In the proposed approach, the optimal position of the report message is determined analytically for various system loads. The optical line terminal (OLT) then uses a heuristic algorithm to estimate the load of the optical network units (ONUs) in accordance with their report messages and determines the report message position that minimizes the average packet delay within the network. Finally, the OLT informs the ONUs of the optimal report position through an optional field in the gate message. The performance of the proposed FRP scheme is evaluated for three different network models, namely Poisson traffic with a uniform ONU load, Poisson traffic with a nonuniform ONU load, and self-similar traffic, respectively. The simulation results show that the FRP scheme achieves a lower average packet delay than fixed-report-position schemes such as fixed-report-front (FRF) or fixed-report-end (FRE) for both Poisson and self-similar traffic. The performance improvement is particularly apparent in networks with a nonuniform ONU load distribution."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9983","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9984","fieldValue":" In this paper, we provide and study a general framework that facilitates the development of distributed mechanisms to achieve full utilization of multihop wireless networks. In particular, we describe a generic randomized routing, scheduling, and flow control scheme that allows for a set of imperfections in the operation of the randomized scheduler to account for potential errors in its operation. These imperfections enable the design of a large class of low-complexity and distributed implementations for different interference models. We study the effect of such imperfections on the stability and fairness characteristics of the system and explicitly characterize the degree of fairness achieved as a function of the level of imperfections. Our results reveal the relative importance of different types of errors on the overall system performance and provide valuable insight to the design of distributed controllers with favorable fairness characteristics. In the second part of the paper, we focus on a specific interference model, namely the secondary interference model, and develop distributed algorithms with polynomial communication and computation complexity in the network size. This is an important result given that earlier centralized throughput-optimal algorithms developed for such a model relies on the solution to an NP-hard problem at every decision. This results in a polynomial complexity cross-layer algorithm that achieves throughput optimality and fair allocation of network resources among the users. We further show that our algorithmic approach enables us to efficiently approximate the capacity region of a multihop wireless network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9984","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9984","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9984","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9985","fieldValue":" Service level agreements (SLAs) define performance guarantees made by service providers, e.g., in terms of packet loss, delay, delay variation, and network availability. In this paper, we describe a new active measurement methodology to accurately monitor whether measured network path characteristics are in compliance with performance targets specified in SLAs. Specifically, we: 1) introduce a new methodology for measuring mean delay along a path that improves accuracy over existing methodologies, and a method for obtaining confidence intervals on quantiles of the empirical delay distribution without making any assumption about the true distribution of delay; 2) introduce a new methodology for measuring delay variation that is more robust than prior techniques; 3) describe a new methodology for estimating packet loss rate that significantly improves accuracy over existing approaches; and 4) extend existing work in network performance tomography to infer lower bounds on the quantiles of a distribution of performance measures along an unmeasured path given measurements from a subset of paths. Active measurements for these metrics are unified in a discrete time-based tool called SLAM. The unified probe stream from SLAM consumes lower overall bandwidth than if individual streams are used to measure path properties. We demonstrate the accuracy and convergence properties of SLAM in a controlled laboratory environment using a range of background traffic scenarios and in one- and two-hop settings, and examine its accuracy improvements over existing standard techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9985","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
