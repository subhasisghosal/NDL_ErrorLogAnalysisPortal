{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10554","fieldValue":" There has been a great deal of interest recently in load-balancing switches due to their simple architecture and high forwarding bandwidth. Nevertheless, the mis-sequencing problem of the original load-balancing switch hinders the performance of underlying TCP applications. Several load-balancing switch designs have been proposed to address this mis-sequencing issue. They solve this mis-sequencing problem at the cost of either algorithmic complexity or special hardware requirements. In this paper, we address the mis-sequencing problem by introducing a three-stage load-balancing switch architecture enhanced with an output load-balancing mechanism. This three-stage load-balancing switch achieves a high forwarding capacity while preserving the order of packets without the need of costly online scheduling algorithms. Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that this three-stage load-balancing switch provides a transmission delay that is upper-bounded by that of an output-queued switch plus a constant that depends only on the number of input\/output ports, indicating the same forwarding capacity as an output-queued switch."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10554","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10554","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10554","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10555","fieldValue":" Since wireless channel is vulnerable to eavesdroppers, the secrecy during message delivery is a major concern in many applications such as commercial, governmental, and military networks. This paper investigates information-theoretic secrecy in large-scale networks and studies how capacity is affected by the secrecy constraint where the locations and channel state information (CSI) of eavesdroppers are both unknown. We consider two scenarios: 1) noncolluding case where eavesdroppers can only decode messages individually; and 2) colluding case where eavesdroppers can collude to decode a message. For the noncolluding case, we show that the network secrecy capacity is not affected in order-sense by the presence of eavesdroppers. For the colluding case, the per-node secrecy capacity of $\\Theta({1 \\over \\sqrt{n}})$ can be achieved when the eavesdropper density $\\psi_e(n)$ is $O(n^{-\\beta})$ , for any constant $\\beta > 0$ and decreases monotonously as the density of eavesdroppers increases. The upper bounds on network secrecy capacity are derived for both cases and shown to be achievable by our scheme when $\\psi_e(n)=O(n^{-\\beta})$ or $\\psi_e(n)=\\Omega(\\log^{\\alpha-2 \\over \\alpha}n)$, where $\\alpha$ is the path-loss gain. We show that there is a clear tradeoff between the security constraints and the achievable capacity. Furthermore, we also investigate the impact of secrecy constraint on the capacity of dense network, the impact of active attacks and other traffic patterns, as well as mobility models in the context."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10555","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10555","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10555","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10556","fieldValue":" We study cross-layer design in random-access-based fixed wireless multihop networks under a physical interference model. Due to the complexity of the problem, we consider a simple slotted ALOHA medium access control (MAC) protocol for link-layer operation. We formulate a joint routing, access probability, and rate allocation optimization problem to determine the optimal max-min throughput of the flows and the optimal configuration of the routing, access probability, and transmission rate parameters in a slotted ALOHA system. We then also adapt this problem to include an XOR-like network coding without opportunistic listening. Both problems are complex nonlinear and nonconvex. We provide extensive numerical results for both problems for medium-size mesh networks using an iterated optimal search technique. Via numerical and simulation results, we show that: 1) joint design provides a significant throughput gain over a default configuration in slotted-ALOHA-based wireless networks; and 2) the throughput gain obtained by the simple network coding is significant, especially at low transmission power. We also propose simple heuristics to configure slotted-ALOHA-based wireless mesh networks. These heuristics are extensively evaluated via simulation and found to be very efficient."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10556","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
