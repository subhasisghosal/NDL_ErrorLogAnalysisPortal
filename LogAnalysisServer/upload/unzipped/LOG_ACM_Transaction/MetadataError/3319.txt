{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20918","fieldValue":" We describe the design and implementation of the Exedra continuous media server, and experimentally evaluate alternative resource management policies using a prototype system that we built. Exedra has been designed to provide scalable and efficient support for variable bit-rate media streams whose compression efficiency leads to reduced storage space and bandwidth requirements in comparison to constant bit-rate streams of equivalent quality. We examine alternative disk striping policies, and quantify the benefits of innovative techniques for storage space allocation, buffer management, and resource reservation, which we developed to achieve both predictability and high-performance in handling disk and network data transfers of variable size. Additionally, we investigate the differences between diverse data replication schemes over disk arrays, and compare methods for disk access time reservation that enable tolerance of disk failures at minimal cost. Overall, we demonstrate the feasibility of building network media servers that exploit the latest advances in media compression technology towards reducing the cost of wide-scale streaming services for stored data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20918","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20919","fieldValue":" Ensuring performance isolation and differentiation among workloads that share a storage infrastructure is a basic requirement in consolidated data centers. Existing management tools rely on resource provisioning to meet performance goals; they require detailed knowledge of the system characteristics and the workloads. Provisioning is inherently slow to react to system and workload dynamics and, in the general case, it is not practical to provision for the worst case.We propose a software-only solution that ensures predictable performance for storage access. It is applicable to a wide range of storage systems and makes no assumptions about workload characteristics. We use an online feedback loop with an adaptive controller that throttles storage access requests to ensure that the available system throughput is shared among workloads according to their performance goals and their relative importance. The controller considers the system as a â\u20ACœblack boxâ\u20AC? and adapts automatically to system and workload changes. The controller is distributed to ensure high availability under overload conditions, and it can be used for both block and file access protocols. The evaluation of Triage, our experimental prototype, demonstrates workload isolation and differentiation in an overloaded cluster file-system where workloads and system components are changing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20920","fieldValue":"Long, Darrell D E"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20920","fieldValue":"Schwarz, Thomas J E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20920","fieldValue":" As an emerging nonvolatile secondary storage technology, MEMS-based storage exhibits several desirable properties including high performance, high storage volumic density, low power consumption, low entry cost, and small form factor. However, MEMS-based storage provides a limited amount of storage per device and is likely to be more expensive than magnetic disk. Systems designers will therefore need to make trade-offs to achieve well-balanced designs. We present an architecture in which MEMS devices are organized into MEMS storage enclosures with online spares. Such enclosures are proven to be highly reliable storage building bricks with no maintenance during their economic lifetimes. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using MEMS as another layer in the storage hierarchy, bridging the cost and performance gap between MEMS storage and disk. We show that using MEMS as a disk cache can significantly improve system performance and cost-performance ratio."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20920","fieldValue":"ACM"}
