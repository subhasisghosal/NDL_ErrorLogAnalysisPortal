An ancestral configuration (AC) can be regarded as the multiset of all sequences present at a particular point in time in a possible genealogy for D. The complexity of computing the likelihood of observing D depends heavily on the total number of distinct ACs of D and, therefore, it is of interest to estimate that number. For D consisting of binary sequences of finite length, we consider the problem of enumerating exactly all distinct ACs. We assume that the root sequence type is known and that the mutation process is governed by the infinite-sites model. When there is no recombination, we construct a general method of obtaining closed-form formulas for the total number of ACs. The enumeration problem becomes much more complicated when recombination is involved. In that case, we devise a method of enumeration based on counting contingency tables and construct a dynamic programming algorithm for the approach. Last, we describe a method of counting the number of ACs that can appear in genealogies with less than or equal to a given number R of recombinations. Of particular interest is the case in which R is close to the minimum number of recombinations for D."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4246","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4247","fieldValue":" A heuristic algorithm for finding gene transmission patterns on large and complex pedigrees with partially observed genotype data is proposed. The method can be used to generate an initial point for a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation or to check that the given pedigree and the genotype data are consistent. In small pedigrees, the algorithm is exact by exhaustively enumerating all possibilities, but, in large pedigrees, with a considerable amount of unknown data, only a subset of promising configurations can actually be checked. For that purpose, the configurations are ordered by combining the approximative conditional probability distribution of the unknown genotypes with the information on the relationships between individuals. We also introduce a way to divide the task into subparts, which has been shown to be useful in large pedigrees. The algorithm has been implemented in a program called APE (Allelic Path Explorer) and tested in three different settings with good results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4247","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4247","fieldValue":"Backtracking, heuristic methods, constraint satisfaction, sorting and searching, biology and genetics, pedigree, consistent genotype configuration."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4247","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4247","fieldValue":"ACM"}
