The model describes network dynamics over large parameter variations. The dynamical model is used to analyze the TCP-RED operating point and its stability with respect to various RED controller and system parameters. Bifurcations are shown to occur as system parameters are varied. These bifurcations, which involve the emergence of oscillatory and\/or chaotic behavior, shed light on the parametric sensitivity observed in practice. The bifurcations arise due to the presence of a nonlinearity in the TCP throughput characteristic as a function of drop probability at the gateway. Among the bifurcations observed in the system are period doubling and border collision bifurcations. The bifurcations are studied analytically, numerically, and experimentally."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9271","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9271","fieldValue":"RED"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9271","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1120","fieldValue":" A mathematical formalism is sketched for representing relational structure between agents. n-ary relations, n > 2, require hypernetworks, which generalize binary relation networks. n-ary relations on sets create structure at higher levels of representation to the elements in multilevel systems. The state of a system is represented by its multilevel relational structure. The dynamics of a system are represented by state changes through time. These can be continuous with no change in the hypernetwork topology, but often they are not. Controlling such systems involves taking actions intended to result in desirable state changes. The concept of multilevel hypernetwork can be applied to multiagent systems in general."}
