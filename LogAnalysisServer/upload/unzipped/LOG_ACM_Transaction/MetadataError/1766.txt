A key problem is the approximation of the design surface by a union of patches, so-called panels, that can be manufactured with a selected technology at reasonable cost, while meeting the design intent and achieving the desired aesthetic quality of panel layout and surface smoothness. The production of curved panels is mostly based on molds. Since the cost of mold fabrication often dominates the panel cost, there is strong incentive to use the same mold for multiple panels. We cast the major practical requirements for architectural surface paneling, including mold reuse, into a global optimization framework that interleaves discrete and continuous optimization steps to minimize production cost while meeting user-specified quality constraints. The search space for optimization is mainly generated through controlled deviation from the design surface and tolerances on positional and normal continuity between neighboring panels. A novel 6-dimensional metric space allows us to quickly compute approximate inter-panel distances, which dramatically improves the performance of the optimization and enables the handling of complex arrangements with thousands of panels. The practical relevance of our system is demonstrated by paneling solutions for real, cutting-edge architectural freeform design projects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16251","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16251","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16252","fieldValue":" We propose a technique that takes a triangulated surface as input and outputs a surface with the same topology but altered geometry such that each polygon falls into a set of discrete equivalence classes. We begin by describing an error function that measures how close the polygons are to satisfying this criteria. To optimize this error function, we first cluster triangles into discrete sets such that the assignment of sets minimizes our error. We then find canonical polygons for each set using nonlinear optimization. Next, we solve a Poisson equation to find positions of vertices such that the surface polygons match the canonical polygons as close as possible. We also describe how to incorporate a fairness criteria into the optimization to avoid oscillations of the surface. We iterate this entire process until we reach a user specified tolerance, possibly adding clusters during iteration to guarantee convergence. We have been able to successfully reduce the number of unique triangles to lie within a small percentage of the total number of triangles in the surface and demonstrate our technique on various examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16253","fieldValue":" We introduce an Eulerian liquid simulation framework based on the Voronoi diagram of a potentially unorganized collection of pressure samples. Constructing the simulation mesh in this way allows us to place samples anywhere in the computational domain; we exploit this by choosing samples that accurately capture the geometry and topology of the liquid surface. When combined with high-resolution explicit surface tracking this allows us to simulate nearly arbitrarily thin features, while eliminating noise and other artifacts that arise when there is a resolution mismatch between the simulation and the surface---and allowing a precise inclusion of surface tension based directly on and at the same resolution as the surface mesh. In addition, we present a simplified Voronoi\/Delaunay mesh velocity interpolation scheme, and a direct extension of embedded free surfaces and solid boundaries to Voronoi meshes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16253","fieldValue":"ACM"}
