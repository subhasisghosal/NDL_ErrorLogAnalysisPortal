The input to the problem consists of a floorplan computed using area estimates and the actual area required for each subcircuit of the floorplan. Informally, the objective is to change the areas of the modules without drastically changing their shapes or locations. We show that the constrained polygon transformation problem is NP-hard and present several fast algorithms that produce results within a few percent of a theoretical lower bound on several floorplans."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12807","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12807","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12808","fieldValue":" In this paper, we consider the delay minimization problem of an interconnect wire by simultaneously considering buffer insertion, buffer sizing and wire sizing. We consider three cases, namely using no buffer (i.e., wire sizing alone), using a given number of buffers, and using the optimal number of buffers. We provide elegant closed form optimal solutions for all three problems. These closed form solutions are useful in early stages of the VLSI design flow such as logic synthesis and floorplanning."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12809","fieldValue":" As the sizes of many IC design problems become increasingly larger, approximation has become a valuable approach for arriving at satisfactory results without incurring exorbitant computational cost. In this paper, we present several approximation techniques for solving floorplan area minimization problems. These new techniques enable us to reduce both the time and space complexities of the previously best known approximation algorithms by more than a factor of n and n2 for rectangular and L-shaped subfloorplans, respectively (where n is the number of given implementions). The improvements in the time and space complexities of such approximation techniques is critical to their applicability in floorplan area minimization algorithms. The techniques are quite general, and may be applicable to other classes of approximation problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12809","fieldValue":"ACM"}
