In this paper we study how this sensitivity of the estimator variance to the importance sampling change of measure may be \"dampened\" by combining importance sampling with stochastic approximation based temporal difference (TD) method. We consider a finite state space discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) with one-step transition rewards and an absorbing set of states and focus on estimating the cumulative expected reward to absorption starting from any state. In this setting we develop sufficient conditions under which the estimate resulting from the combined approach has a mean square error that asymptotically equals zero even when the estimate formed by using only importance sampling change of measure has infinite variance. In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the small buffer overflow probability in a queuing network, where the change of measure suggested in literature is shown to have infinite variance under certain parameters and where the appropriate combination of IS and TD method can be empirically seen to have a much faster convergence rate compared to naive simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24892","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24892","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24893","fieldValue":"Lee, Bu-Sung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24893","fieldValue":" Maintaining a consistent view of the simulated world among different simulation nodes is a fundamental problem in large-scale distributed virtual environments (DVEs). In this paper, we characterize this problem by quantifying the time-space inconsistency in a DVE. To this end, a metric is defined to measure the time-space inconsistency in a DVE. One major advantage of the metric is that it may be estimated based on some characteristic parameters of a DVE, such as clock asynchrony, message transmission delay, the accuracy of the dead reckoning algorithm, the kinetics of the moving entity, and human factors. Thus the metric can be used to evaluate the time-space consistency property of a DVE without the actual execution of the DVE application, which is especially useful in the design stage of a DVE. Our work also clearly shows how the characteristic parameters of a DVE are interrelated in deciding the time-space inconsistency, so that we may fine-tune the DVE to make it as consistent as possible. To verify the effectiveness of the metric, a Ping-Pong game is developed. Experimental results show that the metric is effective in evaluating the time-space consistency property of the game."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24894","fieldValue":" Trains operating in densely populated metropolitan areas typically encounter complex trackage configurations. To make optimal use of the available rail capacity, some portions of the rail network may consist of single-track lines while other locations may consist of double- or triple-track lines. Because of varying local conditions, different points in the rail network may have different speed limits. We formulate a graphical technique for modeling such complex rail networks; and we use this technique to develop a deadlock-free algorithm for dispatching each train to its destination with nearly minimal travel time while (a) abiding by the speed limits at each point on each train's route, and (b) maintaining adequate headways between trains. We implemented this train-dispatching algorithm in a simulation model of the movements of passenger and freight trains in Los Angeles County, and we validated the simulation as yielding an adequate approximation to the current system performance."}
