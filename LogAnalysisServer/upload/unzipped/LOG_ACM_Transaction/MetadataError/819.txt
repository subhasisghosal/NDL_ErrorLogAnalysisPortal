This model is designed as a complement to assertion verification, that is, it has the advantage of defining cross-coverage over multiple coverage points. In this article, a coverage-driven verification (CDV) approach is formulated as a simultaneous Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem that is based on covergroups. The coverage bins defined by the functional model are converted into Conjunction Normal Form (CNF) and then solved together by our proposed simultaneous SAT algorithm PLNSAT to generate stimuli for improving coverage. The basic PLNSAT algorithm is then extended in our second proposed algorithm GPLNSAT, which exploits additional information gleaned from the structure of SystemVerilog covergroups. Compared to generating stimuli separately, the simultaneous SAT approaches can share learned knowledge across each coverage target, thus reducing the overall solving time drastically. Experimental results on a UART circuit and the largest ITC benchmark circuits show that the proposed algorithms can achieve 10.8x speedup on average and outperform state-of-the-art techniques in most of the benchmarks."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13404","fieldValue":"Efficient Coverage-Driven Stimulus Generation Using Simultaneous SAT Solving, with Application to SystemVerilog"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13404","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13404","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13405","fieldValue":" Power efficiency is increasingly critical to battery-powered smartphones. Given that the using experience is most valued by the user, we propose that the power optimization should directly respect the user experience. We conduct a statistical sample survey and study the correlation among the user experience, system runtime activities, and computational performance of an application processor. We find that there exists a minimal frequency requirement, called â\u20ACœsaturated frequencyâ\u20AC?. Above this frequency, the device consumes more power but provides little improvements in user experience. This study motivates an intelligent self-adaptive scheme, SmartCap, that automatically identifies the most power-efficient state of the application processor. Compared to prior Linux power adaptation schemes, SmartCap can help save power from 11&percnt; to 84&percnt;, depending on applications, with little decline in user experience."}
