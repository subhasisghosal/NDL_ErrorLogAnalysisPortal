According to the importance of the research topics (e.g., species assignment to genes and document focus species detection), some studies are dedicated to an individual topic. However, no researcher to date has discussed species detection as a general problem. Therefore, we developed a multi-scope species detection model to identify the focus species for different scopes (i.e., gene mention, sentence, paragraph, and global scope of the entire article). Species assignment is one of the bottlenecks of gene name disambiguation. In our evaluation, recognizing the focus species of a gene mention in four different scopes improved the gene name disambiguation. We used the species cue words extracted from articles to estimate the relevance between an article and a species. The relevance score was calculated by our proposed entities frequency-augmented invert species frequency (EF-AISF) formula, which represents the importance of an entity to a species. We also defined a relation guide factor (RGF) to normalize the relevance score. Our method not only achieved better performance than previous methods but also can handle the articles that do not specifically mention a species. In the DECA corpus, we outperformed previous studies and obtained an accuracy of 88.22 percent."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5021","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5021","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5021","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5022","fieldValue":" Genetic recombination is an essential event during the process of meiosis resulting in an exchange of segments between paired chromosomes. Estimating recombination rate is crucial for understanding the process of recombination. Experimental methods are normally difficult and limited to small scale estimations. Thus statistical methods using population genetics data are important for large-scale analysis. LDhat is an extensively used statistical method using jMCMC algorithm to predict recombination rates. Due to the complexity of rjMCMC scheme, LDhat may take a long time for large SNP data sets. In addition, rjMCMC parameters should be manually defined in the original program which directly impact results. To address these issues, we designed an improved algorithm based on LDhat implementing MCMC convergence diagnostic algorithms to automatically predict values of parameters and monitor the mixing process. Then parallel computation methods were employed to further accelerate the new program. The new algorithms have been tested on ten samples from HapMap phase 2 data set. The results were compared with previous code and showed nearly identical output. However, our new methods achieved significant acceleration proving that they are more efficient and reliable for the estimation of recombination rates.
