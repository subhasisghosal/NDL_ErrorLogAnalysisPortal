A spatiotemporal error tolerance map, constructed from psychophysical data based on velocity dependent contrast sensitivity, is used to accelerate rendering. The error map is augmented by a model of visual attention in order to account for the tracking behavior of the eye. Perceptual acceleration combined with good sampling protocols provide a global illumination solution feasible for use in animation. Results indicate an order of magnitude improvement in computational speed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15196","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15196","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15197","fieldValue":"Xu, Ying-Qing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15197","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15197","fieldValue":" We present an algorithm for synthesizing textures from an input sample. This patch-based sampling algorithm is fast and it makes high-quality texture synthesis a real-time process. For generating textures of the same size and comparable quality, patch-based sampling is orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms. The patch-based sampling algorithm works well for a wide variety of textures ranging from regular to stochastic. By sampling patches according to a nonparametric estimation of the local conditional MRF density function, we avoid mismatching features across patch boundaries. We also experimented with documented cases for which pixel-based nonparametric sampling algorithms cease to be effective but our algorithm continues to work well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15197","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15197","fieldValue":"ACM"}
