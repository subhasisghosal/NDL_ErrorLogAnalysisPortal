In this article, we introduce the design, algorithm, and implementation of a novel framework called CURA for quality-retaining power saving on mobile OLED displays. First, we link human visual attention to OLED power saving and model the OLED image scaling optimization problem. The objective is to minimize the power required to display an image without adversely impacting the userâ\u20AC™s visual experience. Then, we present the algorithm used to solve the modeled problem, and prove its optimality even without an accurate power model. Finally, based on the framework, we implement two practical applications on a commercial OLED mobile tablet. The results of experiments conducted on the tablet with real images demonstrate that CURA can reduce significant OLED power consumption while retaining the visual quality of images."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7046","fieldValue":" Sensing platforms are becoming batteryless to enable the vision of the Internet of Things, where trillions of devices collect data, interact with each other, and interact with people. However, these batteryless sensing platformsâ\u20AC\u201Dthat rely purely on energy harvestingâ\u20AC\u201Dare rarely able to maintain a sense of time after a power failure. This makes working with sensor data that is time sensitive especially difficult. We propose two novel, zero-power timekeepers that use remanence decay to measure the time elapsed between power failures. Our approaches compute the elapsed time from the amount of decay of a capacitive device, either on-chip Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) or a dedicated capacitor. This enables hourglass-like timers that give intermittently powered sensing devices a persistent sense of time. Our evaluation shows that applications using either timekeeper can keep time accurately through power failures as long as 45s with low overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7046","fieldValue":"CRFID"}
