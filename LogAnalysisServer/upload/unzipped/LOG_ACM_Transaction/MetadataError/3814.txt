We consider what portions of the policy state must be monitored to detect violations of integrity constraints. Then, we address the fact that not all participants in a trust-management system can be trusted to assist in such monitoring, and show how many integrity constraints can be monitored in a conservative manner so that trusted participants detect and report if the system enters a policy state from which evolution in unmonitored portions of the policy could lead to a constraint violation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3126","fieldValue":" Unsupervised dependency parsing becomes more and more popular in recent years because it does not need expensive annotations, such as treebanks, which are required for supervised and semi-supervised dependency parsing. However, its accuracy is still far below that of supervised dependency parsers, partly due to the fact that their parsing model is insufficient to capture linguistic phenomena underlying texts. The performance for unsupervised dependency parsing can be improved by mining knowledge from the texts and by incorporating it into the model. In this article, syntactic knowledge is acquired from query logs to help estimate better probabilities in dependency models with valence. The proposed method is language independent and obtains an improvement of 4.1&percnt; unlabeled accuracy on the Penn Chinese Treebank by utilizing additional dependency relations from the Sogou query logs and Baidu query logs. Morever, experiments show that the proposed model achieves improvements of 8.07&percnt; on CoNLL 2007 English using the AOL query logs. We believe query logs are useful sources of syntactic knowledge for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22282","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose an access control mechanism for Web-based social networks, which adopts a rule-based approach for specifying access policies on the resources owned by network participants, and where authorized users are denoted in terms of the type, depth, and trust level of the relationships existing between nodes in the network. Different from traditional access control systems, our mechanism makes use of a semidecentralized architecture, where access control enforcement is carried out client-side. Access to a resource is granted when the requestor is able to demonstrate being authorized to do that by providing a proof. In the article, besides illustrating the main notions on which our access control model relies, we present all the protocols underlying our system and a performance study of the implemented prototype."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22282","fieldValue":"ACM"}
