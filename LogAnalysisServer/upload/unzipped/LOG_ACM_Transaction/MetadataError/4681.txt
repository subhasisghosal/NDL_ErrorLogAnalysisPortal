The approach, inspired by computer agent flocking algorithms, can be used to generate inputs to complex simulation models or for generating pseudo-replications of expensive simulation outputs. The method has the flexibility to enable replicated sensitivity analysis for trace-driven simulation, which is critical for risk assessment. The article includes two simple implementations to illustrate the approach. These implementations are applied to nonstationary and state-dependent multivariate time series. Examples using emergency department data are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25091","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25091","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3427","fieldValue":" Manipulated versions of three-dimensional faces that have different profiles, but almost the same appearance in frontal views, provide a novel way to investigate if and how humans use class-specific knowledge to infer depth from images of faces. After seeing a frontal view, participants have to select the profile that matches that view. The profiles are original (ground truth), average, random other, and two solutions computed with a linear face model (3D Morphable Model). One solution is based on 2D vertex positions, the other on pixel colors in the frontal view. The human responses demonstrate that humans neither guess nor just choose the average profile. The results also indicate that humans actually use the information from the front view, and not just rely on the plausibility of the profiles per se. All our findings are perfectly consistent with a correlation-based inference in a linear face model. The results also verify that the 3D reconstructions from our computational algorithms (stimuli 4 and 5) are similar to what humans expect, because they are chosen to be the true profile equally often as the ground-truth profiles. Our experiments shed new light on the mechanisms of human face perception and present a new quality measure for 3D reconstruction algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3427","fieldValue":"Which facial profile do humans expect after seeing a frontal view? a comparison with a linear face model"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3427","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3427","fieldValue":"ACM"}
