The key idea is to develop a measurement-based framework in which the postural position as it pertains to a given wireless link is first inferred based on the measured RF signal strength and packet drops. Then optimal power assignment is done by fitting those measurement results into a model describing the relationship between the assigned power and the resulting signal strength. A closed loop power control mechanism is then added for iterative convergence to the optimal power level as a response to both intra-and-inter posture body movements. This provides a practical paradigm for on-body power assignment, which cannot leverage the existing mechanisms in the literature that rely on localization, which is not realistic for on-body sensors. Extensive experimental results are provided to demonstrate the model building and algorithm performance on a prototype body area network. The proposed mechanism has also been compared with a number of other closed loop mechanisms and an experimental benchmark."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6473","fieldValue":"Transmission power assignment with postural position inference for on-body wireless communication links"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6473","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6473","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1595","fieldValue":"Larriba-Pey, Josep L."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1595","fieldValue":" Fetch engine performance is a key topic in superscalar processors, since it limits the instruction-level parallelism that can be exploited by the execution core. In the search of high performance, the fetch engine has evolved toward more efficient designs, but its complexity has also increased.In this paper, we present the stream fetch engine, a novel architecture based on the execution of long streams of sequential instructions, taking maximum advantage of code layout optimizations. We describe our design in detail, showing that it achieves high fetch performance, while requiring less complexity than other state-of-the-art fetch architectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1595","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1595","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6474","fieldValue":"ACM"}
