However, obtaining such traces presents its own set of challenges owing to either privacy concerns or to other operational difficulties. The key hypothesis of our work here is that most of the information needed to profile the Internet endpoints is already available around us--on the Web. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for profiling and classifying endpoints. We implement and deploy a Google-based profiling tool, that accurately characterizes endpoint behavior by collecting and strategically combining information freely available on the Web. Our Web-based \"unconstrained endpoint profiling\" (UEP) approach shows advances in the following scenarios: 1) even when no packet traces are available, it can accurately infer application and protocol usage trends at arbitrary networks; 2) when network traces are available, it outperforms state-of-the-art classification tools such as BLINC; 3) when sampled flow-level traces are available, it retains high classification capabilities. We explore other complementary UEP approaches, such as p2p- and reverse-DNS-lookup-based schemes, and show that they can further improve the results of the Web-based UEP. Using this approach, we perform unconstrained endpoint profiling at a global scale: for clients in four different world regions (Asia, South and North America, and Europe). We provide the first-of-its-kind endpoint analysis that reveals fascinating similarities and differences among these regions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9986","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9986","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9986","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8392","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9987","fieldValue":" Packet forwarding prioritization (PFP) in routers is one of the mechanisms commonly available to network operators. PFP can have a significant impact on the accuracy of network measurements, the performance of applications and the effectiveness of network troubleshooting procedures. Despite its potential impacts, no information on PFP settings is readily available to end users. In this paper, we present an end-to-end approach for PFP inference and its associated tool, POPI. This is the first attempt to infer router packet forwarding priority through end-to-end measurement. POPI enables users to discover such network policies through measurements of packet losses of different packet types. We evaluated our approach via statistical analysis, simulation and wide-area experimentation in PlanetLab. We employed POPI to analyze 156 paths among 162 PlanetLab sites. POPI flagged 15 paths with multiple priorities, 13 of which were further validated through hop-by-hop loss rates measurements. In addition, we surveyed all related network operators and received responses for about half of them all confirming our inferences. Besides, we compared POPI with the inference mechanisms through other metrics such as packet reordering [called out-of-order (OOO)]. OOO is unable to find many priority paths such as those implemented via traffic policing. On the other hand, interestingly, we found it can detect existence of the mechanisms which induce delay differences among packet types such as slow processing path in the router and port-based load sharing."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9987","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
