The users differ in their utility functions as well as in the perceived quality of service of individual providers. We model the interaction of an arbitrary number of providers and users as a two-stage multi-leader-follower game. We prove existence and uniqueness of the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for a generic channel model and a wide class of users' utility functions. We show that the competition of resource providers leads to a globally optimal outcome under mild technical conditions. Most users will purchase the resource from only one provider at the unique subgame perfect equilibrium. The number of users who connect to multiple providers at the equilibrium is always smaller than the number of providers. We also present a decentralized algorithm that globally converges to the unique system equilibrium with only local information under mild conditions on the update rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10587","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10587","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10587","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10588","fieldValue":"De Cicco, Luca"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10588","fieldValue":" Adaptive video streaming is a relevant advancement with respect to classic progressive download streaming a la YouTube. Among the different approaches, the video stream-switching technique is getting wide acceptance, being adopted by Microsoft, Apple, and popular video streaming services such as Akamai, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and Livestream. In this paper, we present a model of the automatic video stream-switching employed by one of these leading video streaming services along with a description of the client-side communication and control protocol. From the control architecture point of view, the automatic adaptation is achieved by means of two interacting control loops having the controllers at the client and the actuators at the server: One loop is the buffer controller, which aims at steering the client playout buffer to a target length by regulating the server sending rate; the other one implements the stream-switching controller and aims at selecting the video level. A detailed validation of the proposed model has been carried out through experimental measurements in an emulated scenario."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10588","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10588","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10588","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10589","fieldValue":" Many operators run more than one routing instance-- more than one routing protocol, or more than one instance of a given routing protocol--in their networks. Route election and route redistribution are mechanisms introduced by router vendors to interconnect routing instances. We show that these mechanisms do not heed basic performance goals. Especially, we show that, in general, they do not allow network configurations that are simultaneously free from routing anomalies and resilient to failures. We then propose a new form of interconnection that overcomes the limitations of route election and route redistribution, permitting the configuration of a resilient and efficient routing system. We conduct a thorough study of this new form of interconnection, presenting conditions for its correctness and optimality. The precepts of the study are applied to routing instances substantiated by the current Internal Gateway Protocols of the Internet: RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, IGRP, and EIGRP."}
