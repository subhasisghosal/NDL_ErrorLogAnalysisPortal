Moreover, many emerging applications process massive amounts of data with varying degrees of locality. Therefore, exploiting locality to improve on-chip traffic and resource utilization is of fundamental importance. Conventional multicore cache management schemes either manage the private cache (L1) or the Last-Level Cache (LLC), while ignoring the other. We propose a holistic locality-aware cache hierarchy management protocol for large-scale multicores. The proposed scheme improves on-chip data access latency and energy consumption by intelligently bypassing cache line replication in the L1 caches, and\/or intelligently replicating cache lines in the LLC. The approach relies on low overhead yet highly accurate in-hardware runtime classification of data locality at both L1 cache and the LLC. The decision to bypass L1 and\/or replicate in LLC is then based on the measured reuse at the fine granularity of cache lines. The locality tracking mechanism is decoupled from the sharer tracking structures that cause scalability concerns in traditional cache coherence protocols. Moreover, the complexity of the protocol is low since no additional coherence states are created. However, the proposed classifier incurs a 5.6KB per-core storage overhead. On a set of parallel benchmarks, the locality-aware protocol reduces average energy consumption by 26% and completion time by 16%, when compared to the state-of-the-art Reactive-NUCA multicore cache management scheme."}
