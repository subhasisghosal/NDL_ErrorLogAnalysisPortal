However, exactly solving a large MDP is usually intractable due to the â\u20ACœcurse of dimensionalityâ\u20AC?â\u20AC\u201D the state space grows exponentially with the number of state variables. Online algorithms tackle this problem by avoiding computing a policy for the entire state space. On the other hand, since online algorithm has to find a near-optimal action online in almost real time, the computation time is often very limited. In the context of reinforcement learning, MAXQ is a value function decomposition method that exploits the underlying structure of the original MDP and decomposes it into a combination of smaller subproblems arranged over a task hierarchy. In this article, we present MAXQ-OPâ\u20AC\u201Da novel online planning algorithm for large MDPs that utilizes MAXQ hierarchical decomposition in online settings. Compared to traditional online planning algorithms, MAXQ-OP is able to reach much more deeper states in the search tree with relatively less computation time by exploiting MAXQ hierarchical decomposition online. We empirically evaluate our algorithm in the standard Taxi domainâ\u20AC\u201Da common benchmark for MDPsâ\u20AC\u201Dto show the effectiveness of our approach. We have also conducted a long-term case study in a highly complex simulated soccer domain and developed a team named WrightEagle that has won five world champions and five runners-up in the recent 10 years of RoboCup Soccer Simulation 2D annual competitions. The results in the RoboCup domain confirm the scalability of MAXQ-OP to very large domains."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7643","fieldValue":"MAXQ-OP"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7643","fieldValue":"MDP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7643","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7643","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7644","fieldValue":" In recent years, crimes against children and cases of missing children have increased at a high rate. Therefore, there is an urgent need for safety support systems to prevent crimes against children or for antiloss, especially when parents are not with their children, such as to and from school. However, existing childrenâ\u20AC™s tracking systems are not smart enough to provide the safety supports, as they simply locate the childrenâ\u20AC™s positions without offering any notification to parents that their children may be in danger. In addition, there is limited research on childrenâ\u20AC™s tracking and their antiloss. In this article, based on location histories, we introduce novel notions of childrenâ\u20AC™s life patterns that capture their general lifestyles and regularities, and develop an intelligent data mining framework to learn the safe regions and safe routes of children on the cloud side. When the children may be in danger, their parents will receive automatic notifications from the cloud. We also propose an effective energy-efficient positioning scheme that leverages the location tracking accuracy of the children while keeping energy overhead low by using a hybrid global positioning system and a global system for mobile communications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in applying data mining techniques to applications designed for childrenâ\u20AC™s safety. Our proposed techniques have been incorporated into Soter, a childrenâ\u20AC™s safeguard system that is used to provide cloud service for smart bracelets produced by Qihoo. The case studies on real smart bracelet users of Qihoo demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods and Soter for childrenâ\u20AC™s safety."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/7644","fieldValue":"Children&rsquo;s safety"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7644","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7644","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7645","fieldValue":" Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a popular topic modeling technique in academia but less so in industry, especially in large-scale applications involving search engine and online advertising systems. A main underlying reason is that the topic models used have been too small in scale to be useful; for example, some of the largest LDA models reported in literature have up to $10^3 topics, which difficultly cover the long-tail semantic word sets. In this article, we show that the number of topics is a key factor that can significantly boost the utility of topic-modeling systems. In particular, we show that a â\u20ACœbigâ\u20AC? LDA model with at least 105 topics inferred from 109$ search queries can achieve a significant improvement on industrial search engine and online advertising systems, both of which serve hundreds of millions of users. We develop a novel distributed system called Peacock to learn big LDA models from big data. The main features of Peacock include hierarchical distributed architecture, real-time prediction, and topic de-duplication. We empirically demonstrate that the Peacock system is capable of providing significant benefits via highly scalable LDA topic models for several industrial applications."}
