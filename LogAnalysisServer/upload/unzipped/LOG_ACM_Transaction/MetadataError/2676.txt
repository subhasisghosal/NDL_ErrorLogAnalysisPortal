The trapezoidal rule approximation to this integral reduces to a Fourier series.

Besides function values of F (z) for complex and real z, the user has only to provide the numerical value of the Laplace convergence abscissa &sgr;0 or, failing this, an upper bound to this quantity, and the accuracy he or she requires in the computed value of the inverse Transform. The method implemented is based on a Fourier series expansion of the inverse transform, and it is especially suitable when such inverse Laplace Transform is sectionally continuous."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18952","fieldValue":"Algorithm 796: a Fortran software package for the numerical inversion of the Laplace transform based on a Fourier series method"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18952","fieldValue":"ACM"}
