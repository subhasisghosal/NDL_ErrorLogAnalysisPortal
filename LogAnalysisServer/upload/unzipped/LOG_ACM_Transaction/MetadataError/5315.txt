{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1340","fieldValue":" Cloud environments offer low-cost computing resources as a subscription-based service. These resources are elastically scalable and dynamically provisioned. Furthermore, cloud providers have also pioneered new pricing models like spot instances that are cost-effective. As a result, scientific workflows are increasingly adopting cloud computing. However, spot instances are terminated when the market price exceeds the users bid price. Likewise, cloud is not a utopian environment. Failures are inevitable in such large complex distributed systems. It is also well studied that cloud resources experience fluctuations in the delivered performance. These challenges make fault tolerance an important criterion in workflow scheduling. This article presents an adaptive, just-in-time scheduling algorithm for scientific workflows. This algorithm judiciously uses both spot and on-demand instances to reduce cost and provide fault tolerance. The proposed scheduling algorithm also consolidates resources to further minimize execution time and cost. Extensive simulations show that the proposed heuristics are fault tolerant and are effective, especially under short deadlines, providing robust schedules with minimal makespan and cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4419","fieldValue":" Profile HMMs are powerful tools for modeling conserved motifs in proteins. They are widely used by search tools to classify new protein sequences into families based on domain architecture. However, the proliferation of known motifs and new proteomic sequence data poses a computational challenge for search, requiring days of CPU time to annotate an organism's proteome. It is highly desirable to speed up HMM search in large databases. We design PROSITE-like patterns and short profiles that are used as filters to rapidly eliminate protein-motif pairs for which a full profile HMM comparison does not yield a significant match. The design of the pattern-based filters is formulated as a multichoice knapsack problem. Profile-based filters with high sensitivity are extracted from a profile HMM based on their theoretical sensitivity and false positive rate. Experiments show that our profile-based filters achieve high sensitivity (near 100 percent) while keeping around 20\\times speedup with respect to the unfiltered search program. Pattern-based filters typically retain at least 90 percent of the sensitivity of the source HMM with 30-40\\times speedup. The profile-based filters have sensitivity comparable to the multistage filtering strategy HMMERHEAD [15] and are faster in most of our experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4419","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4419","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4419","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4420","fieldValue":" This paper presents Fuzzy-Adaptive-Subspace-Iteration-based Two-way Clustering (FASIC) of microarray data for finding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from two-sample microarray experiments. The concept of fuzzy membership is introduced to transform the hard adaptive subspace iteration (ASI) algorithm into a fuzzy-ASI algorithm to perform two-way clustering. The proposed approach follows a progressive framework to assign a relevance value to genes associated with each cluster. Subsequently, each gene cluster is scored and ranked based on its potential to provide a correct classification of the sample classes. These ranks are converted into P values using the R-test, and the significance of each gene is determined. A fivefold validation is performed on the DEGs selected using the proposed approach. Empirical analyses on a number of simulated microarray data sets are conducted to quantify the results obtained using the proposed approach. To exemplify the efficacy of the proposed approach, further analyses on different real microarray data sets are also performed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4420","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4420","fieldValue":"Clustering, classification and association rules, data mining, data and knowledge visualization, feature extraction or construction."}
