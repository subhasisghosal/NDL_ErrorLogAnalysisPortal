{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16732","fieldValue":" The material found on 3D objects and their parts in our everyday surroundings is highly correlated with the geometric shape of the parts and their relation to other parts of the same object. This work proposes to model this context-dependent correlation by learning it from a database containing several hundreds of objects and their materials. Given a part-based 3D object without materials, the learned model can be used to fully automatically assign plausible material parameters, including diffuse color, specularity, gloss, and transparency. Further, we propose a user interface that provides material suggestions. This user-interface can be used, for example, to refine the automatic suggestion. Once a refinement has been made, the model incorporates this information, and the automatic assignment is incrementally improved. Results are given for objects with different numbers of parts and with different topological complexity. A user study validates that our method significantly simplifies and accelerates the material assignment task compared to other approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16733","fieldValue":" We present a new technique for bi-scale material editing using Spherical Gaussians (SGs). To represent large-scale appearances, an effective BRDF that is the average reflectance of small-scale details is used. The effective BRDF is calculated from the integral of the product of the Bidirectional Visible Normal Distribution (BVNDF) and BRDFs of small-scale geometry. Our method represents the BVNDF with a sum of SGs, which can be calculated on-the-fly, enabling interactive editing of small-scale geometry. By representing small-scale BRDFs with a sum of SGs, effective BRDFs can be calculated analytically by convolving the SGs for BVNDF and BRDF. We propose a new SG representation based on convolution of two SGs, which allows real-time rendering of effective BRDFs under all-frequency environment lighting and real-time editing of small-scale BRDFs. In contrast to the previous method, our method does not require extensive precomputation time and large volume of precomputed data per single BRDF, which makes it possible to implement our method on a GPU, resulting in real-time rendering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16733","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16733","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2586","fieldValue":" We consider the following variant of the classical pattern matching problem: given an uncompressed pattern p[1..m] and a compressed representation of a string t[1..N], does p occur in t? When t is compressed using the LZW method, we are able to detect the occurrence in optimal linear time, thus answering a question of Amir et al. [1994]. Previous results implied solutions with complexities O(n log m + m) Amir et al. [1994], O(n + $m^1+Îµ$) [Kosaraju 1995], or (randomized) O(n log Nn + m) [Farach and Thorup 1995], where n is the size of the compressed representation of t.

Many methods have therefore been proposed for displaying realistic clouds. However, the realism of the resulting images depends on many parameters used to render them and it is often difficult to adjust those parameters manually. This paper proposes a method for addressing this problem by solving an inverse rendering problem: given a non-uniform synthetic cloud density distribution, the parameters for rendering the synthetic clouds are estimated using photographs of real clouds. The objective function is defined as the difference between the color histograms of the photograph and the synthetic image. Our method searches for the optimal parameters using genetic algorithms. During the search process, we take into account the multiple scattering of light inside the clouds. The search process is accelerated by precomputing a set of intermediate images. After ten to twenty minutes of precomputation, our method estimates the optimal parameters within a minute."}
