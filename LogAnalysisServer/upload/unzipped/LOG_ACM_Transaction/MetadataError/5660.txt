We constructed an annotated data set with 34,570 unigenes from B. rapa and predicted 11,526 glucosinolate-related candidate genes using expression profiles generated across nine stages of development on a 47k-gene microarray. Using our multi-layered screening method, we screened 392 transcription factors, 843 pathway genes, and 4,162 ortholog genes associated with glucosinolate-related biosynthesis. Finally, we identified five genes by comparison of the pathway-network genes including the transcription-factor genes and the ortholog-ontology genes. The five genes were anchored to the chromosomes of B. rapa to characterize their genetic-map positions, and phylogenetic reconstruction with homologous genes was performed. These anchored genes were verified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. While the five genes identified by our multi-layered screen require further characterization and validation, our study demonstrates the power of multi-layered screening after initial identification of genes on microarrays."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5039","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
