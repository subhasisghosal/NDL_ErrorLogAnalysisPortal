In this article we draw on interviews with users, reviewers, and establishments to explore how local review Web sites can change interactions around local places. Review Web sites such as Yelp and Tripadvisor allow customers to â\u20ACœprevisitâ\u20AC? establishments and areas of a city before an actual visit. The collection of a large numbers of user-generated reviews has also created a new genre of writing, with reviewers gaining considerable pleasure from passing on word of mouth and influencing othersâ\u20AC™ choices. Reviews also offer a new channel of communication between establishments, customers, and competitors. We discuss how review Web sites can be designed to cater for a broader range of interactions around reviews beyond a focus on recommendations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5808","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5809","fieldValue":"Booth, Kellogg S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5809","fieldValue":" We establish that two-part models of pointing performance (Welfordâ\u20AC™s model) describe pointing on a computer display significantly better than traditional one-part models (Fittsâ\u20AC™s Law). We explore the space of pointing models and describe how independent contributions of movement amplitude and target width to pointing time can be captured in a parameter k. Through a reanalysis of data from related work we demonstrate that one-part formulations are fragile in describing pointing performance, and that this fragility is present for various devices and techniques. We show that this same data can be significantly better described using two-part models. Finally, we demonstrate through further analysis of previous work and new experimental data that k increases linearly with gain. Our primary contribution is the demonstration that Fittsâ\u20AC™s Law is more limited in applicability than previously appreciated, and that more robust models, such as Welfordâ\u20AC™s formulation, should be adopted in many cases of practical interest."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5809","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5809","fieldValue":"ACM"}
