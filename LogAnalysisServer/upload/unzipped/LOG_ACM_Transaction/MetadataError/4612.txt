We consider the many-sources asymptotic regime, that is, the buffer-exceedance threshold B and the service capacity C are scaled by the number of sources (B â\u2030¡ nb and C â\u2030¡ nc).We discuss four methods for simulating the steady-state probability that the buffer threshold is exceeded: the single-twist method (suggested by large deviation theory), the cut-and-twist method (simulating timeslot by timeslot), the random-twist method (the twist is sampled from a discrete distribution), and the sequential-twist method (simulating source by source).The asymptotic efficiency of these four methods is analytically investigated for n â\u2020\u2019 âˆž. A necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the efficiency of the single-twist method, indicating that it is nearly always asymptotically inefficient. The other three methods, however, are asymptotically efficient. We numerically evaluate the four methods by performing a detailed simulation study where it is our main objective to compare the three efficient methods in practical situations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24922","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24922","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3410","fieldValue":" Redirected walking has gained popularity in recent years as a way of enhancing the safety of users immersed in a virtual reality simulation and of extending the amount of space that can be simulated in a virtual environment (VE). Limits imposed by the available physical space and functional tracking area are overcome by inducing immersed users to veer imperceptibly in a way that prevents them from leaving the confines of the tracking space. Redirected walking has been shown to be feasible at levels below noticeable thresholds and to function without increasing the incidence of simulator sickness. The present studies demonstrate that redirected walking can function without negatively impacting memory for spatial locations of landmarks in a VE, despite introducing discrepancies between various spatial senses and distorting the spatial mapping of movement onto the environment. Additionally, the present studies implement what, to our knowledge, is the first generalized redirected walking algorithm that is independent of any task or environment structure, and can adaptively steer users in real time as they engage in spontaneous, unconstrained navigation. The studies also demonstrate that such an algorithm can be implemented successfully in a gymnasium-sized space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24923","fieldValue":"Adan, Ivo J B F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24923","fieldValue":" For statistical inference based on telecommunications network simulation, we examine the effect of a heavy-tailed file-size distribution whose corresponding density follows an inverse power law with exponent Î± &plus; 1, where the shape parameter Î± is strictly between 1 and 2. Representing the session-initiation and file-transmission processes as an infinite-server queueing system with Poisson arrivals, we derive the transient conditional mean and covariance function that describes the number of active sessions as well as the steady-state counterparts of these moments. Assuming the file size (service time) for each session follows the Lomax distribution, we show that the variance of the sample mean for the time-averaged number of active sessions tends to zero as the power of 1 âˆ\u2019 Î± of the simulation run length. Therefore, impractically large sample-path lengths are required to achieve point estimators with acceptable levels of statistical accuracy. This study compares the accuracy of point estimators based on the Lomax distribution with those for lognormal and Weibull file-size distributions whose parameters are determined by matching their means and a selected extreme quantile with those of the Lomax. Both alternatives require shorter run lengths than the Lomax to achieve a given level of accuracy. Although the lognormal requires longer sample paths than the Weibull, it better approximates the Lomax and leads to practicable run lengths in almost all scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/24923","fieldValue":"M\/G\/&infin; queue"}
