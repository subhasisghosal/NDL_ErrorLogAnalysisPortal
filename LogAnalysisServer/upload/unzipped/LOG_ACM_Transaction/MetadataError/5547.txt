Despite several algorithmic advances that have improved the efficiency, its applicability to real data sets has been limited since it does not take into account some important phenomena such as mutations, genotyping errors, and missing data. In this work, we propose the MINIMUM-RECOMBINANT HAPLOTYPE CONFIGURATION WITH BOUNDED ERRORS problem (MRHCE), which extends the original MRHC formulation by incorporating the two most common characteristics of real data: errors and missing genotypes (including untyped individuals). We describe a practical algorithm for MRHCE that is based on a reduction to the well-known Satisfiability problem (SAT) and exploits recent advances in the constraint programming literature. An experimental analysis demonstrates the biological soundness of the phasing model and the effectiveness (on both accuracy and performance) of the algorithm under several scenarios. The analysis on real data and the comparison with state-of-the-art programs reveals that our approach couples better scalability to large and complex pedigrees with the explicit inclusion of genotyping errors into the model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4841","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4841","fieldValue":"Bioinformatics,Accuracy,Algorithm design and analysis,Vectors,Computational biology,Genomics,recombinations,Haplotype inference,pedigrees,genotyping errors,missing data"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4841","fieldValue":"A Fast and Practical Approach to Genotype Phasing and Imputation on a Pedigree with Erroneous and Incomplete Information"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4841","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4841","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4842","fieldValue":" Bioreductive drugs are a class of hypoxia selective drugs that are designed to eradicate the hypoxic fraction of solid tumors. Their activity depends upon a number of biological and pharmacological factors and we used a mathematical modeling approach to explore the dynamics of tumor growth, infusion, and penetration of the bioreductive drug Tirapazamine (TPZ). An in-silico model is implemented to calculate the tumor mass considering oxygen and glucose as key microenvironmental parameters. The next stage of the model integrated extra cellular matrix (ECM), cell-cell adhesion, and cell movement parameters as growth constraints. The tumor microenvironments strongly influenced tumor morphology and growth rates. Once the growth model was established, a hybrid model was developed to study drug dynamics inside the hypoxic regions of tumors. The model used 10, 50 and 100 \\mu {\\rm M} as TPZ initial concentrations and determined TPZ pharmacokinetic (PK) (transport) and pharmacodynamics (cytotoxicity) properties inside hypoxic regions of solid tumor. The model results showed that diminished drug transport is a reason for TPZ failure and recommend the optimization of the drug transport properties in the emerging TPZ generations. The modeling approach used in this study is novel and can be a step to explore the behavioral dynamics of TPZ."}
