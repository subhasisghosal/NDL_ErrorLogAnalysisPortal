These networks are also rich in content, with nodes having distinguished features or attributes. In order to discover a networkâ\u20AC™s modular structure, it is necessary to take into account not only its links but also node attributes. We describe an information-theoretic method that identifies modules by compressing descriptions of information flow on a network. Our formulation introduces node content into the description of information flow, which we then minimize to discover groups of nodes with similar attributes that also tend to trap the flow of information. The method is conceptually simple and does not require ad-hoc parameters to specify the number of modules or to control the relative contribution of links and node attributes to network structure. We apply the proposed method to partition real-world networks with known community structure. We demonstrate that adding node attributes helps recover the underlying community structure in content-rich networks more effectively than using links alone. In addition, we show that our method is faster and more accurate than alternative state-of-the-art algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8082","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8082","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8083","fieldValue":" Feature selection is important in many big data applications. Two critical challenges closely associate with big data. First, in many big data applications, the dimensionality is extremely high, in millions, and keeps growing. Second, big data applications call for highly scalable feature selection algorithms in an online manner such that each feature can be processed in a sequential scan. We present SAOLA, a Scalable and Accurate OnLine Approach for feature selection in this paper. With a theoretical analysis on bounds of the pairwise correlations between features, SAOLA employs novel pairwise comparison techniques and maintains a parsimonious model over time in an online manner. Furthermore, to deal with upcoming features that arrive by groups, we extend the SAOLA algorithm, and then propose a new group-SAOLA algorithm for online group feature selection. The group-SAOLA algorithm can online maintain a set of feature groups that is sparse at the levels of both groups and individual features simultaneously. An empirical study using a series of benchmark real datasets shows that our two algorithms, SAOLA and group-SAOLA, are scalable on datasets of extremely high dimensionality and have superior performance over the state-of-the-art feature selection methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8084","fieldValue":" Advances in smartphone technology have promoted the rapid development of mobile apps. However, the availability of a huge number of mobile apps in application stores has imposed the challenge of finding the right apps to meet the user needs. Indeed, there is a critical demand for personalized app recommendations. Along this line, there are opportunities and challenges posed by two unique characteristics of mobile apps. First, app markets have organized apps in a hierarchical taxonomy. Second, apps with similar functionalities are competing with each other. Although there are a variety of approaches for mobile app recommendations, these approaches do not have a focus on dealing with these opportunities and challenges. To this end, in this article, we provide a systematic study for addressing these challenges. Specifically, we develop a structural user choice model (SUCM) to learn fine-grained user preferences by exploiting the hierarchical taxonomy of apps as well as the competitive relationships among apps. Moreover, we design an efficient learning algorithm to estimate the parameters for the SUCM model. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a large app adoption dataset collected from Google Play. The results show that SUCM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Top-N recommendation methods by a significant margin."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8084","fieldValue":"ACM"}
