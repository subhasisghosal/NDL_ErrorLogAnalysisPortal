While much research has explored parallel recursive filtering, prior techniques do not optimize across the entire filter sequence. Typically, a separate filter (or often a causal-anticausal filter pair) is required in each dimension. Computing these filter passes independently results in significant traffic to global memory, creating a bottleneck in GPU systems. We present a new algorithmic framework for parallel evaluation. It partitions the image into 2D blocks, with a small band of additional data buffered along each block perimeter. We show that these perimeter bands are sufficient to accumulate the effects of the successive filters. A remarkable result is that the image data is read only twice and written just once, independent of image size, and thus total memory bandwidth is reduced even compared to the traditional serial algorithm. We demonstrate significant speedups in GPU computation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16574","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16574","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16575","fieldValue":" This paper unifies multigrid and multilevel (hierarchical) preconditioners, two widely-used approaches for solving computational photography and other computer graphics simulation problems. It provides detailed experimental comparisons of these techniques and their variants, including an analysis of relative computational costs and how these impact practical algorithm performance. We derive both theoretical convergence rates based on the condition numbers of the systems and their preconditioners, and empirical convergence rates drawn from real-world problems. We also develop new techniques for sparsifying higher connectivity problems, and compare our techniques to existing and newly developed variants such as algebraic and combinatorial multigrid. Our experimental results demonstrate that, except for highly irregular problems, adaptive hierarchical basis function preconditioners generally outperform alternative multigrid techniques, especially when computational complexity is taken into account."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16575","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16575","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16576","fieldValue":"Sloan, Peter-Pike"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16576","fieldValue":" Many rendering algorithms willingly sacrifice accuracy, favoring plausible shading with high-performance. Modular Radiance Transfer (MRT) models coarse-scale, distant indirect lighting effects in scene geometry that scales from high-end GPUs to low-end mobile platforms. MRT eliminates scene-dependent precomputation by storing compact transport on simple shapes, akin to bounce cards used in film production. These shapes' modular transport can be instanced, warped and connected on-the-fly to yield approximate light transport in large scenes. We introduce a prior on incident lighting distributions and perform all computations in low-dimensional subspaces. An implicit lighting environment induced from the low-rank approximations is in turn used to model secondary effects, such as volumetric transport variation, higher-order irradiance, and transport through lightfields. MRT is a new approach to precomputed lighting that uses a novel low-dimensional subspace simulation of light transport to uniquely balance the need for high-performance and portable solutions, low memory usage, and fast authoring iteration."}
