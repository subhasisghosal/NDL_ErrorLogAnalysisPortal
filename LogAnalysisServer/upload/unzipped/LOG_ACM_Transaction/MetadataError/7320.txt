The coding capacity is referred to as routing capacity in the case when only routing is allowed. A network is said to achieve its capacity if there is some fractional (k, n) solution for which k\/n equals the capacity. The routing capacity is known to be achievable for arbitrary networks.We give an example of a network whose coding capacity (which is 1) cannot be achieved by a network code. We do this by constructing two networks, one of which is solvable if and only if the alphabet size is odd, and the other of which is solvable if and only if the alphabet size is a power of 2. No linearity assumptions are made."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9458","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9458","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9459","fieldValue":" The max-flow min-cut bound is a fundamental result in the theory of communication networks, which characterizes the optimal throughput for a point-to-point communication network. The recentwork of Ahlswede et al. extended it to single-source multisink multicast networks and Li et al. proved that this bound can be achieved by linear codes. Following this line, Erez and Feder as well as Ngai and Yeung proved that the max-flow min-cut bound remains tight in single-source two-sink nonmulticast networks. But the max-flow min-cut bound is in general quite loose (see Yeung, 2002). On the other hand, the admissible rate region of communication networks has been studied by Yeung and Zhang as well as Song and Yeung, but the bounds obtained by these authors are not explicit. In this work, we prove a new explicit outer bound for arbitrary multisource multisink networks and demonstrate its relation with the minimum cost network coding problem. We also determine the capacity region for a special class of three-layer networks."}
