It is possible to record some of these behaviours automatically, and extract signals that indicate a user is having trouble finding information. This allows for Web site analytics based on user experiences, not just page impressions. A series of experiments identified user browsing behavioursâ\u20AC\u201Dsuch as time taken and amount of scrolling up a pageâ\u20AC\u201Dwhich predict navigation difficulty and which can be recorded with minimal or no changes to existing sites or browsers. In turn, patterns of page views correlate with these signals and these patterns can help Web authors understand where and why their sites are hard to navigate. A new software tool, â\u20ACœLATTE,â\u20AC? automates this analysis and makes it available to Web authors in the context of the site itself."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23306","fieldValue":" Search engines help people answer consequential questions. Biases in retrieved and indexed content (e.g., skew toward erroneous outcomes that represent deviations from reality), coupled with searchers' biases in how they examine and interpret search results, can lead people to incorrect answers. In this article, we seek to better understand biases in search and retrieval, and in particular those affecting the accuracy of content in search results, including the search engine index, features used for ranking, and the formulation of search queries. Focusing on the important domain of online health search, this research broadens previous work on biases in search to examine the role of search systems in contributing to biases. To assess bias, we focus on questions about medical interventions and employ reliable ground truth data from authoritative medical sources. In the course of our study, we utilize large-scale log analysis using data from a popular Web search engine, deep probes of result lists on that search engine, and crowdsourced human judgments of search result captions and landing pages. Our findings reveal bias in results, amplifying searchers' existing biases that appear evident in their search activity. We also highlight significant bias in indexed content and show that specific ranking signals and specific query terms support bias. Both of these can degrade result accuracy and increase skewness in search results. Our analysis has implications for bias mitigation strategies in online search systems, and we offer recommendations for search providers based on our findings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1241","fieldValue":" Distributed protocols executing in uncertain environments, like the Internet or ambient computing systems, should dynamically adapt to environment changes in order to preserve Quality of Service (QoS). In earlier work, it was shown that QoS adaptation should be dependable, if correctness of protocol properties is to be maintained. More recently, some ideas concerning specific strategies and methodologies for improving QoS adaptation have been proposed. In this article we describe Adaptare, a complete framework for dependable QoS adaptation. We assume that during its lifetime, a system alternates periods where its temporal behavior is well characterized, with transition periods during which a variation of the environment conditions occurs. Our method is based on the following: if the environment is generically characterized in analytical terms, and we can detect the alternation of these stable and transient phases, we can improve the effectiveness and dependability of QoS adaptation. To prove our point we provide detailed evaluation results of the proposed solutions. Our evaluation is based on synthetic data flows generated from probabilistic distributions, as well as on real data traces collected in various Internet-based environments. We compare our solution with other approaches and we show that Adaptare, albeit more complex, is very effective, allowing protocols to adapt to the available resources in a dependable way."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1241","fieldValue":"ACM"}
