Such an operation may result in the (often necessary) deletion of additional tuples from the view, besides the intentionally deleted one. The article studies the complexity of deletion propagation, where the view is defined by a conjunctive query (CQ), and the goal is to maximize the number of tuples that remain in the view. Buneman et al. showed that for some simple CQs, this problem can be solved by a straightforward algorithm, which is called here the unidimensional algorithm. The article identifies additional cases of CQs where the unidimensional algorithm sì³®ds, and in contrast, shows that for some other CQs the problem is NP-hard to approximate better than some constant ratio. In fact, it is shown here that among the CQs without self joins, the hard CQs are exactly the ones that the unidimensional algorithm fails on. In other words, the following dichotomy result is proved: for every CQ without self joins, deletion propagation is either APX-hard or solvable (in polynomial time) by the unidimensional algorithm. The article then presents approximation algorithms for certain CQs where deletion propagation is APX-hard. Specifically, two constant-ratio (and polynomial-time) approximation algorithms are given for the class of sunflower CQs (i.e., CQs having a sunflower hypergraph) without self joins. The first algorithm, providing the approximation ratio 1â\u20AC\u2030âˆ\u2019â\u20AC\u20301\/e, is obtained by formulating the problem at hand as that of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid constraint, and then using a known algorithm for such maximization. The second algorithm gives a smaller approximation ratio, 1\/2, yet in polynomial time even under combined complexity. Finally, it is shown that self joins can significantly harden approximation in deletion propagation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14576","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14576","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2386","fieldValue":" We reduce the approximation factor for the vertex cover to 2 âˆ\u2019 Î˜ (1\/&sqrt;logn) (instead of the previous 2 âˆ\u2019 Î˜ ln ln n\/2ln n obtained by Bar-Yehuda and Even [1985] and Monien and Speckenmeyer [1985]). The improvement of the vanishing factor comes as an application of the recent results of Arora et al. [2004] that improved the approximation factor of the sparsest cut and balanced cut problems. In particular, we use the existence of two big and well-separated sets of nodes in the solution of the semidefinite relaxation for balanced cut, proven by Arora et al. [2004]. We observe that a solution of the semidefinite relaxation for vertex cover, when strengthened with the triangle inequalities, can be transformed into a solution of a balanced cut problem, and therefore the existence of big well-separated sets in the sense of Arora et al. [2004] translates into the existence of a big independent set."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2386","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2386","fieldValue":"ACM"}
