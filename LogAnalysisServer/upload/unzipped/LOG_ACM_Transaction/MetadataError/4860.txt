The ability to detect and the perception of and impact of skew on user's quality of experience is analyzed considering user's age, sex, and culture (user profile). The results indicate that skews beyond a certain level between olfaction and video have a negative impact on user-perceived experience. Olfaction before video is more noticeable to users than olfaction after video, and assessors are more tolerable of olfactory data presented after video."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25614","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25614","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25615","fieldValue":" Different 3D tele-immersive (3DTI) activities pose different prioritized requirements for application and network-level quality of service (QoS) to ensure a strong quality of experience (QoE) for participants. Some applications put heavy weight on audio quality, some consider higher quality for upper body video streams, and some seek very low end-to-end interactivity delay. In addition, a variation in streaming content may arise in the 3DTI space due to the participants' change in interests (e.g., view change). Therefore, there is a need for an adaptive multistream, multisite 3DTI session management strategy that is not only unobtrusive, but also optimizes prioritized QoS parameters in 3DTI content distribution based on user activity and content variation. To address this next generation session management problem, we revisit the design space of multistream and multisite 3DTI session layer. We present an evolutionary 3DTI session optimization approach using Open Session Management (OSM) architecture that uses a global view of participants and overlays network conditions to optimize QoS parameters. Experimental results with PlanetLab traces show that our optimization process is unobtrusive, and the optimized TI sessions provide higher satisfaction to the participants (in some cases up to 50&percnt; higher) compared to the current solutions in the 3DTI space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25615","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25615","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1262","fieldValue":" We address the problem of engineering self-organizing electronic institutions for resource allocation in open, embedded, and resource-constrained systems. In such systems, there is decentralized control, competition for resources and an expectation of both intentional and unintentional errors. The â\u20ACœoptimalâ\u20AC? distribution of resources is then less important than the endurance of the distribution mechanism. Under these circumstances, we propose to model resource allocation as a common-pool resource management problem, and develop a formal characterization of Elinor Ostromâ\u20AC™s socio-economic principles for self-governing institutions. This article applies a method for sociologically inspired computing to give a complete axiomatization of six of Ostromâ\u20AC™s eight principles in the Event Calculus. A testbed is implemented for experimenting with the axiomatization. The experimental results show that these principles support enduring institutions, in terms of longevity and membership, and also provide insight into calibrating the transaction and running costs associated with implementing the principles against the behavioral profile of the institutional membership. We conclude that it is possible to express Ostromâ\u20AC™s principles in logical form and that they are necessary and sufficient conditions for enduring self-organizing electronic institutions to manage sustainable common-pool resources."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1262","fieldValue":"Axiomatization of Socio-Economic Principles for Self-Organizing Institutions: Concepts, Experiments and Challenges"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1262","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1262","fieldValue":"ACM"}
