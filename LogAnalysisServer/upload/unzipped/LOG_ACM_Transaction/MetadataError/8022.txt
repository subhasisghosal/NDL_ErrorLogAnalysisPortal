{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10864","fieldValue":" We present the architecture and protocols of ROME, a layer-2 network designed to be backwards-compatible with Ethernet and scalable to tens of thousands of switches and millions of end-hosts. Such large-scale networks are needed for emerging applications including data center networks, wide area networks, and metro Ethernet. ROME is based upon a recently developed greedy routing protocol, greedy distance vector (GDV). Protocol design innovations in ROME include a stateless multicast protocol, a Delaunay distributed hash table (DHT), as well as routing and host discovery protocols for a hierarchical network. ROME protocols do not use broadcast and provide both control-plane and data-plane scalability. Extensive experimental results from a packet-level event-driven simulator, in which ROME protocols are implemented in detail, show that ROME protocols are efficient and scalable to metropolitan size. Furthermore, ROME protocols are highly resilient to network dynamics. The routing latency of ROME is only slightly higher than shortest-path latency. To demonstrate scalability, we provide simulation performance results for ROME networks with up to 25 000 switches and 1.25 million hosts."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10864","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10865","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study, analyze, and evaluate a performance-aware cross-layer design approach for wireless multihop networks. Through network utility maximization (NUM) and weighted network graph modeling, a cross-layer algorithm for performing jointly routing, scheduling, and congestion control is introduced. The performance awareness is achieved by both the appropriate definition of the link weights for the corresponding application's requirements and the introduction of a weighted backpressure (BP) routing\/scheduling. Contrary to the conventional BP, the proposed algorithm scales the congestion gradients with the appropriately defined per-pair (link, destination) weights. We analytically prove the queue stability achieved by the proposed cross-layer scheme, while its convergence to a close neighborhood of the optimal source rates' values is proven via an Îµ-subgradient approach. The issue of the weights' assignment based on various quality-of-service (QoS) metrics is also investigated. Through modeling and simulation, we demonstrate the performance improvements that can be achieved by the proposed approachâ\u20AC\u201Dwhen compared against existing methodologies in the literatureâ\u20AC\u201Dfor two different examples with diverse application requirements, emphasizing respectively on delay and trustworthiness."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10865","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10865","fieldValue":"Performance-aware cross-layer design in wireless multihop networks via a weighted backpressure approach"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10865","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10865","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10866","fieldValue":" By taking advantage of active sensing using radio waves, radar sensors can offer several advantages over passive sensors. Although much attention has been given to multistatic and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar concepts, little has been paid to understanding radar networks (i.e., multiple individual radars working in concert). In this context, we study the coverage problem of a bistatic radar (BR) sensor network, which is very challenging due to the Cassini oval sensing region of a BR and the coupling of sensing regions across different BRs. In particular, we consider the problem of deploying a network of BRs in a region to maximize the worst-case intrusion detectability, which amounts to minimizing the vulnerability of a barrier. We show that it is optimal to place BRs on the shortest barrier if it is the shortest line segment that connects the left and right boundary of the region. Based on this, we study the optimal placement of BRs on a line segment to minimize its vulnerability, which is a nonconvex optimization problem. By exploiting certain specific structural properties pertaining to the problem (particularly an important structure of detectability), we characterize the optimal placement order and the optimal placement spacing of the BR nodes, both of which present elegant balanced structures. Our findings provide valuable insights into the placement of BRs for barrier coverage. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to explore the barrier coverage of a network of BRs."}
