One such augmentation is to provide an organizational memory, some record of the organization's knowledge. However, relatively little is known about how computer systems might enhance organizational, group, or community memory. This article presents Answer Garden, a system for growing organizational memory. The article describes the system and its underlying implementation. It then presents findings from a field study of Answer Garden. The article discusses the usage data and qualitative evaluations from the field study, and then draws a set of lessons for next-generation organizational memory systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23791","fieldValue":"CSCW"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23792","fieldValue":"van Rijsbergen, C.

We present four models based on different notions of probabilistic retrieval. Two of these models are based on classical probability theory and can be considered as prototypes of models long in use in Information Retrieval, like the Vector Space Model and the Probabilistic Model. The two other models are based on a logical technique of evaluating the probability of a conditional called imaging; one is a generalization of the other. We analyze the transfer of probabilities occurring in the term space at retrieval time for these four models, compare their retrieval performance using classical test collections, and discuss the results. We believe that our results provide useful suggestions on how to improve existing probabilistic models of Information Retrieval by taking into consideration term-term similarity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23792","fieldValue":"ACM"}
