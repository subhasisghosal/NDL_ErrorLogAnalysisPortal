Subject to budgetary constraints, the problem is to select a set of regions to conserve so that the phylogenetic diversity of the set of species contained within those regions is maximized. Recently, it was shown in a paper by Moulton {\\\\em et al.} that this problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we establish a tight polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the Nature Reserve Section Problem. Furthermore, we resolve a question on the computational complexity of a related problem left open in Moulton {\\\\em et al.}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4358","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4359","fieldValue":"Hsieh, Yong-Hsiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4359","fieldValue":"Yu, Chih-Chiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4359","fieldValue":"Wang, Biing-Feng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4359","fieldValue":" Let A be a sequence of n real numbers, L1 and L2 be two integers such thatL1 â\u2030¤ L2 , and R1 and R2 be two real numbers such that R1 â\u2030¤ R2. An interval of A is feasible if its length is between L1 and L2 and its average is between R1 and R2. In this paper, we study the following problems: finding all feasible intervals of A, counting all feasible intervals of A, finding a maximum cardinality set of non-overlapping feasible intervals of A, locating a longest feasible interval of A, and locating a shortest feasible interval of A. The problems are motivated from the problem of locating CpG islands in biomolecular sequences. In this paper, we firstly show that all the problems have an Î©(n log n)-time lower bound in the comparison model. Then, we use geometric approaches to design optimal algorithms for the problems. All the presented algorithms run in an on-line manner and use O(n) space."}
