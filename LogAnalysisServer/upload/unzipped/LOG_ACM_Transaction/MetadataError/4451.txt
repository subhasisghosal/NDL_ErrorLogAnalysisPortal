There are a number of issues that have significant impact on distance education, including those from educational, sociological, and psychological perspectives. Rather than attempting to cover exhaustively all the related perspectives, in this survey article, we focus on the technological issues. A number of technology issues are discussed, including distributed learning, collaborative learning, distributed content management, mobile and situated learning, and multimodal interaction and augmented devices for e-learning. Although we have tried to include the state-of-the-art technologies and systems here, it is anticipated that many new ones will emerge in the near future. As such, we point out several emerging issues and technologies that we believe are promising, for the purpose of highlighting important directions for future research."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24378","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24378","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24380","fieldValue":"Engelen, Robert A Van"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24380","fieldValue":" Service-oriented architectures use loosely coupled softwareservices to support the requirements of business processes andsoftware users. Several software engineering challenges have to beovercome to expose legacy C and C++ applications and specializedsystem resources as XML-based software services. It is critical todevise effective bindings between XML and C\/C++ data to efficientlyinteroperate with other XML-based services. Binding applicationdata to XML has many software solutions, ranging from genericdocument object models to idiosyncratic type mappings. A safebinding must conform to XML validation constraints, guarantee typesafety, and should preserve the structural integrity ofcommunicated application data. However, tight XML bindings imposemapping constraints that can hamper interoperability betweenservices. This paper presents a framework for constructing looselycoupled C\/C++ services based on a programming model that integratesXML bindings into the C and C++ syntax. The concepts behind thebindings are generic, which makes the approach applicable to otherprogramming languages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24380","fieldValue":"ACM"}
