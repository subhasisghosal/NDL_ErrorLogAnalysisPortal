Given a sample of writings, drawings, or sketches from the same user, our method improves a user's strokes in real-time as they are drawn. Our approach relies on one main insight. The appearance of the average of multiple instances of the same written word or shape is better than most of the individual instances. We utilize this observation using a two-stage approach. First, we propose an efficient real-time method for finding matching sets of stroke samples called tokens in a potentially large database of writings from a user. Second, we refine the user's most recently written strokes by averaging them with the matching tokens. Our approach works without handwriting recognition, and does not require a database of predefined letters, words, or shapes. Our results show improved results for a wide range of writing styles and drawings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16834","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16834","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16835","fieldValue":" We propose a new method for the large-scale collection and analysis of drawings by using a mobile game specifically designed to collect such data. Analyzing this crowdsourced drawing database, we build a spatially varying model of artistic consensus at the stroke level. We then present a surprisingly simple stroke-correction method which uses our artistic consensus model to improve strokes in real-time. Importantly, our auto-corrections run interactively and appear nearly invisible to the user while seamlessly preserving artistic intent. Closing the loop, the game itself serves as a platform for large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of our stroke correction algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16835","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16835","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16836","fieldValue":" We use a data-driven approach to study both style and abstraction in sketching of a human face. We gather and analyze data from a number of artists as they sketch a human face from a reference photograph. To achieve different levels of abstraction in the sketches, decreasing time limits were imposed -- from four and a half minutes to fifteen seconds. We analyzed the data at two levels: strokes and geometric shape. In each, we create a model that captures both the style of the different artists and the process of abstraction. These models are then used for a portrait sketch synthesis application. Starting from a novel face photograph, we can synthesize a sketch in the various artistic styles and in different levels of abstraction."}
