As with any component-based system, the overall performance and quality of the system is an aggregate function of its component services. In this article, we present a novel approach for managing bottom-up faults in service-based systems. Bottom-up faults are a special case of system-wide exceptions that are defined as abnormal conditions or defects occurring in component services, which if not detected and\/or managed, may lead to runtime failures. Examples of bottom-up faults include network outage, server disruption, and changes to service provisioning (e.g., new operation parameter required) that may have an impact on the way component services are consumed. We propose a soft-state signaling-based approach to propagate these faults from participants to composite services. Soft-state refers to a class of protocols where the state of a service is constantly refreshed by periodic messages, and user\/service takes up the responsibility of communicating and maintaining its state. Soft-state-based protocols have a number of advantages including implicit error recovery and easier fault management, resulting in high availability for systems. Although soft-state has been widely used in various Internet protocols, this work is the first (to the best of our knowledge) to adopt soft-state for fault management in composite services. The proposed approach includes protocols for fault propagation (pure soft-state and soft-state with explicit removal) and fault reaction (rule-based). We also present experiment results to assess the performance and applicability of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24500","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24500","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24501","fieldValue":" We model the design and impact of Internet pricing plans with data caps. We consider a monopoly ISP that maximizes its profit by setting tier prices, tier rates, network capacity, data caps, and overage charges. We show that when data caps are used to maximize profit, a monopoly ISP will keep the basic tier price the same, increase the premium tier rate, and decrease the premium tier price and the basic tier rate. We give analytical and numerical results to illustrate the increase in ISP profit, and the corresponding changes in user tier choices, user surplus, and social welfare."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24501","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24501","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24502","fieldValue":" This article addresses a multi-query optimization problem for distributed medical image retrieval in mobile wireless networks by exploiting the dependencies in the derivation of a retrieval evaluation plan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating batch medical image retrieval (BMIR) processing in a mobile wireless network environment. Four steps are incorporated in our BMIR algorithm. First, when a number of retrieval requests (i.e., m retrieval images and m radii) are simultaneously submitted by users, then a cost-based dynamic retrieval (CDRS) scheduling procedure is invoked to efficiently and effectively identify the correlation among the retrieval spheres (requests) based on a cost model. Next, an index-based image set reduction (ISR) is performed at the execution-node level in parallel. Then, a refinement processing of the candidate images is conducted to get the answers. Finally, at the transmission-node level, the corresponding image fragment (IF) replicas are chosen based on an adaptive multi-resolution (AMR)-based IF replicas selection scheme, and transmitted to the user-node level by a priority-based IF replicas transmission (PIFT) scheme. The experimental results validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm in minimizing the response time and increasing the parallelism of I&sol;O and CPU."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24502","fieldValue":"ACM"}
