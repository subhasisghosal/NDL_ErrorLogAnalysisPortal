The user can model and edit facial expressions by drawing freeform strokes, by specifying distances between facial points, by incrementally editing curves on the face, or by directly dragging facial points in 2D screen space. Designing such an interface for 3D facial modeling and editing is challenging because many unnatural facial expressions might be consistent with the user's input. We formulate the problem in a maximum a posteriori framework by combining the user's input with priors embedded in a large set of facial expression data. Maximizing the posteriori allows us to generate an optimal and natural facial expression that achieves the goal specified by the user. We evaluate the performance of our system by conducting a thorough comparison of our method with alternative facial modeling techniques. To demonstrate the usability of our system, we also perform a user study of our system and compare with state-of-the-art facial expression modeling software (Poser 7)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16217","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16217","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16218","fieldValue":" The behavior of a variety of phenomena measurable on the boundary of 3D shapes is studied by modeling the set of known measurements as a scalar function f :P â\u2020\u2019 R, defined on a surface P. Furthermore, the large amount of scientific data calls for efficient techniques to correlate, describe, and analyze this data. In this context, we focus on the problem of extending the measures captured by a scalar function f, defined on the boundary surface P of a 3D shape, to its surrounding volume. This goal is achieved by computing a sequence of volumetric functions that approximate f up to a specified accuracy and preserve its critical points. More precisely, we compute a smooth map g : $R^3$ â\u2020\u2019 R such that the piecewise linear function h :&equals;gP : P â\u2020\u2019 R, which interpolates the values of g at the vertices of the triangulated surface P, is an approximation of f with the same critical points. In this way, we overcome the limitation of traditional approaches to function approximation, which are mainly based on a numerical error estimation and do not provide measurements of the topological and geometric features of f. The proposed approximation scheme builds on the properties of f related to its global structure, that is, its critical points, and ignores the local details of f, which can be successively introduced according to the target approximation accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16218","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16218","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16219","fieldValue":" The error tolerance of human perception offers a range of opportunities to trade numerical accuracy for performance in physics-based simulation. However, most prior work on perceptual error tolerance either focus exclusively on understanding the tolerance of the human visual system or burden the application developer with case-specific implementations such as Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques. In this article, based on a detailed set of perceptual metrics, we propose a methodology to identify the maximum error tolerance of physics simulation. Then, we apply this methodology in the evaluation of four case studies. First, we utilize the methodology in the tuning of the simulation timestep. The second study deals with tuning the iteration count for the LCP solver. Then, we evaluate the perceptual quality of Fast Estimation with Error Control (FEEC) [Yeh et al. 2006]. Finally, we explore the hardware optimization technique of precision reduction."}
