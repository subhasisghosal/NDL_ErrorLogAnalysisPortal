A robust power management technique must be able to learn the optimal decision from past events and improve itself as the environment changes. This article presents a novel on-line power management technique based on model-free constrained reinforcement learning (Q-learning). The proposed learning algorithm requires no prior information of the workload and dynamically adapts to the environment to achieve autonomous power management. We focus on the power management of the peripheral device and the microprocessor, two of the basic components of a computer. Due to their different operating behaviors and performance considerations, these two types of devices require different designs of Q-learning agent. The article discusses system modeling and cost function construction for both types of Q-learning agent. Enhancement techniques are also proposed to speed up the convergence and better maintain the required performance (or power) constraint in a dynamic system with large variations. Compared with the existing machine learning based power management techniques, the Q-learning based power management is more flexible in adapting to different workload and hardware and provides a wider range of power-performance tradeoff."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/13318","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442087.2442095\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13318","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13318","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13319","fieldValue":" VLIW (very long instruction word) architectures have proven to be useful for embedded applications with abundant instruction level parallelism. But due to the long instruction bus width it often consumes more power and memory space than necessary. One way to lessen this problem is to adopt a reduced bit-width instruction set architecture (ISA) that has a narrower instruction word length. This facilitates a more efficient hardware implementation in terms of area and power by decreasing bus-bandwidth requirements and the power dissipation associated with instruction fetches. In practice, however, it is impossible to convert a given ISA fully into an equivalent reduced bit-width one because the narrow instruction word, due to bit-width restrictions, can encode only a small subset of normal instructions in the original ISA. Consequently, existing processors provide narrow instructions in very limited cases along with severe restrictions on register accessibility. The objective of this work is to explore the possibility of complete conversion, as a case study, of an existing 32-bit VLIW ISA into a 16-bit one that supports effectively all 32-bit instructions. To this objective, we attempt to circumvent the bit-width restrictions by dynamically extending the effective instruction word length of the converted 16-bit operations. Further, we will show that our proposed ISA conversion can create a synergy effect with a VLES (variable length execution set) architecture that is adopted in most recent VLIW processors. According to our experiment, the code size becomes significantly smaller after the conversion to 16-bit VLIW code. Also at a slight run time cost, the machine with the 16-bit ISA consumes much less energy than the original machine."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/13319","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442087.2442096\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13319","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13319","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13320","fieldValue":" This article proposes the first postsilicon customization method for resource binding to achieve power reduction application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) design. Instead of committing to one configuration of resource binding during synthesis, our new synthesis method produces a diverse set of candidate bindings for the design. To ensure diversity of the resource usage patterns, we introduce a binding candidate formation method based on the orthogonal arrays. Additional control components are added to enable post manufacturing selection of one of the binding candidates. The resource binding candidate that minimizes the power consumption is selected by considering the specific power characteristics of each chip. An efficient methodology for embedding several binding candidates in one design is developed. Evaluations on benchmark designs show the low overhead and the effectiveness of the proposed methods. As an example, applying our method results in an average of 14.2&percnt; (up to 24.0&percnt;) power savings on benchmark circuits for a variation model in 45nm CMOS technology. The power efficiency of our customized postsilicon binding is expected to improve with scaling of the technology and the likely resulting higher process variations."}
