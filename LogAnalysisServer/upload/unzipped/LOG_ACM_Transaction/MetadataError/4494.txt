We propose the City Image visualization technique, which builds a transition graph mapping people's movements between location categories, and demonstrate its use to identify similarities and differences of human dynamics across cities by clustering cities according to their citizens' routines. We also analyze centrality metrics of the transition graphs built for different cities, considering transitions between specific venues. We show that these metrics complement the City Image technique, contributing to a deeper understanding of city dynamics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24492","fieldValue":"Leung, Kenneth Wai-Ting"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24492","fieldValue":" Microblogging platforms, such as Twitter, have already played an important role in recent cultural, social and political events. Discovering latent topics from social streams is therefore important for many downstream applications, such as clustering, classification or recommendation. However, traditional topic models that rely on the bag-of-words assumption are insufficient to uncover the rich semantics and temporal aspects of topics in Twitter. In particular, microblog content is often influenced by external information sources, such as Web documents linked from Twitter posts, and often focuses on specific entities, such as people or organizations. These external sources provide useful semantics to understand microblogs and we generally refer to these semantics as auxiliary semantics. In this article, we address the mentioned issues and propose a unified framework for Multifaceted Topic Modeling from Twitter streams. We first extract social semantics from Twitter by modeling the social chatter associated with hashtags. We further extract terms and named entities from linked Web documents to serve as auxiliary semantics during topic modeling. The Multifaceted Topic Model (MfTM) is then proposed to jointly model latent semantics among the social terms from Twitter, auxiliary terms from the linked Web documents and named entities. Moreover, we capture the temporal characteristics of each topic. An efficient online inference method for MfTM is developed, which enables our model to be applied to large-scale and streaming data. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our model compared with state-of-the-art baselines. We evaluate each aspect of our framework and show its utility in the context of tweet clustering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24493","fieldValue":" With the recent popularity of social network services, a significant volume of heterogeneous social media data is generated by users, in the form of texts, photos, videos and collections of points of interest, etc. Such social media data provides users with rich resources for exploring content, such as looking for an interesting video or a favorite point of interest. However, the rapid growth of social media causes difficulties for users to efficiently retrieve their desired media items. Fortunately, users' digital footprints on social networks such as comments massively reflect individual's fine-grained preference on media items, that is, preference on different aspects of the media content, which can then be used for personalized social media search. In this article, we propose SESAME, a fine-grained preference-aware social media search framework leveraging user digital footprints on social networks. First, we collect users' direct feedback on media content from their social networks. Second, we extract users' sentiment about the media content and the associated keywords from their comments to characterize their fine-grained preference. Third, we propose a parallel multituple based ranking tensor factorization algorithm to perform the personalized media item ranking by incorporating two unique features, viz., integrating an enhanced bootstrap sampling method by considering user activeness and adopting stochastic gradient descent parallelization techniques. We experimentally evaluate the SESAME framework using two datasets collected from Foursquare and YouTube, respectively. The results show that SESAME can subtly capture user preference on social media items and consistently outperform baseline approaches by achieving better personalized ranking quality."}
