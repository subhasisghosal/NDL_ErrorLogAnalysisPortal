Recent work focuses on cache misses, overlooking the impact of writebacks on the total memory traffic, energy consumption, IPC, and so forth. Policies that foster a balanced approach, between reducing write traffic to memory and improving miss rates, can increase overall performance and improve energy efficiency and memory system lifetime for NVM memory technology, such as phase-change memory (PCM). We propose Adaptive Replacement and Insertion (ARI), an adaptive approach to last-level CPU cache management, optimizing the two parameters (miss rate and writeback rate) simultaneously. Our specific focus is to reduce writebacks as much as possible while maintaining or improving the miss rate relative to conventional LRU replacement policy. ARI reduces LLC writebacks by 33&percnt;, on average, while also decreasing misses by 4.7&percnt;, on average. In a typical system, this boosts IPC by 4.9&percnt;, on average, while decreasing energy consumption by 8.9&percnt;. These results are achieved with minimal hardware overheads."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1887","fieldValue":"LLC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1887","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1887","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9795","fieldValue":" Given a set of demands between pairs of nodes, we examine the traffic engineering problem of flow routing and fair bandwidth allocation where flows can be split to multiple paths (e.g., MPLS tunnels). This paper presents an algorithm for finding an optimal and global per-commodity max-min fair rate vector in a polynomial number of steps. In addition, we present a fast and novel distributed algorithm where each source router can find the routing and the fair rate allocation for its commodities while keeping the locally optimal max-min fair allocation criteria. The distributed algorithm is a fully polynomial epsilon-approximation (FPTAS) algorithm and is based on a primal-dual alternation technique. We implemented these algorithms to demonstrate its correctness, efficiency, and accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9795","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9795","fieldValue":"ACM"}
