The presence of process variations further exacerbates these problems. In this article, we propose techniques for the efficient evaluation and mitigation of the impact of leakage power variations on the temperature profile of 3D Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs). Experimental results demonstrate that, due to the impact of process variations, a 4-tier 3D implementation can be more than 40Ë\u2020C hotter and 23&percnt; leakier than its 2D counterpart. To determine the maximum temperature of each fabricated 3D IC, we propose an accurate learning-based model for peak temperature prediction. Based on the learning model, we then propose two post-fabrication techniques to increase the thermal yield of 3D CMPs: (1) tier restacking and (2) thermally-aware die matching. Experimental results show that: (1) the proposed prediction model achieves more than 98&percnt; accuracy, and (2) the proposed thermally-aware, post-fabrication optimization techniques significantly improve the thermal yield from only 51&percnt; to 99&percnt; for 3D CMPs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13395","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13396","fieldValue":" Discrete gate sizing has attracted a lot of attention recently as the EDA industry faces the challenge of optimizing large standard cell-based circuits. The discrete nature of the problem, along with complex timing models, stringent design constraints, and ever-increasing circuit sizes, make the problem very difficult to tackle. Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) is an effective technique to handle complex constrained optimization problems and therefore has been successfully applied to solve the gate sizing problem. This article proposes an improved Lagrangian relaxation formulation for discrete gate sizing that relaxes timing, maximum gate input slew, and maximum gate output capacitance constraints. Based on such formulation, we propose a hybrid technique composed of three steps. First, a topological greedy heuristic solves the LR formulation. Such a heuristic is applied assuming a slightly increased target clock period (backoff factor) to better explore the solution space. Second, a delay recovery heuristic reestablishes the original target clock with small power overhead. Third, a power recovery heuristic explores the remaining slacks to further reduce power. Experiments on the ISPD 2012 Contest benchmarks show that our hybrid technique provides less leakage power than the state-of-the-art work for every circuit from the ISPD 2012 Contest infrastructure, achieving up to 24&percnt; less leakage. In addition, our technique achieves a much better compromise between leakage reduction and runtime, obtaining, on average, 9&percnt; less leakage power while running 8.8 times faster."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13396","fieldValue":"ACM"}
