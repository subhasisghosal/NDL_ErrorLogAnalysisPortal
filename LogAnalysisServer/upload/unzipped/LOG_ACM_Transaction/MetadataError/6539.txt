However, spammers are joining this community trying to mislead consumers by writing fake or unfair reviews to confuse the consumers. Previous attempts have used reviewersâ\u20AC™ behaviors such as text similarity and rating patterns, to detect spammers. These studies are able to identify certain types of spammers, for instance, those who post many similar reviews about one target. However, in reality, there are other kinds of spammers who can manipulate their behaviors to act just like normal reviewers, and thus cannot be detected by the available techniques. In this article, we propose a novel concept of review graph to capture the relationships among all reviewers, reviews and stores that the reviewers have reviewed as a heterogeneous graph. We explore how interactions between nodes in this graph could reveal the cause of spam and propose an iterative computation model to identify suspicious reviewers. In the review graph, we have three kinds of nodes, namely, reviewer, review, and store. We capture their relationships by introducing three fundamental concepts, the trustiness of reviewers, the honesty of reviews, and the reliability of stores, and identifying their interrelationships: a reviewer is more trustworthy if the person has written more honesty reviews; a store is more reliable if it has more positive reviews from trustworthy reviewers; and a review is more honest if many other honest reviews support it. This is the first time such intricate relationships have been identified for spam detection and captured in a graph model. We further develop an effective computation method based on the proposed graph model. Different from any existing approaches, we do not use an review text information. Our model is thus complementary to existing approaches and able to find more difficult and subtle spamming activities, which are agreed upon by human judges after they evaluate our results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7426","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7426","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7427","fieldValue":" The popularity of content in social media is unequally distributed, with some items receiving a disproportionate share of attention from users. Predicting which newly-submitted items will become popular is critically important for both the hosts of social media content and its consumers. Accurate and timely prediction would enable hosts to maximize revenue through differential pricing for access to content or ad placement. Prediction would also give consumers an important tool for filtering the content. Predicting the popularity of content in social media is challenging due to the complex interactions between content quality and how the social media site highlights its content. Moreover, most social media sites selectively present content that has been highly rated by similar users, whose similarity is indicated implicitly by their behavior or explicitly by links in a social network. While these factors make it difficult to predict popularity a priori, stochastic models of user behavior on these sites can allow predicting popularity based on early user reactions to new content. By incorporating the various mechanisms through which web sites display content, such models improve on predictions that are based on simply extrapolating from the early votes. Specifically, for one such site, the news aggregator Digg, we show how a stochastic model distinguishes the effect of the increased visibility due to the network from how interested users are in the content. We find a wide range of interest, distinguishing stories primarily of interest to users in the network (â\u20ACœniche interestsâ\u20AC?) from those of more general interest to the user community. This distinction is useful for predicting a storyâ\u20AC™s eventual popularity from usersâ\u20AC™ early reactions to the story."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7427","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7427","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7428","fieldValue":" This article studies the problem of latent community topic analysis in text-associated graphs. With the development of social media, a lot of user-generated content is available with user networks. Along with rich information in networks, user graphs can be extended with text information associated with nodes. Topic modeling is a classic problem in text mining and it is interesting to discover the latent topics in text-associated graphs. Different from traditional topic modeling methods considering links, we incorporate community discovery into topic analysis in text-associated graphs to guarantee the topical coherence in the communities so that users in the same community are closely linked to each other and share common latent topics. We handle topic modeling and community discovery in the same framework. In our model we separate the concepts of community and topic, so one community can correspond to multiple topics and multiple communities can share the same topic. We compare different methods and perform extensive experiments on two real datasets. The results confirm our hypothesis that topics could help understand community structure, while community structure could help model topics."}
