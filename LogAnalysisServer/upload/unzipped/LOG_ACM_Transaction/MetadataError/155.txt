Full system emulators usually use dynamic binary translation to obtain reasonable performance. This paper focuses on optimizing the performance of full system emulators. First, we optimize performance by enabling classic control transfer optimizations of dynamic binary translation in full system emulation, such as indirect branch target caching and block chaining. Second, we improve the performance of memory virtualization of cross-ISA virtual machines by improving the efficiency of the software translation lookaside buffer (software TLB). We implement our optimizations on QEMU, an industrial-strength full system emulator, along with the Android emulator. Experimental results show that our optimizations achieve an average speedup of 1.98X for ARM-to-X86-64 QEMU running SPEC CINT2006 benchmarks with train inputs. Our optimizations also achieve an average speedup of 1.44X and 1.40X for IA32-to-X86-64 QEMU and AArch64-to-X86-64 QEMU on SPEC CINT2006. We use a set of real applications downloaded from Google Play as benchmarks for the Android emulator. Experimental results show that our optimizations achieve an average speedup of 1.43X for the Android emulator running these applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2045","fieldValue":"ACM"}
