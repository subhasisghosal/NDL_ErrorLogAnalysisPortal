AniMesh is suitable for rapid prototyping and easily accessible to non-experts. Source animations can be obtained from commodity motion capture devices or by adapting canned motion sequences. We propose skeleton abstraction and motion retargeting algorithms for finding correspondences and transferring motion between skeletons, or portions of skeletons, with varied topology. Motion can be copied-and-pasted between kinematic chains with different skeletal topologies, and entire model parts can be cut and reattached, while always retaining plausible, composite animations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17443","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17443","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17444","fieldValue":" Photon mapping (PM) has been widely regarded as an efficient solution for light transport simulation, including challenging caustics paths and many-bounce indirect lighting. The efficiency of PM comes from reusing traced photons. However, the handling of photon gathering in existing PM algorithms is universally biased -- the expected value of their results does not necessarily agree with the true solution of the rendering equation. We present a novel photon gathering method to efficiently achieve unbiased rendering with photon mapping. Instead of aggregating the gathered photons into an estimated density as in classical photon mapping, we process each photon individually and connect the corresponding light sub-path with the eye sub-path that generates the gather point, creating an unbiased path sample. The Monte Carlo estimate for such a path sample is calculated by evaluating all relevant terms in a strict and unbiased way, leading to a self-contained unbiased sampling technique. We further develop a set of multiple importance sampling (MIS) weights that allow our method to be optimally combined with bidirectional path tracing (BDPT), resulting in an unbiased rendering algorithm that can efficiently handle a wide variety of light paths and that compares favorably with previous algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our method."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17444","fieldValue":"BDPT"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17444","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17444","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17445","fieldValue":"Li, Tzu-Mao"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17445","fieldValue":" The simulation of light transport in the presence of multi-bounce glossy effects and motion is challenging because the integrand is high dimensional and areas of high-contribution tend to be narrow and hard to sample. We present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) rendering algorithm that extends Metropolis Light Transport by automatically and explicitly adapting to the local shape of the integrand, thereby increasing the acceptance rate. Our algorithm characterizes the local behavior of throughput in path space using its gradient as well as its Hessian. In particular, the Hessian is able to capture the strong anisotropy of the integrand. We obtain the derivatives using automatic differentiation, which makes our solution general and easy to extend to additional sampling dimensions such as time. However, the resulting second order Taylor expansion is not a proper distribution and cannot be used directly for importance sampling. Instead, we use ideas from Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo and simulate the Hamiltonian dynamics in a flipped version of the Taylor expansion where gravity pulls particles towards the high-contribution region. Whereas such methods usually require numerical integration, we show that our quadratic landscape leads to a closed-form anisotropic Gaussian distribution for the final particle positions, and it results in a standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Our method excels at rendering glossy-to-glossy reflections on small and highly curved surfaces. Furthermore, unlike previous work that derives sampling anisotropy with pen and paper and only considers specific effects such as specular BSDFs, we characterize the local shape of throughput through automatic differentiation. This makes our approach very general. In particular, our method is the first MCMC rendering algorithm that is able to resolve the anisotropy in the time dimension and render difficult moving caustics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17445","fieldValue":"ACM"}
