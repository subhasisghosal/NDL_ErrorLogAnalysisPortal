To provide 100% throughput with bounded packet delay, a speedup in the switch fabric is necessary to compensate for both the reconfiguration overhead and the inefficiency of the scheduling algorithm. In order to reduce the implementation cost of the switch, we aim at minimizing the required speedup for a given packet delay bound. Conventional Birkhoff-von Neumann traffic matrix decomposition requires $N^2 - 2N + 2 configurations in the schedule, which lead to a very large packet delay bound. The existing DOUBLE algorithm requires a fixed number of only 2N configurations, but it cannot adjust its schedule according to different switch parameters. In this paper, we first design a generic approach to decompose a traffic matrix into an arbitrary number of Ns (N2$ - 2N + 2 > Ns > N configurations. Then, by taking the reconfiguration overhead into account, we formulate a speedup function. Minimizing the speedup function results in an efficient scheduling algorithm ADAPT. We further observe that the algorithmic efficiency of ADAPT can be improved by better utilizing the switch bandwidth. This leads to a more efficient algorithm SRF (Scheduling Residue First). ADAPT and SRF can automatically adjust the number of configurations in a schedule according to different switch parameters. We show that both algorithms outperform the existing DOUBLE algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9858","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9858","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9858","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9859","fieldValue":" We study the complexity of a set of design problems for optical networks. Under wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology, demands sharing a common fiber are transported on distinct wavelengths. Multiple fibers may be deployed on a physical link. Our basic goal is to design networks of minimum cost, minimum congestion and maximum throughput. This translates to three variants in the design objectives: 1) MIN-SUMFIBER: minimizing the total cost of fibers deployed to carry all demands; 2) MIN-MAXFIBER: minimizing the maximum number of fibers per link to carry all demands; and 3) MAX-THROUGHPUT: maximizing the carried demands using a given set of fibers. We also have two variants in the design constraints: 1) CHOOSEROUTE: Here we need to specify both a routing path and a wavelength for each demand; 2) FIXEDROUTE: Here we are given demand routes and we need to specify wavelengths only. The FIXEDROUTE variant allows us to study wavelength assignment in isolation. Combining these variants, we have six design problems. Previously we have shown that general instances of the problems MIN-SUMFIBER-CHOOSEROUTE and MIN-MAXFIBER-FIXEDROUTE have no constant-approximation algorithms. In this paper, we prove that a similar statement holds for all four other problems. Our main result shows that MIN-SUMFIBER-FIXEDROUTE cannot be approximated within any constant factor unless NP-hard problems have efficient algorithms. This, together with the previous hardness result of MIN-MAXFIBER-FIXEDROUTE, shows that the problem of wavelength assignment is inherently hard by itself. We also study the complexity of problems that arise when multiple demands can be time-multiplexed onto a single wavelength (as in time-domain wavelength interleaved networking (TWIN) networks) and when wavelength converters can be placed along the path of a demand."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9859","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9859","fieldValue":"ACM"}
