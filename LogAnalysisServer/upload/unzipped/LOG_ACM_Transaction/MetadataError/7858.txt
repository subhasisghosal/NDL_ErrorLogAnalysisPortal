This type of traffic exhibits high redundancy with temporal clustering of duplicated packets. The redundancy originates from multiple transfers of the same data chunk over the same link. We propose CacheCast, a link-layer caching mechanism that eliminates the redundant data transmissions using small caches on links. CacheCast's underlying principles are simplicity and reliability. It is a fully distributed and incrementally deployable architecture. It consists of small caches on links that act independently and a server support that simplifies the link cache operation. Our analysis indicates that transfers of the same data to multiple destinations with CacheCast can achieve near-multicast efficiency in terms of consumed link bandwidth. The implementation of CacheCast proves its feasibility, efficiency, and the improvements of the server."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10529","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10530","fieldValue":" In this paper, we focus on the quality-of-service (QoS)-constrained jointly optimal congestion control, network coding, and adaptive distributed power control for connectionless wireless networks affected by multiple access interference (MAI). The goal is to manage the available network resources, so as to support multiple multicast sessions with QoS requirements when intrasession network coding (NC) is allowed. To cope with the nonconvex nature of the resulting cross-layer optimization problem, we propose a two-level decomposition that provides the means to attain the optimal solution through suitable relaxed convex versions of its comprising subproblems. Sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the primary nonconvex problem and its related convex version are derived, occurrence of such conditions investigated, and performance with respect to conventional routing-based layered solutions analyzed. Moreover, we develop a distributed algorithm to compute the actual solution of the resource allocation problem that quickly adapts to network time-evolutions. Performance of this algorithm and its adaptivity are evaluated in the presence of varying network\/fading conditions and noisy measurements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10530","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10530","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10530","fieldValue":"ACM"}
