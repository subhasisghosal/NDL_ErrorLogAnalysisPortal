{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1038","fieldValue":" It is usually claimed that lexical analysis routines are still coded by hand, despite the widespread availability of scanner generators, for efficiency reasons. While efficiency is a consideration, there exist freely available scanner generators such as GLA [Gray 1988] that can generate scanners that are faster than most hand-coded ones. However, most generated scanners are tailored for a particular environment, and retargeting these scanners to other environments, if possible, is usually complex enough to make a hand-coded scanner more appealing. In this paper we describe RE2C, a scanner generator that not only generates scanners that are faster (and usually smaller) than those produced by any other scanner generator known to the authors, including GLA, but that also adapt easily to any environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1038","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1038","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1420","fieldValue":"McCaw, John"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1420","fieldValue":"McCoy, Kathleen F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1420","fieldValue":" Word prediction systems can reduce the number of keystrokes required to form a message in a letter-based AAC system. It has been questioned, however, whether such savings translate into an enhanced communication rate due to the additional overhead (e.g., shifting of focus and repeated scanning of a prediction list) required in using such a system. Our hypothesis is that word prediction has high potential for enhancing AAC communication rate, but the amount is dependent in a complex way on the accuracy of the predictions. Due to significant user interface variations in AAC systems and the potential bias of prior word prediction experience on existing devices, this hypothesis is difficult to verify. We present a study of two different word prediction methods compared against letter-by-letter entry at simulated AAC communication rates. We find that word prediction systems can in fact speed communication rate (an advanced system gave a 58.6&percnt; improvement), and that a more accurate word prediction system can raise the communication rate higher than is explained by the additional accuracy of the system alone due to better utilization (93.6&percnt; utilization for advanced versus 78.2&percnt; for basic)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1420","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1420","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4919","fieldValue":"Gholami Rudi, Ali"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4919","fieldValue":"Razaghi Moghadam Kashani, Zahra"}
