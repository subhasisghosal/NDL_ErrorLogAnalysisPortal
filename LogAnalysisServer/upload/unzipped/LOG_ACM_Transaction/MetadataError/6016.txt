We seek to understand how technologies are used and negotiated among family members and the influence of technology on commensality. We conducted an observational study of six families. The findings showed how technologies are integrated into the mealtime activities. Our study identifies domestic circumstances where background technologies are raised to the foreground, visible devices are hidden, unwanted distractions become desired, and ordinary technologies are integrated into mealtime experiences. We identify four patterns of arrangement between technologies and family members during mealtimes, and we discuss how technologies contribute to mealtime satiety and commensality. Finally, we present implications of our findings and directions for technological advancements focusing on the social and celebratory nature of family mealtimes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5958","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1502","fieldValue":" Mobile sign language video conversations can become unintelligible if high video transmission rates cause network congestion and delayed video. In an effort to understand the perceived lower limits of intelligible sign language video intended for mobile communication, we evaluated sign language video transmitted at four low frame rates (1, 5, 10, and 15 frames per second [fps]) and four low fixed bit rates (15, 30, 60, and 120 kilobits per second [kbps]) at a constant spatial resolution of 320 Ã\u2014 240 pixels. We discovered an â\u20ACœintelligibility ceiling effect,â\u20AC? in which increasing the frame rate above 10fps did not improve perceived intelligibility, and increasing the bit rate above 60kbps produced diminishing returns. Given the study parameters, our findings suggest that relaxing the recommended frame rate and bit rate to 10fps at 60kbps will provide intelligible video conversations while reducing total bandwidth consumption to 25&percnt; of the ITU-T standard (at least 25fps and 100kbps). As part of this work, we developed the Human Signal Intelligibility Model, a new conceptual model useful for informing evaluations of video intelligibility and our methodology for creating linguistically accessible web surveys for deaf people. We also conducted a battery-savings experiment quantifying battery drain when sign language video is transmitted at the lower frame rates and bit rates. Results confirmed that increasing the transmission rates monotonically decreased the battery life."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1502","fieldValue":"Evaluating Intelligibility and Battery Drain of Mobile Sign Language Video Transmitted at Low Frame Rates and Bit Rates"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5959","fieldValue":"Al-Akkad, Amro"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5959","fieldValue":" The availability of ICT services can be severely disrupted in the aftermath of disasters. Ad-hoc assemblages of communication technology have the potential to bridge such breakdowns. This article investigates the use of an ad-hoc system for sending SOS signals in a large-scale exercise that simulated a terrorist attack. In this context, we found that the sensitivity that was introduced by the adversarial nature of the situation posed unexpected challenges for our approach, as giving away one's location in the immediate danger of a terrorist attack became an issue both for first responders and the affected people in the area. We show how practices of calling for help and reacting to help calls can be affected by such a system and affect the management of the visibility and validity of SOS calls, implying a need for further negotiation in situations where communication is sensitive and technically restrained."}
