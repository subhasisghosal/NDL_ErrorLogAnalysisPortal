These behaviors are seen in such everyday materials as shampoo, dough, and clay as well as in fantastic gooey and blobby creatures in special effects scenes. To account for plastic deformation, we explicitly update the linear basis functions defined over the finite elements during each simulation step. When these updates cause the basis functions to become ill-conditioned, we remesh the simulation domain to produce a new high-quality finite-element mesh, taking care to preserve the original boundary. We also introduce an enhanced plasticity model that preserves volume and includes creep and work hardening\/softening. We demonstrate our approach with simulations of synthetic objects that squish, dent, and flow. To validate our methods, we compare simulation results to videos of real materials."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2495","fieldValue":" We consider packet networks with limited buffer space at the nodes, and are interested in the question of maximizing the number of packets that arrive to destination rather than being dropped due to full buffers. We initiate a more refined analysis of the throughput competitive ratio of admission and scheduling policies in the Competitive Network Throughput model [Aiello et al. 2005], taking into account not only the network size but also the buffer size and the injection rate of the traffic. We specifically consider the problem of information gathering on the line, with limited buffer space, under adversarial traffic. We examine how the buffer size and the injection rate of the traffic affect the performance of the greedy protocol for this problem. We establish upper bounds on the competitive ratio of the greedy protocol in terms of the network size, the buffer size, and the adversary's rate, and present lower bounds which are tight up to constant factors. These results show, for example, that provisioning the network with sufficiently large buffers may substantially improve the performance of the greedy protocol in some cases, whereas for some high-rate adversaries, using larger buffers does not have any effect on the competitive ratio of the protocol."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15773","fieldValue":"Anjyo, Ken-ichi"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15773","fieldValue":" Recent progress in non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) has led to many stylized shading techniques that efficiently convey visual information about the objects depicted. Another crucial goal of NPR is to give artists simple and direct ways to express the abstract ideas born of their imaginations. In particular, the ability to add intentional, but often unrealistic, shading effects is indispensable for many applications. We propose a set of simple stylized shading algorithms that allow the user to freely add localized light and shade to a model in a manner that is consistent and seamlessly integrated with conventional lighting techniques. The algorithms provide an intuitive, direct manipulation method based on a paint-brush metaphor, to control and edit the light and shade locally as desired. Our prototype system demonstrates how our method can enhance both the quality and range of applicability of conventional stylized shading for offline animation and interactive applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15773","fieldValue":"ACM"}
