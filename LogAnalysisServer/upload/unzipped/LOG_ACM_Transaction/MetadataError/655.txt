The consequences of this interleaving (or global time) assumption on the specifications and proofs of distributed programs are examined in this paper. A construction for atomic registers is presented; this construction has the surprising property that it is correct with respect to a specification based on partial orders but is incorrect with respect to a naively derived specification based on global time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1152","fieldValue":" An indulgent algorithm is a distributed algorithm that, besides tolerating process failures, also tolerates unreliable information about the interleaving of the processes. This article presents a general characterization of indulgence in an abstract computing model that encompasses various communication and resilience schemes. We use our characterization to establish several results about the inherent power and limitations of indulgent algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1152","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1152","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13036","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13036","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13036","fieldValue":"ACM"}
