A key activity in the requirements engineering (RE) process for such a project is to demonstrate that all relevant requirements have been elicited from the regulatory documents and have been traced to the contract as well as to the target system components. That is, the requirements have met regulatory compliance. However, there are impediments to achieving this level of compliance due to such complexity factors as voluminous contract, large number of regulatory documents, and multiple domains of the system. Little empirical research has been conducted in the scientific community on identifying these impediments. Knowing these impediments is a driver for change in the solutions domain (i.e., creating improved or new methods, tools, processes, etc.) to deal with such impediments. Through a case study of an industrial RE project, we have identified a number of key impediments to achieving regulatory compliance in a large-scale, complex, systems engineering project. This project is an upgrade of a rail infrastructure system. The key contribution of the article is a number of hitherto uncovered impediments described in qualitative and quantitative terms. The article also describes an artefact model, depicting key artefacts and relationships involved in such a compliance project. This model was created from data gathered and observations made in this compliance project. In addition, the article describes emergent metrics on regulatory compliance of requirements that can possibly be used for estimating the effort needed to achieve regulatory compliance of system requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8212","fieldValue":"Impediments to Regulatory Compliance of Requirements in Contractual Systems Engineering Projects: A Case Study"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8212","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8212","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8213","fieldValue":" Requirements Engineering (RE) faces considerable challenges that are often related to boundaries between various stakeholders involved in the software development process. These challenges may be addressed by boundary spanning practices. We examine how boundary spanning can be adapted to address RE challenges in Product Family Development (PFD), a context that involves complex RE. We study two different development approaches, namely, conventional and agile PFD, because these present considerably different challenges. Our findings from a multisite case study present boundary spanning as a solution to improve the quality of RE processes and highlight interesting differences in how boundary spanner roles and boundary objects are adapted in conventional and agile PFD."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8213","fieldValue":"Situated Boundary Spanning: An Empirical Investigation of Requirements Engineering Practices in Product Family Development"}
