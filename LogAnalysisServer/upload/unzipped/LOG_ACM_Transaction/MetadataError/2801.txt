Scheifeleâ\u20AC™s algorithm is one of the excellent integrators developed in the past years to take advantage of special transformations of variables such as the K-S set. It is based on using expansions in series of the so-called G-functions, and generalizes the Taylor series integrators but with the remarkable property of integrating without truncation error oscillations in one basic known frequency. A generalization of Scheifeleâ\u20AC™s method capable of integrating exactly harmonic oscillations in two known frequencies is developed here, after introducing a two parametric family of analytical &phiv;-functions. Moreover, the local error contains the perturbation parameter as a factor when the algorithm is applied to perturbed problems. The good behavior and the long-term accuracy of the new method are shown through several examples, including systems with low- and high-frequency constituents and a perturbed satellite orbit. The new methods provide significantly higher accuracy and efficiency than a selection of well-reputed general-purpose integrators and even recent symplectic or symmetric integrators, whose good behavior in the long-term integration of the Kepler problem and the other oscillatory systems is well stated in recent literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19255","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19255","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2863","fieldValue":" For the generation of highly natural synthetic speech, the control of prosody is of primary importance. The fundamental frequency (F0) is one of the most important components of speech prosody. This research investigates the variation of F0 in continuous Cantonese speech, with the goal of establishing an effective mechanism of prosody control in Cantonese text-to-speech (TTS) applications. Cantonese is a commonly used Chinese dialect that is well known for being rich in tones. This article describes a simple yet effective approach to the analysis and modeling of F0. The surface F0 contour of a continuous Cantonese utterance is considered to be the combination of a global component--phrase-level intonation curve, and local components--syllable-level tone contoursA novel method of F0 normalization is proposed to separate the local components from the global one. As a result, the variation in tone contours is greatly reduced. Statistical analysis is performed for the phrase curves and context-dependent tone contours that are extracted from a large corpus of 1,200 utterances. Specifically, the analysis is focused on co-articulated tone contours for disyllabic words, cross-word contours, and phrase-initial tone contours. Based on the results of the analysis, a template-based model for F0 generation is established and integrated with a Cantonese TTS system. Subjective listening tests show that the proposed model significantly improves the naturalness of the output speech."}
