If the same primer is to amplify multiple closely related target sequences, then it is necessary to make the primers \"degenerate\", which would allow it to hybridize to target sequences with a limited amount of variability that may have been caused by mutations. However, the PCR technique can only allow a limited amount of degeneracy, and therefore the design of degenerate primers requires the identification of reasonably well-conserved regions in the input sequences. We take an existing algorithm for designing degenerate primers that is based on clustering and parallelize it in a web-accessible software package GPUDePiCt, using a shared memory model and the computing power of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). We test our implementation on large sets of aligned sequences from the human genome and show a multi-fold speedup for clustering using our hybrid GPU\/CPU implementation over a pure CPU approach for these sequences, which consist of more than 7,500 nucleotides. We also demonstrate that this speedup is consistent over larger numbers and longer lengths of aligned sequences."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5172","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5172","fieldValue":"GPUDePiCt: a parallel implementation of a clustering algorithm for computing degenerate primers on graphics processing units"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5173","fieldValue":" Systematic identification of protein complexes from protein-protein interaction networks (PPIs) is an important application of data mining in life science. Over the past decades, various new clustering techniques have been developed based on modelling PPIs as binary relations. Non-binary information of co-complex relations (prey\/bait) in PPIs data derived from tandem affinity purification\/mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) experiments has been unfairly disregarded. In this paper, we propose a Biased Random Walk based algorithm for detecting protein complexes from TAP-MS data, resulting in the random walk with restarting baits (RWRB). RWRB is developed based on Random walk with restart. The main contribution of RWRB is the incorporation of co-complex relations in TAP-MS PPI networks into the clustering process, by implementing a new restarting strategy during the process of random walk. Through experimentation on un-weighted and weighted TAP-MS data sets, we validated biological significance of our results by mapping them to manually curated complexes. Results showed that, by incorporating non-binary, co-membership information, significant improvement has been achieved in terms of both statistical measurements and biological relevance. Better accuracy demonstrates that the proposed method outperformed several state-of-the-art clustering algorithms for the detection of protein complexes in TAP-MS data."}
