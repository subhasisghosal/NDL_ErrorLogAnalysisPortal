However, only a few efforts have been made so far to design password-authenticated group key exchange (GPAKE) protocols. In a 2PAKE or GPAKE protocol, it is assumed that short passwords are preshared among users. This assumption, however, would be impractical in certain applications. Motivated by this observation, this article presents a GPAKE protocol without the password sharing assumption. To obtain the passwords, wireless devices, such as smart phones, tablets, and laptops, are used to extract short secrets at the physical layer. Using the extracted secrets, users in our protocol can establish a group key at higher layers with light computation consumptions. Thus, our GPAKE protocol is a cross-layer design. Additionally, our protocol is a compiler, that is, our protocol can transform any provably secure 2PAKE protocol into a GPAKE protocol with only one more round of communications. Besides, the proposed protocol is proved secure in the standard model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24535","fieldValue":" The Evolved Packet System-based Authentication and Key Agreement (EPS-AKA) protocol of the long-term evolution (LTE) network does not support Internet of Things (IoT) objects and has several security limitations, including transmission of the objectâ\u20AC™s (user\/device) identity and key set identifier in plaintext over the network, synchronization, large overhead, limited identity privacy, and security attack vulnerabilities. In this article, we propose a new secure and efficient AKA protocol for the LTE network that supports secure and efficient communications among various IoT devices as well as among the users. Analysis shows that our protocol is secure, efficient, and privacy preserved, and reduces bandwidth consumption during authentication."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24535","fieldValue":"LTE"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24536","fieldValue":" Analyzing the security of Wearable Internet-of-Things (WIoT) devices is considered a complex task due to their heterogeneous nature. In addition, there is currently no mechanism that performs security testing for WIoT devices in different contexts. In this article, we propose an innovative security testbed framework targeted at wearable devices, where a set of security tests are conducted, and a dynamic analysis is performed by realistically simulating environmental conditions in which WIoT devices operate. The architectural design of the proposed testbed and a proof-of-concept, demonstrating a preliminary analysis and the detection of context-based attacks executed by smartwatch devices, are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24536","fieldValue":"ACM"}
