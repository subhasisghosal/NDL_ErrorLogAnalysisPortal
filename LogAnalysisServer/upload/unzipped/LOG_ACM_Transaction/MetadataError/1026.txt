In this paper we present a theory of fragmentation with overlapping fragments to study the complexity of the problems involved in checking the completeness of a fragmentation schema and in querying and updating a fragmented relation. We analyze these problems from the complexity viewpoint and present sound and complete algorithms for their solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14128","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14128","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14129","fieldValue":" The conventional models of authorization have been designed for database systems supporting the hierarchical, network, and relational models of data. However, these models are not adequate for next-generation database systems that support richer data models that include object-oriented concepts and semantic data modeling concepts. Rabitti, Woelk, and Kim [14] presented a preliminary model of authorization for use as the basis of an authorization mechanism in such database systems. In this paper we present a fuller model of authorization that fills a few major gaps that the conventional models of authorization cannot fill for next-generation database systems. We also further formalize the notion of implicit authorization and refine the application of the notion of implicit authorization to object-oriented and semantic modeling concepts. We also describe a user interface for using the model of authorization and consider key issues in implementing the authorization model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14129","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14129","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14130","fieldValue":" One of the demands of database system transaction management is to achieve a high degree of concurrency by taking into consideration the semantics of high-level operations. On the other hand, the implementation of such operations must pay attention to conflicts on the storage representation levels below. To meet these requirements in a layered architecture, we propose a multilevel transaction management utilizing layer-specific semantics. Based on the theoretical notion of multilevel serializability, a family of concurrency control strategies is developed. Suitable recovery protocols are investigated for aborting single transactions and for restarting the system after a crash. The choice of levels involved in a multilevel transaction strategy reveals an inherent trade-off between increased concurrency and growing recovery costs. A series of measurements has been performed in order to compare several strategies. Preliminary results indicate considerable performance gains of the multilevel transaction approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14130","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14130","fieldValue":"ACM"}
