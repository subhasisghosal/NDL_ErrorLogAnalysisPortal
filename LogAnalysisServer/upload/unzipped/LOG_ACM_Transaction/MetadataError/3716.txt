A significant portion of that design task is the creation of the interconnect pathways between functional structures. We present a synthesis tool that automates this process and focuses on the interconnect needs in the fine-grained (sub-IP-block) design space. Here there are several issues that prior research and tools do not address well: the need to have fixed, deterministic latency between communicating units (to enable high-performance local communication without the area overheads of latency insensitivity), and the ability to avoid generating unnecessary arbitration hardware when the application design can avoid it. Using a design example, our tool generates interconnect that requires 69&percnt; fewer lines of specification code than a handwritten Verilog implementation, which is a 32&percnt; overall reduction for the entire application. The resulting system, while requiring 6&percnt; more total functional and interconnect area, achieves the same performance. We also show a quantitative and qualitative advantages against an existing commercial interconnect synthesis tool, over which we achieve a 25&percnt; performance advantage and 15&percnt;\/57&percnt; logic\/memory area savings."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21951","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21952","fieldValue":"Gordon-Ross, Ann"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21952","fieldValue":" On-board processing systems are often deployed in harsh aerospace environments and must therefore adhere to stringent constraints such as low power, small size, and high dependability in the presence of faults. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are often an attractive option for designers seeking low-power, high-performance devices. However, unlike nonreconfigurable devices, radiation effects can alter an FPGAâ\u20AC™s functionality instead of just the deviceâ\u20AC™s data, requiring designers to consider fault-tolerant strategies to mitigate these effects. In this article, we present a framework to ease these system design challenges and aid designers in considering a broad range of devices and fault-tolerant strategies for on-board processing, highlighting the most promising options and tradeoffs early in the design process. This article focuses on the power, dependability, and lifetime evaluation metrics, which our framework calculates and leverages to evaluate the effectiveness of varying system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Finally, we use our framework to evaluate SoC designs for a case study on a hyperspectral-imaging (HSI) mission to demonstrate our frameworkâ\u20AC™s ability to identify efficient and effective SoC designs."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21952","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21952","fieldValue":"ACM"}
