Since the attentional relationship between visual entities conveys rich information, automatically determining the relationship provides us a semantic representation of images. We show that, by jointly clustering human gaze and visual entities, it is possible to build meaningful and comprehensive metadata that offer an interpretation about how people see images. To achieve this, we developed a clustering method that uses a joint graph structure between fixation points and over-segmented image regions to ensure a cross-domain smoothness constraint. We show that the proposed clustering method achieves better performance in relating attention to visual entities in comparison with standard clustering techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/3447","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2465780.2465784\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3447","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3447","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25336","fieldValue":"Yiu, Wai-Pun Ken"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25336","fieldValue":"Chan, Shueng-Han Gary"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25336","fieldValue":" Application layer multicast (ALM) has been proposed to overcome current limitations in IP multicast for large-group multimedia communication. We address offering data confidentiality tailored for ALM. To achieve confidentiality, a node may need to continuously re-encrypt packets before forwarding them downstream. Furthermore, keys have to be changed whenever there is a membership change, leading to rekey processing overhead at the nodes. For a large and dynamic group, these reencryption and rekeying operations incur high processing overhead at the nodes. We propose and analyze a scalable scheme called Secure Overlay Multicast (SOM) which clusters ALM peers so as to localize rekeying within a cluster and to limit re-encryption at cluster boundaries, thereby minimizing the total nodal processing overhead. We describe the operations of SOM and compare its nodal processing overhead with two other basic approaches, namely, host-to-host encryption and whole group encryption. We also present a simplified analytic model for SOM and show that there exists an optimal cluster size to minimize the total nodal processing overhead. By comparing with a recently proposed ALM scheme (DT protocol), SOM achieves a substantial reduction in nodal processing overhead with similar network performance in terms of network stress and delay."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25337","fieldValue":" To examine the feasibility of estimating the degree of strength of belief (SOB) of responses using eye movements, the scan paths of eye movements were analyzed while subjects reviewed their own responses to multiple choice tasks. All fixation points of eye movements were classified into visual areas, or cells, which corresponded with the positions of answers. Two estimation procedures are proposed using eye-movement data. The first one is identifying SOB using scan-path transitions. By comparing subject's reports of high and low SOB and eye-movement estimations, a significant correct rate of discrimination of SOB was observed. When the threshold of discrimination was controlled, a high rate of correct responses was obtained if it was set at a low level. The second procedure is conducting SOB discrimination using support vector machines (SVM) trained with features of fixations. Subject's gazing features were analyzed while they reviewed their own responses. A discrimination model for SOB was trained with several combinations of features to see whether performance of a significant level could be obtained. As a result, a trained model with 3 features (which consist of interval time, vertical difference, and length between fixations) can provide significant discrimination performance for SOB. These results provide evidence that strength of belief can be estimated using eye movements"}
