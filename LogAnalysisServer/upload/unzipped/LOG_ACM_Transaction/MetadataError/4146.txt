Several aspects of motion-field perception are considered, including sensitivity to spatial gradients, number of motion layers, and motion blur. Our analysis concentrates on a specific popular method for 2D flow visualization, namely, line integral convolution (LIC). Using 2D spectral analysis, we examine a tradeoff that arises in dynamic LIC between the static motion blur cue, which indicates motion direction and the dynamic cue which indicates image speed. We also present a 2D spectral synthesis method for motion-field visualization, along with several examples. The synthesis method is simple to implement and to analyze in the frequency domain, which makes it a convenient tool for studying the perception of complex motion fields."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3277","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3277","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23341","fieldValue":" Social tagging systems have established themselves as an important part in todayâ\u20AC™s Web and have attracted the interest of our research community in a variety of investigations. Henceforth, several aspects of social tagging systems have been discussed and assumptions have emerged on which our community builds their work. Yet, testing such assumptions has been difficult due to the absence of suitable usage data in the past. In this work, we thoroughly investigate and evaluate four aspects about tagging systems, covering social interaction, retrieval of posted resources, the importance of the three different types of entities, users, resources, and tags, as well as connections between these entitiesâ\u20AC™ popularity in posted and in requested content. For that purpose, we examine live server log data gathered from the real-world, public social tagging system BibSonomy. Our empirical results paint a mixed picture about the four aspects. Although typical assumptions hold to a certain extent for some, other aspects need to be reflected in a very critical light. Our observations have implications for the understanding of social tagging systems and the way they are used on the Web. We make the dataset used in this work available to other researchers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23341","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23341","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23342","fieldValue":" It has been shown that top-k retrieval quality can be considerably improved by taking not only relevance but also diversity into account. However, currently proposed diversification approaches have not put much attention on practical usability in large-scale settings, such as modern web search systems. In this work, we make two contributions toward this goal. First, we propose a combination of optimizations and heuristics for an implicit diversification algorithm based on the desirable facility placement principle, and present two algorithms that achieve linear complexity without compromising the retrieval effectiveness. Instead of an exhaustive comparison of documents, these algorithms first perform a clustering phase and then exploit its outcome to compose the diverse result set. Second, we describe and analyze two variants for distributed diversification in a computing cluster, for large-scale IR where the document collection is too large to keep in one node. Our contribution in this direction is pioneering, as there exists no earlier work in the literature that investigates the effectiveness and efficiency of diversification on a distributed setup. Extensive evaluations on a standard TREC framework demonstrate a competitive retrieval quality of the proposed optimizations to the baseline algorithm while reducing the processing time by more than 80&percnt; and up to 97&percnt;, and shed light on the efficiency and effectiveness tradeoffs of diversification when applied on top of a distributed architecture."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23342","fieldValue":"ACM"}
