As a result, hybrid-mapping FTL has become the most commonly used scheme in SSDs. But the hybrid-mapping FTL incurs a large number of costly full-merge operations. Thus, a critical challenge to hybrid-mapping FTL is how to reduce the cost of full-merge operations and improve partial merge operations and switch operations. In this article, we propose a novel FTL scheme, called Virtual Block-based Parallel FAST (VBP-FAST), that divides flash area into Virtual Blocks (VBlocks) and Physical Blocks (PBlocks) where VBlocks are used to fully exploit channel-level, die-level, and plane-level parallelism of flash. Leveraging these three levels of parallelism, the cost of full merge in VBP-FAST is significantly reduced from that of FAST. In the meantime, VBP-FAST uses PBlocks to retain the advantages of partial merge and switch operations. Our extensive trace-driven simulation results show that VBP-FAST speeds up FAST by a factor of 5.3--8.4 for random workloads and of 1.7 for sequential workloads with channel-level, die-level, and plane-level parallelism of 8, 2, and 2 (i.e., eight channels, two dies, and two planes)."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1949","fieldValue":"FTL"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1949","fieldValue":"SSD"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1949","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1949","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10429","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present a new approach to optimization of multicast in multihop cellular networks. We apply a hexagonal tessellation for inner partitioning of the cell into smaller subcells of radius r. Subcells may be several orders of magnitude smaller than, e.g., microcells, resulting in what we refer to as a nanoscale network model (NSNM), including a special nanoscale channel model (NSCM) for this application. For such tessellation, a spatial interleaving SI MAC protocol is introduced for context-aware interlink interference management. The directed flooding routing protocol (DFRP) and interflooding network coding (IFNC) are proposed for such a network model including intercell flooding coordination (ICFC) protocol to minimize the intercell interference. By adjusting the radius of the subcell, r, we obtain different hopping ranges that directly affect the throughput, power consumption, and interference. With r as the optimization parameter, in this paper we jointly optimize scheduling, routing, and power control to obtain the optimum tradeoff between throughput, delay, and power consumption in multicast cellular networks. A set of numerical results demonstrates that the NSNM enables high-resolution optimization of the systemand an effective use of the context awareness."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10429","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10429","fieldValue":"ACM"}
