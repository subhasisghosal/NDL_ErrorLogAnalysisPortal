The proof bounds the degree of the polynomials by a tower of exponentials whose height is the nesting depth of parity quantifiers in the formula. We show that this tower-type dependence is necessary. We build a family of formulas of depth q whose approximating polynomials must have degree bounded from below by a tower of exponentials of height proportional to q. Our proof has two main parts. First, we adapt and extend the results by Kolaitis and Kopparty that describe the joint distribution of the parities of the numbers of copies of small subgraphs in a random graph to the setting of graphs of growing size. Second, we analyze a variant of Karp's graph canonical labeling algorithm and exploit its massive parallelism to get a formula of low depth that defines an almost canonical pre-order on a random graph."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11695","fieldValue":" This article presents a tableau approach for deciding expressive description logics with full role negation and role identity. We consider the description logic $ALBO^id, which is ALC extended with the Boolean role operators, inverse of roles, the identity role, and includes full support for individuals and singleton concepts. ALBOid is expressively equivalent to the two-variable fragment of first-order logic with equality and subsumes Boolean modal logic. In this article, we define a sound, complete, and terminating tableau calculus for ALBOid that provides the basis for decision procedures for this logic and all its sublogics. An important novelty of our approach is the use of a generic unrestricted blocking mechanism. Unrestricted blocking is based on equality reasoning and a conceptually simple rule, which performs case distinctions over the identity of individuals. The blocking mechanism ties the proof of termination of tableau derivations to the finite model property of ALBOid$."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11696","fieldValue":" Data trees are trees in which each node, besides carrying a label from a finite alphabet, also carries a data value from an infinite domain. They have been used as an abstraction model for reasoning tasks on XML and verification. However, most existing approaches consider the case where only equality test can be performed on the data values. In this article we study data trees in which the data values come from a linearly ordered domain, and in addition to equality test, we can test whether the data value in a node is greater than the one in another node. We introduce an automata model for them which we call ordered-data tree automata (ODTA), provide its logical characterisation, and prove that its non-emptiness problem is decidable in 3-NExpTime. We also show that the two-variable logic on unranked data trees, studied by Bojanczyk et al. [2009], corresponds precisely to a special subclass of this automata model. Then we define a slightly weaker version of ODTA, which we call weak ODTA, and provide its logical characterisation. The complexity of the non-emptiness problem drops to NP. However, a number of existing formalisms and models studied in the literature can be captured already by weak ODTA. We also show that the definition of ODTA can be easily modified, to the case where the data values come from a tree-like partially ordered domain, such as strings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11696","fieldValue":"ACM"}
