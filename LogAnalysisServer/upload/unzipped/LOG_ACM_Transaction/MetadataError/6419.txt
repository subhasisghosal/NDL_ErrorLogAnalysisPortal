Cache partitioning can be used to reduce or eliminate CRPD. We propose integration of cache partitioning and Preemption Threshold Scheduling to optimize schedulability for both Fixed-Priority and Earliest Deadline First scheduling algorithms on a uniprocessor. We let each subset of tasks assigned the same cache partition be a nonpreemptive group by assigning the same preemption threshold to them, which eliminates CRPD both within each cache partition and between different cache partitions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7060","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7060","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7061","fieldValue":" Due to the efficient resource usage of integrating tasks with different criticality onto a shared platform, the integration with mixed-criticality tasks is becoming an increasingly important trend in the design of real-time systems. One challenge in such a mixed-criticality system is to maximize the service for low-critical tasks, while meeting the timing constraints of high-critical tasks. In this article, we investigate how to adaptively manage the low-critical workload during runtime to meet both goals, that is, providing the service for low-critical tasks as much as possible and guaranteeing the hard real-time requirements for high-critical tasks. Unlike previous methods, which enforce an offline bound towards the low-critical workload, runtime adaptation approaches are proposed in which the incoming workload of low-critical tasks is adaptively regulated by considering the actual demand of high-critical tasks. This actual demand of the high-critical tasks, in turn, is adaptively updated using their historical arrival information. Based on this adaptation scheme, two scheduling policiesâ\u20AC\u201Dthe priority-adjustment policy and the workload-shaping policyâ\u20AC\u201Dare proposed to do the workload management. In order to reduce online management overhead, a lightweight scheme with O(n Â· log(n)) complexity is developed. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed workload management approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/7061","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Northeastern University, Shenyang, China (Chen, Gang); Technische Universit&#228;t M&#252;nchen, Garching, Germany (Hu, Biao; Cheng, Long; Knoll, Alois); Sun Yat-Sen University and Technische Universit&#228;t M&#252;nchen, Garching, Germany (Huang, Kai)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7062","fieldValue":"Lee, Yann-Hang"}
