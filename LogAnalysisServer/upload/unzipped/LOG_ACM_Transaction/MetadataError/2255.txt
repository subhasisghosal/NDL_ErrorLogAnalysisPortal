{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2654","fieldValue":" We introduce a network creation game in which each player (vertex) has a fixed budget to establish links to other players. In this model, each link has a unit price, and each agent tries to minimize its cost, which is either its eccentricity or its total distance to other players in the underlying (undirected) graph of the created network. Two versions of the game are studied: In the MAX version, the cost incurred to a vertex is the maximum distance between the vertex and other vertices, and, in the SUM version, the cost incurred to a vertex is the sum of distances between the vertex and other vertices. We prove that in both versions pure Nash equilibria exist, but the problem of finding the best response of a vertex is NP-hard. We take the social cost of the created network to be its diameter, and next we study the maximum possible diameter of an equilibrium graph with n vertices in various cases. When the sum of playersâ\u20AC™ budgets is n âˆ\u2019 1, the equilibrium graphs are always trees, and we prove that their maximum diameter is Î˜(n) and Î˜(logâ\u20AC\u2030n) in MAX and SUM versions, respectively. When each vertex has a unit budget (i.e., can establish a link to just one vertex), the diameter of any equilibrium graph in either version is Î˜(1). We give examples of equilibrium graphs in the MAX version, such that all vertices have positive budgets and yet the diameter is Î©(&surd;logn). This interesting (and perhaps counterintuitive) result shows that increasing the budgets may increase the diameter of equilibrium graphs and hence deteriorate the network structure. Then we prove that every equilibrium graph in the SUM version has diameter $2^O(&surd;logn)$. Finally, we show that if the budget of each player is at least k, then every equilibrium graph in the SUM version is k-connected or has a diameter smaller than 4."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2654","fieldValue":"Braess&rsquo;s paradox"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2654","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2654","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17486","fieldValue":"Cheng, Ming-Ming"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17486","fieldValue":" We present a new interactive and online approach to 3D scene understanding. Our system, SemanticPaint, allows users to simultaneously scan their environment whilst interactively segmenting the scene simply by reaching out and touching any desired object or surface. Our system continuously learns from these segmentations, and labels new unseen parts of the environment. Unlike offline systems where capture, labeling, and batch learning often take hours or even days to perform, our approach is fully online. This provides users with continuous live feedback of the recognition during capture, allowing to immediately correct errors in the segmentation and\/or learningâ\u20AC\u201Da feature that has so far been unavailable to batch and offline methods. This leads to models that are tailored or personalized specifically to the user's environments and object classes of interest, opening up the potential for new applications in augmented reality, interior design, and human\/robot navigation. It also provides the ability to capture substantial labeled 3D datasets for training large-scale visual recognition systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17486","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17486","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17487","fieldValue":"Cani, Marie-Paule"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17487","fieldValue":" We present the first sketch-based modeling method for developable surfaces with pre-designed folds, such as garments or leather products. The main challenge we address for building folded surfaces from sketches is that silhouette strokes on the sketch correspond to discontinuous sets of non-planar curves on the 3D model. We introduce a new zippering algorithm for progressively identifying silhouette edges on the model and tying them to silhouette strokes. Our solution ensures that the strokes are fully covered and optimally sampled by the model. This new method, interleaved with developability optimization steps, is implemented in a multiview sketching system where the user can sketch the contours of internal folds in addition to the usual silhouettes, borders, and seam lines. All strokes are interpreted as hard constraints, while developability is only optimized. The developability error map we provide then enables users to add local seams or darts where needed and progressively improve their design. This makes our method robust, even to coarse input for which no fully developable solution exists."}
