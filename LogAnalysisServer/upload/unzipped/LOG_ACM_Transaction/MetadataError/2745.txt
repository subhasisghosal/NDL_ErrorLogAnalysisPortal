Starting from the algorithms introduced by Liu, we propose new schedules to allocate and process tasks that improve memory usage. This generalizes two existing factorization and memory-allocation schedules by allowing a more flexible task allocation together with a specific tree traversal. We present optimal algorithms for this new class of schedules, and demonstrate experimentally their benefit for some real-world matrices from sparse matrix collections where either the active memory or the total memory is minimized."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19123","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19123","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19124","fieldValue":" This article presents the design and implementation of a software tool, PROXIMUS, for error-bounded approximation of high-dimensional binary attributed datasets based on nonorthogonal decomposition of binary matrices. This tool can be used for analyzing data arising in a variety of domains ranging from commercial to scientific applications. Using a combination of innovative algorithms, novel data structures, and efficient implementation, PROXIMUS demonstrates excellent accuracy, performance, and scalability to large datasets. We experimentally demonstrate these on diverse applications in association rule mining and DNA microarray analysis. In limited beta release, PROXIMUS currently has over 300 installations in over 10 countries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19124","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19124","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2851","fieldValue":" This paper describes the rapid adaptation for surprise languages of a flexible and robust Information Extraction system based on GATE, a portable Natural Language Processing infrastructure. Our experiences show that even without a native speaker and in the absence of training data, we can quickly customize the system to a new language.
