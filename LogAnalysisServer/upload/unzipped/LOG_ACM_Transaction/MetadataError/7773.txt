It is important for root-cause analysis, network forensics, attack mitigation, and anomaly modeling. In this paper, we use meta-data provided by several histogram-based detectors to identify suspicious flows, and then apply association rule mining to find and summarize anomalous flows. Using rich traffic data from a backbone network, we show that our technique effectively finds the flows associated with the anomalous event(s) in all studied cases. In addition, it triggers a very small number of false positives, on average between 2 and 8.5, which exhibit specific patterns and can be trivially sorted out by an administrator. Our anomaly extraction method significantly reduces the work-hours needed for analyzing alarms, making anomaly detection systems more practical."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10360","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10360","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10360","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10361","fieldValue":" We study the multisource video on-demand (VoD) application in multichannel multiradio wireless mesh networks. When a user initiates a new video request, the application can stream the video not only from the media servers, but also from the peers that have buffered the video. The multipath multisource video on-demand streaming has been applied in wired networks with great success. However, it remains a challenging task in wireless networks due to wireless interference. In this paper, we first focus on the problem of finding the maximum number of high-quality and independent paths from the user to the servers or peers for each VoD request by considering the effect of wireless interference. We formulate it as a constrained maximum independent paths problem and propose two efficient heuristic path discovery algorithms. Based on the multiple paths discovered, we further propose a joint routing and rate allocation algorithm, which minimizes the network congestion caused by the new VoD session. The algorithm is aware of the optimization for both existing and potential VoD sessions in the wireless mesh network. We evaluate our algorithms with real video traces. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm not only improves the average video streaming performance over all the coexisting VoD sessions in the network, but also increases the network's capacity of satisfying more subsequent VoD requests."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10361","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10361","fieldValue":"ACM"}
