Today, many of these applications have to handle an increasing number of participants and deal with the difficult problem of scalability. We propose an approach at the transport layer, using multiple multicast groups and multiple agents. This approach involves the dynamic partitioning of the virtual environment into spatial areas and the association of these areas with multicast groups. It uses a method based on the theory of planar point processes to determine an appropriate cell size, so that the incoming traffic at the receiver side remains with a given probability below a sufficiently low threshold. We evaluate the performance of our scheme and show that it allows to significantly improve the participants' satisfaction while adding very low overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9296","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9296","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9296","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9297","fieldValue":" This paper describes the design and implementation of protocol scrubbers. Protocol scrubbers are transparent, interposed mechanisms for explicitly removing network scans and attacks at various protocol layers. The transport scrubber supports downstream passive network-based intrusion detection systems by converting ambiguous network flows into well-behaved flows that are unequivocally interpreted by all downstream endpoints. The fingerprint scrubber restricts an attacker's ability to determine the operating system of a protected host. As an example, this paper presents the implementation of a TCP scrubber that eliminates insertion and evasion attacks--attacks that use ambiguities to subvert detection--on passive network-based intrusion detection systems, while preserving high performance. The TCP scrubber is based on a novel, simplified state machine that performs in a fast and scalable manner. The fingerprint scrubber is built upon the TCP scrubber and removes additional ambiguities from flows that can reveal implementation-specific details about a host's operating system."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9297","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9297","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9297","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9298","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of congestion control in networks which support both multirate multicast sessions and unicast sessions. We present a decentralized algorithm which enables the different rate-adaptive receivers in different multicast sessions to adjust their rates to satisfy some fairness criterion. A one-bit ECN marking strategy to be used at the nodes is also proposed. The congestion-control mechanism does not require any per-flow state information for unicast flows at the nodes. At junctions nodes of each multicast tree, some state information about the rates along the branches at the node may be required. The congestion-control mechanism takes into account the diverse user requirements when different receivers within a multicast session have different utility functions, but does not require the network to have any knowledge about the receiver utility functions."}
