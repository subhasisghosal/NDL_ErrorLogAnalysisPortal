{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10898","fieldValue":" Comparing with the unicast technology, multiple flows from the same source in multicast scenario can be aggregated even if their destinations are different. This paper evaluates such distinction by the multicast gain on per-node capacity and delay, which are defined as the per-node capacity and delay ratios between multi-unicast and multicast (m destinations for each multicast session). Particularly, the restricted mobility model is proposed, which is a representative mobility model characterizing a class of mobility models with different average moving speeds. The theoretical analysis of this model indicates that the mobility significantly decreases the multicast gain on per-node capacity and delay, though the per-node capacity of both unicast and multicast can be enhanced by mobility. This finding suggests that mobility weakens the distinction between multicast and unicast. Finally, a general framework of multicast study is constituted by analyzing the upper-bound (Θ(m)), the lower-bound (Θ(1)) and the main determinants of the multicast gain on both per-node capacity and delay regardless of mobility model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10898","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10898","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10898","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10898","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10899","fieldValue":"Wong, Wai-Choong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10899","fieldValue":" We contend that context information of Internet clients can help to efficiently manage a variety of underlying resources for different Internet services and systems. We therefore propose a resource distribution framework that provides quality of experience (QoE) aware service differentiation, which means that starving clients are prioritized in resource allocation to enhance the corresponding end-user's QoE. The framework also actively motivates each Internet client to consistently provide its actual context information and to adopt moderate competition policies, given that all clients are selfish but rational in nature. We analyze the Internet client's behavior by formulating a non-cooperative game and prove that the framework guides all clients (game players) towards a unique Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we prove that the distribution results computed by the framework maximize a social welfare function. Throughout this paper, we demonstrate the motivation, operation and performance of the framework by presenting a Web system example, which leverages on the advanced context information deduced by a context-aware system."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10899","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10899","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10899","fieldValue":"ACM"}
