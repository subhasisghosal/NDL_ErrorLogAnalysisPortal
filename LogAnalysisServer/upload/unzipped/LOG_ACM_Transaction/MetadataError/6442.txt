RSs play an important persuasion role, as they can potentially augment the usersâ\u20AC™ trust towards in an application and orient their decisions or actions towards specific directions. This article explores the persuasiveness of RSs, presenting two vast empirical studies that address a number of research questions. First, we investigate if a design property of RSs, defined by the statistically measured quality of algorithms, is a reliable predictor of their potential for persuasion. This factor is measured in terms of perceived quality, defined by the overall satisfaction, as well as by how users judge the accuracy and novelty of recommendations. For our purposes, we designed an empirical study involving 210 subjects and implemented seven full-sized versions of a commercial RS, each one using the same interface and dataset (a subset of Netflix), but each with a different recommender algorithm. In each experimental configuration we computed the statistical quality (recall and F-measures) and collected data regarding the quality perceived by 30 users. The results show us that algorithmic attributes are less crucial than we might expect in determining the userâ\u20AC™s perception of an RSâ\u20AC™s quality, and suggest that the userâ\u20AC™s judgment and attitude towards a recommender are likely to be more affected by factors related to the user experience. Second, we explore the persuasiveness of RSs in the context of large interactive TV services. We report a study aimed at assessing whether measurable persuasion effects (e.g., changes of shopping behavior) can be achieved through the introduction of a recommender. Our data, collected for more than one year, allow us to conclude that, (1) the adoption of an RS can affect both the lift factor and the conversion rate, determining an increased volume of sales and influencing the userâ\u20AC™s decision to actually buy one of the recommended products, (2) the introduction of an RS tends to diversify purchases and orient users towards less obvious choices (the long tail), and (3) the perceived novelty of recommendations is likely to be more influential than their perceived accuracy. Overall, the results of these studies improve our understanding of the persuasion phenomena induced by RSs, and have implications that can be of interest to academic scholars, designers, and adopters of this class of systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7143","fieldValue":"ITV"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7143","fieldValue":"Investigating the Persuasion Potential of Recommender Systems from a Quality Perspective: An Empirical Study"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7143","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7143","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7144","fieldValue":"Andrews, Pierre Y"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7144","fieldValue":" The human-computer dialogue research field has been studying interaction with computers since the early stage of Artificial Intelligence, however, research has often focused on very practical tasks to be completed with the dialogues. A new trend in the field tries to implement persuasive techniques with automated interactive agents; unlike booking a train ticket, for example, such dialogues require the system to show more anthropomorphic qualities. The influences of such qualities in the effectiveness of persuasive dialogue is only starting to be studied. In this article we focus on one important perceived trait of the system: personality, and explore how it influences the persuasiveness of a dialogue system. We introduce a new persuasive dialogue system and combine it with a state of the art personality utterance generator. By doing so, we can control the systemâ\u20AC™s extraversion personality trait and observe its influence on the userâ\u20AC™s perception of the dialogue and its output. In particular, we observe that the userâ\u20AC™s extraversion influences their perception of the dialogue and its persuasiveness, and that the perceived personality of the system can affect its trustworthiness and persuasiveness. We believe that theses observations will help to set up guidelines to tailor dialogue systems to the userâ\u20AC™s interaction expectations and improve the persuasive interventions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7145","fieldValue":" This article introduces the tag genome, a data structure that extends the traditional tagging model to provide enhanced forms of user interaction. Just as a biological genome encodes an organism based on a sequence of genes, the tag genome encodes an item in an information space based on its relationship to a common set of tags. We present a machine learning approach for computing the tag genome, and we evaluate several learning models on a ground truth dataset provided by users. We describe an application of the tag genome called Movie Tuner which enables users to navigate from one item to nearby items along dimensions represented by tags. We present the results of a 7-week field trial of 2,531 users of Movie Tuner and a survey evaluating usersâ\u20AC™ subjective experience. Finally, we outline the broader space of applications of the tag genome."}
