{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10260","fieldValue":" Data center networks encode locality and topology information into their server and switch addresses for performance and routing purposes. For this reason, the traditional address configuration protocols such as DHCP require a huge amount of manual input, leaving them error-prone. In this paper, we present DAC, a generic and automatic Data center Address Configuration system. With an automatically generated blueprint that defines the connections of servers and switches labeled by logical IDs, e.g., IP addresses, DAC first learns the physical topology labeled by device IDs, e.g., MAC addresses. Then, at the core of DAC is its device-to-logical ID mapping and malfunction detection. DAC makes an innovation in abstracting the device-to-logical ID mapping to the graph isomorphism problem and solves it with low time complexity by leveraging the attributes of data center network topologies. Its malfunction detection scheme detects errors such as device and link failures and miswirings, including the most difficult case where miswirings do not cause any node degree change.We have evaluated DAC via simulation, implementation, and experiments. Our simulation results show that DAC can accurately find all the hardest-to-detect malfunctions and can autoconfigure a large data center with 3.8 million devices in 46 s. In our implementation, we successfully autoconfigure a small 64-server BCube network within 300 ms and show that DAC is a viable solution for data center autoconfiguration."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10260","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10260","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10260","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10261","fieldValue":"Uysal-Biyikoglu, Elif"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10261","fieldValue":" Information-theoretic broadcast channels (BCs) and multiple-access channels (MACs) enable a single node to transmit data simultaneously to multiple nodes, and multiple nodes to transmit data simultaneously to a single node, respectively. In this paper, we address the problem of link scheduling in multihop wireless networks containing nodes with BC and MAC capabilities. We first propose an interference model that extends protocol interference models, originally designed for point-to-point channels, to include the possibility of BCs and MACs. Due to the high complexity of optimal link schedulers, we introduce the Multiuser Greedy Maximum Weight algorithm for link scheduling in multihop wireless networks containing BCs and MACs. Given a network graph, we develop new local pooling conditions and show that the performance of our algorithm can be fully characterized using the associated parameter, the multiuser local pooling factor. We provide examples of some network graphs, on which we apply local pooling conditions and derive the multiuser local pooling factor. We prove optimality of our algorithm in tree networks and show that the exploitation of BCs and MACs improve the throughput performance considerably in multihop wireless networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10261","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10261","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10261","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10262","fieldValue":" Excess capacity (EC) is the unused capacity in a network. We propose EC management techniques to improve network performance. Our techniques exploit the EC in two ways. First, a connection preprovisioning algorithm is used to reduce the connection setup time. Second, whenever possible, we use protection schemes that have higher availability and shorter protection switching time. Specifically, depending on the amount of EC available in the network, our proposed EC management techniques dynamically migrate connections between high-availability, high-backup-capacity protection schemes and low-availability, low-backup-capacity protection schemes. Thus, multiple protection schemes can coexist in the network. The four EC management techniques studied in this paper differ in two respects: when the connections are migrated from one protection scheme to another, and which connections are migrated. Specifically, Lazy techniques migrate connections only when necessary, whereas Proactive techniques migrate connections to free up capacity in advance. Partial Backup Reprovisioning (PBR) techniques try to migrate a minimal set of connections, whereas Global Backup Reprovisioning (GBR) techniques migrate all connections. We develop integer linear program (ILP) formulations and heuristic algorithms for the EC management techniques. We then present numerical examples to illustrate how the EC management techniques improve network performance by exploiting the EC in wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks."}
