Cluster ensembles can provide robust and stable solutions by leveraging the consensus across multiple clustering results, while averaging out emergent spurious structures that arise due to the various biases to which each participating algorithm is tuned. In this article, we address the problem of combining multiple weighted clusters that belong to different subspaces of the input space. We leverage the diversity of the input clusterings in order to generate a consensus partition that is superior to the participating ones. Since we are dealing with weighted clusters, our consensus functions make use of the weight vectors associated with the clusters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by running experiments with several real datasets, including high-dimensional text data. Furthermore, we investigate in depth the issue of diversity and accuracy for our ensemble methods. Our analysis and experimental results show that the proposed techniques are capable of producing a partition that is as good as or better than the best individual clustering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7855","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7855","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7856","fieldValue":"Lakshmanan, Laks V S"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7856","fieldValue":"Tung, Anthony K H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7856","fieldValue":" Game theory is a powerful tool for analyzing the competitions among manufacturers in a market. In this article, we present a study on combining game theory and data mining by introducing the concept of domination game analysis. We present a multidimensional market model, where every dimension represents one attribute of a commodity. Every product or customer is represented by a point in the multidimensional space, and a product is said to â\u20ACœdominateâ\u20AC? a customer if all of its attributes can satisfy the requirements of the customer. The expected market share of a product is measured by the expected number of the buyers in the customers, all of which are equally likely to buy any product dominating him. A Nash equilibrium is a configuration of the products achieving stable expected market shares for all products. We prove that Nash equilibrium in such a model can be computed in polynomial time if every manufacturer tries to modify its product in a round robin manner. To further improve the efficiency of the computation, we also design two algorithms for the manufacturers to efficiently find their best response to other products in the market."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7856","fieldValue":"ACM"}
