Blind students often rely on tactile graphics to access textbook images. Many textbook images have a large number of text labels that need to be made accessible. In order to do so, we propose TGV, which uses QR codes to replace the text, as an alternative to Braille. The codes are read with a smartphone application. We evaluated the system with a longitudinal study where 10 blind and low-vision participants completed tasks using three different modes on the smartphone application: (1) no guidance, (2) verbal guidance, and (3) finger-pointing guidance. Our results show that TGV is an effective way to access text in tactile graphics, especially for those blind users who are not fluent in Braille. We also found that preferences varied greatly across the modes, indicating that future work should support multiple modes. We expand upon the algorithms we used to implement the finger pointing, algorithms to automatically place QR codes on documents. We also discuss work we have started on creating a Google Glass version of the application."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6080","fieldValue":"Chau, Chi-Kin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6080","fieldValue":" Traditional studies of combinatorial auctions often only consider linear constraints. The rise of smart grid presents a new class of auctions, characterized by quadratic constraints. This article studies the complex-demand knapsack problem, in which the demands are complex valued and the capacity of supplies is described by the magnitude of total complex-valued demand. This naturally captures the power constraints in alternating current electric systems. In this article, we provide a more complete study and generalize the problem to the multi-minded version, beyond the previously known &frac;12-approximation algorithm for only a subclass of the problem. More precisely, we give a truthful polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the case Ï\u2020 Îµ &lsqb;0,&frac;Ï\u20AC2 âˆ\u2019 Î\u201D&rsqb; and a truthful fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS), which fully optimizes the objective function but violates the capacity constraint by at most (1 + &epsi;), for the case Ï\u2020 Îµ (&frac;Ï\u20AC2, Ï\u20AC âˆ\u2019 Î\u201D&rsqb;, where Ï\u2020 is the maximum argument of any complex-valued demand and &epsi;, Î\u201D > 0 are arbitrarily small constants. We complement these results by showing that, unless P&equals;NP, neither a PTAS for the case Ï\u2020 Îµ (&frac;Ï\u20AC2, Ï\u20AC âˆ\u2019 Î\u201D&rsqb; nor any bi-criteria approximation algorithm with polynomial guarantees for the case when &phis; is arbitrarily close to Ï\u20AC (that is, when Î\u201D is arbitrarily close to 0) can exist."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6080","fieldValue":"Truthful Mechanisms for Combinatorial Allocation of Electric Power in Alternating Current Electric Systems for Smart Grid"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6080","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6080","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6081","fieldValue":" We study strong equilibria in symmetric capacitated cost-sharing connection games. In these games, a graph with designated source s and sink t is given, and each edge is associated with some cost. Each agent chooses strategically an s-t path, knowing that the cost of each edge is shared equally between all agents using it. Two settings of cost-sharing connection games have been previously studied: (i) games where coalitions can form, and (ii) games where edges are associated with capacities; both settings are inspired by real-life scenarios. In this work we combine these scenarios and analyze strong equilibria (profiles where no coalition can deviate) in capacitated games. This combination gives rise to new phenomena that do not occur in the previous settings. Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide a topological characterization of networks that always admit a strong equilibrium. Second, we establish tight bounds on the efficiency loss that may be incurred due to strategic behavior, as quantified by the strong price of anarchy (and stability) measures. Interestingly, our results qualitatively differ from those obtained in the analysis of each scenario alone, and the combination of coalitions and capacities entails the introduction of more refined topology classes than previously studied."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6081","fieldValue":"ACM"}
