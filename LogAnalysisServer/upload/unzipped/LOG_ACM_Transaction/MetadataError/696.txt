{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13132","fieldValue":" Limited battery life imposes stringent constraints on the operation of battery-powered portable systems. During battery discharge, the battery voltage decreases, until a certain cutoff value is reached, marking the end of battery life. The amount of discharge capacity and energy delivered by the battery during its life depends not only on the battery characteristics, but also on the load conditions. A different system design may result in a different battery current (load) profile over time, leading to a different battery voltage profile over time. This article presents an analytical model that relates the battery voltage to the battery current, thus facilitating system design optimizations with respect to the battery performance. It captures well-known nonlinear phenomena of capacity loss at high discharge rates, charge recovery, and capacity fading. The proposed model has been validated against measurements taken on Li-ion batteries. We also describe techniques for efficient calculations of model's estimates, which lets a user exploit accuracy-complexity tradeoffs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13133","fieldValue":" The circuit represented by a VLSI layout must be verified by checking it against the schematic circuit as an important part of the functional verification step. This involves two central problems of matching the circuit graphs with each other (graph isomorphism) and extracting a higher level of circuit from a given level by finding subcircuits in the circuit graph (subgraph isomorphism). Modern day VLSI layouts contain millions of devices. Hence the memory requirements of the data structures required by tools for verifying them become huge and can easily exceed the amount of internal memory available on a computer. In such a scenario, a program not aware of the memory hierarchy performs badly because of its unorganized input\/output operations (I\/Os) as the speed of a disk access is about a million times slower than accessing a main memory location. In this article, we present I\/O-efficient algorithms for the graph isomorphism and subgraph isomorphism problems in the context of verification of VLSI layouts. Experimental results show the need and utility of I\/O-efficient algorithms for handling problems with large memory requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13133","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13133","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13134","fieldValue":"Chen, Po-Yuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13134","fieldValue":"Ho, Kuan-Hsien"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13134","fieldValue":" In modern sequential VLSI designs, clock tree plays an important role in synchronizing different components in a chip. To reduce peak current and power\/ground noises caused by clock network, assigning different signal polarities to clock buffers is proposed in previous work. Although peak current and power\/ground noises are minimized by signal polarities assignment, an assignment without timing information may increase the clock skew significantly. As a result, a timing-aware signal polarities assigning technique is necessary. In this article, we propose a novel signal polarities assigning technique which can not only reduce peak current and power\/ground noises simultaneously but also render the clock skew in control. The experimental result shows that the clock skew produced by our algorithm is 94&percnt; of original clock skew in average while the clock skews produced by three algorithms (Partition, MST, Matching) in the absence of post clock tuning steps in the previous work are 235&percnt;, 272&percnt;, and 283&percnt;, respectively. Moreover, our algorithm is as efficient as the three algorithms of the previous work in reducing peak current and power\/ground noises."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13134","fieldValue":"ACM"}
