An important advantage of these synthesis methods is that they obviate the need to manually compose a program and manually construct a proof of its correctness. One only has to formulate a precise problem specification; the synthesis method then mechanically constructs acorrect solution. A serious drawback of these methods in practice,however, is that they suffer from the state explosion problem. Tosynthesize a concurrent system consisting of K sequential processes, each having N states in its local transition diagram, requiresconstruction of the global product-machine having about NKglobal states in general. This exponential growth in K makes it infeasible to synthesize systems composed of more than 2 or 3processes. In this article, we show how to synthesize concurrentsystems consisting of many (i.e., a finite but arbitrarily largenumber K of) similar sequential processes. Our approach avoids construction of the global product-machine for K processes; instead, it constructs a two-process product-machine for a single pair of generic sequential processes. The method is uniform in K, providing a simple template that can be instantiated for each process to yield a solution for any fixed K. The method is also illustrated on synchronization problems from the literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20363","fieldValue":" The efficiency of dynamic dispatch is a major impediment to theadoption of multimethods in object-oriented languages. In thisarticle, we propose a simple multimethod dispatch scheme based oncompressed dispatch tables. This scheme is applicable to anyobject-oriented language using a method precedence order thatsatisfies a specific monotonous property (e.g., as Cecil and Dylan)and guarantees that dynamic dispatch is performed in constant time,the latter being a major requirement for some languages andapplications. We provide efficient algorithms to build the dispatchtables, provide their worst-case complexity, and demonstrate theeffectiveness of our scheme by real measurements performed on twolarge object-oriented applications. Finally, we provide a detailedcomparison of our technique with other existing techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20363","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20363","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2947","fieldValue":" This article presents a new hypothesis alignment method for combining outputs of multiple machine translation (MT) systems. An indirect hidden Markov model (IHMM) is proposed to address the synonym matching and word ordering issues in hypothesis alignment. Unlike traditional HMMs whose parameters are trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the parameters of the IHMM are estimated indirectly from a variety of sources including word semantic similarity, word surface similarity, and a distance-based distortion penalty. The IHMM-based method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, TER-based alignment model in our experiments on NIST benchmark datasets. Our combined SMT system using the proposed method achieved the best Chinese-to-English translation result in the constrained training track of the 2008 NIST Open MT Evaluation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2947","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2947","fieldValue":"ACM"}
