The contributions of this paper are twofold. We first offer a uniform logical setting which allows us to encompass and to relate the existing work on answering and rewriting queries using views. In particular, we make clearer the connection between the problem of rewriting queries using views and the problem of answering queries using extensions of views. Then we focus on an instance of the problem of rewriting conjunctive queries using views through an ontology expressed in a description logic, for which we exhibit a complete algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24291","fieldValue":" Internet-based e-services require application developers to deal explicitly with failures of the underlying software components, for example web servers, servlets, browser sessions, and so forth. This complicates application programming, and may expose failures to end users. This paper presents a framework for an application-independent infrastructure that provides recovery guarantees and masks almost all system failures, thus relieving the application programmer from having to deal with these failures---by making applications \"stateless.\" The main concept is an interaction contract between two components regarding message and state preservation. The framework provides comprehensive recovery encompassing data, messages, and the states of application components. We describe techniques to reduce logging cost, allow effective log truncation, and permit independent recovery for critical components. We illustrate the framework's utility via web-based e-services scenarios. Its feasibility is demonstrated by our prototype implementation of interaction contracts based on the Apache web server and the PHP servlet engine. Finally, we discuss industrial relevance for middleware architectures such as.
