The main purpose of this paper is a formal presentation of the meaning of basic language constructs employed in many database languages (sublanguages). Therefore, stylized query languages SSL (Sample Selection Language) and J (Joins) are introduced, wherein most of the typical entries present in other query languages are collected. The semantics of SSL and J are defined by means of the denotational method and explained informally. In SSL and J, four types of expressions are introduced: a selector (denotes a set of addresses), a term (denotes a set of values), a formula (denotes a truth value), and a join (denotes a set of n-tuples of addresses or values). In many cases alternative semantics are given and discussed. In order to obtain more general properties of the proposed languages, a new database access model is introduced, intended to be a tool for the description of the logical access paths to data. In particular, the access paths of the network and relational models can be described. SSL and J expressions may be addressed to both data structures. In the case of the relational model, expressions of J are similar to SQL or QUEL statements. Thus J may be considered a generalization of relational query languages for the network model. Finally, a programming language, based on SSL and J, is outlined, and the issues of SSL and J implementation are considered."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2324","fieldValue":" Given a Euclidean graph G over a set P of n points in the plane, we are interested in verifying whether G is a Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) of P or G differs from it in more than &epsi; n edges.

The first step is to identify the underlying density function of the original series and to estimate the parameters of this density function. The second step is to generate a series of data from the estimated density function. And the final step is to map and replace the generated series for the original one. Because it is replaced by the distorted data set, probability distortion guards the privacy of an individual belonging to the original data set. At the same time, the probability distorted series provides asymptotically the same statistical properties as those of the original series, since both are under the same distribution. Unlike conventional point distortion, probability distortion is difficult to compromise by repeated queries, and provides a maximum exposure for statistical analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14016","fieldValue":"ACM"}
