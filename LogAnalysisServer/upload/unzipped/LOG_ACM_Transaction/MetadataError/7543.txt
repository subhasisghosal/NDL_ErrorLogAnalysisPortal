This is because it may be costly in several situations to run fiber to every home (or equivalent end-user premises) from the telecom central office (CO); also, providing wireless access from the CO to every end user may not be possible because of limited spectrum. Thus, running fiber as far as possible from the CO toward the end user and then having wireless access technologies take over may be an excellent compromise. How far should fiber penetrate before wireless takes over is an interesting engineering design and optimization problem, which we address in this paper. We propose and investigate the characteristics of an analytical model for network planning, namely optimum placements of base stations (BSs) and optical network units (ONUs) in aWOBAN (called the primal model, or PM). We develop several constraints to be satisfied: BS and ONU installation constraints, user assignment constraints, channel assignment constraints, capacity constraints, and signal-quality and interference constraints. To solve this PM with reasonable accuracy, we use \"Lagrangean relaxation\" to obtain the corresponding \"Lagrangean dual\" model. We solve this dual problem to obtain a lower bound (LB) of the primal problem. We also develop an algorithm (called the primal algorithm) to solve the PM to obtain an upper bound (UB). Via simulation, we compare this PM to a placement heuristic (called the cellular heuristic) and verify that the placement problem is quite sensitive to a set of chosen metrics."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9893","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9893","fieldValue":"Hybrid wireless-optical broadband access network (WOBAN): network planning using Lagrangean relaxation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9894","fieldValue":" Connectivity is a crucial issue in wireless ad hoc networks (WANETs). Gupta and Kumar have shown that in WANETs using omnidirectional antennas, the critical transmission range to achieve asymptotic connectivity is O(âˆšlogn\/n) if n nodes are uniformly and independently distributed in a disk of unit area. In this paper, we investigate the connectivity problem when directional antennas are used. We first assume that each node in the network randomly beamforms in one beam direction. We find that there also exists a critical transmission range for a WANET to achieve asymptotic connectivity, which corresponds to a critical transmission power (CTP). Since CTP is dependent on the directional antenna pattern, the number of beams, and the propagation environment, we then formulate a non-linear programming problem to minimize the CTP. We show that when directional antennas use the optimal antenna pattern, the CTP in a WANET using directional antennas at both transmitter and receiver is smaller than that when either transmitter or receiver uses directional antenna and is further smaller than that when only omnidirectional antennas are used. Moreover, we revisit the connectivity problem assuming that two neighboring nodes using directional antennas can be guaranteed to beamform to each other to carry out the transmission. A smaller critical transmission range than that in the previous case is found, which implies smaller CTP."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9894","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9894","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9894","fieldValue":"ACM"}
