The proposed protocols are source-routed and include the delivery tree encoded as a Bloom filter in each packet. The network nodes forward packets based on this in-packet information without consulting routing tables and without storing per-flow state. We show that these protocols have critical vulnerabilities and make several false security assumptions. In particular, we present DoS attacks against broad classes of Bloom-filter-based protocols and conclude that the protocols are not ready for deployment on open networks. The results also help us understand the limitations and design options for Bloom-filter forwarding."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10656","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10656","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10656","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10657","fieldValue":" This paper focuses on scheduling in multihop wireless networks where flows are associated with fixed routes. The well-known back-pressure scheduling algorithm is throughput-optimal, but requires constant exchange of queue length information among neighboring nodes for calculating the \"back-pressure.\" Moreover, previous research shows that the total queue length along a route increases quadratically as the route length under the backpressure algorithm, resulting in poor delay performance. In this paper, we propose a self-regulated MaxWeight scheduling, which does not require back-pressure calculation. We prove that the self-regulated MaxWeight scheduling is throughput-optimal (an algorithm is said to be throughput-optimal if it can stabilize any traffic that can be stabilized by any other algorithm). In the simulation part, we show that the self-regulated MaxWeight scheduling has a much better delay performance than the back-pressure algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10657","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10657","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10657","fieldValue":"ACM"}
