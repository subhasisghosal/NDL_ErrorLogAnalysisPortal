The articles in this special issue look at the other end of the spectrum: learning advanced subjects, here, concurrent, parallel and distributed computation. The articles present four approaches for teaching these subjects using infra-structure that is feasible for educational institutions to acquire: MapReduce in a cloud, remote computing on a multicore system, a network of gaming consoles, and software modeling using formal specification."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11155","fieldValue":"Z"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11155","fieldValue":"Z"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11155","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11155","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2018","fieldValue":" As memory systems scale, maintaining their Reliability Availability and Serviceability (RAS) is becoming more complex. To make matters worse, recent studies of DRAM failures in data centers and supercomputer environments have highlighted that large-granularity failures are common in DRAM chips. Furthermore, the move toward 3D-stacked memories can make the system vulnerable to newer failure modes, such as those occurring from faults in Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs). To architect future systems and to use emerging technology, system designers will need to employ strong error correction and repair techniques. Unfortunately, evaluating the relative effectiveness of these reliability mechanisms is often difficult and is traditionally done with analytical models, which are both error prone and time-consuming to develop. To this end, this article proposes FaultSim, a fast configurable memory-reliability simulation tool for 2D and 3D-stacked memory systems. FaultSim employs Monte Carlo simulations, which are driven by real-world failure statistics. We discuss the novel algorithms and data structures used in FaultSim to accelerate the evaluation of different resilience schemes. We implement BCH-1 (SECDED) and ChipKill codes using FaultSim and validate against an analytical model. FaultSim implements BCH-1 and ChipKill codes with a deviation of only 0.032&percnt; and 8.41&percnt; from the analytical model. FaultSim can simulate 1 million Monte Carlo trials (each for a period of 7 years) of BCH-1 and ChipKill codes in only 34 seconds and 33 seconds, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11156","fieldValue":" We describe our experiences teaching MapReduce in a large undergraduate lecture course using public cloud services and the standard Hadoop API. Using the standard API, students directly experienced the quality of industrial big-data tools. Using the cloud, every student could carry out scalability benchmarking assignments on realistic hardware, which would have been impossible otherwise. Over two semesters, over 500 students took our course. We believe this is the first large-scale demonstration that it is feasible to use pay-as-you-go billing in the cloud for a large undergraduate course. Modest instructor effort was sufficient to prevent students from overspending. Average per-pupil expenses in the Cloud were under $45. Students were excited by the assignment: 90&percnt; said they thought it should be retained in future course offerings."}
