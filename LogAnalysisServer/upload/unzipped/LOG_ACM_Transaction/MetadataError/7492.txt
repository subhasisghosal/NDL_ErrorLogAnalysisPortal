We start by applying classical results from random graph theory to show that a large variety of deterministic and random P2P graphs almost surely (i.e., with probability 1-O(1)) remain connected under random failure if and only if they have no isolated nodes. This simple, yet powerful, result subsequently allows us to derive in closed-form the probability that a P2P network develops isolated nodes, and therefore partitions, under both types of node failure. We finish the paper by demonstrating that our models match simulations very well and that dynamic P2P systems are extremely resilient under node churn as long as the neighbor replacement delay is much smaller than the average user lifetime."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9793","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9793","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9793","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8384","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9794","fieldValue":" Differentiated services can ensure that traffic on some codepoints receives higher quality of service (QoS) than traffic on other codepoints, but without additional mechanisms it cannot target any particular QoS. Congestion-based pricing has been suggested as a method to target QoS in other network architectures. Here, we investigate whether congestion-based pricing can be used to control aggregate traffic into each codepoint by motivating users to choose the codepoints appropriate for each application. We first ask what information needs to be exchanged; we assert that both price and QoS information must be available for users to make decisions. We then ask how effective congestion-based pricing in diffServ can be; we find that it is feasible only for networks with sufficiently high bandwidth to guarantee that QoS can be quickly measured."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9794","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9794","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9794","fieldValue":"ACM"}
