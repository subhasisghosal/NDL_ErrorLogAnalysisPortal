To extend the applications of regular vector-based clustering algorithms, the Discrete Distribution (D2) clustering algorithm has been developed, aiming at clustering data represented by bags of weighted vectors which are well adopted data signatures in many emerging information retrieval and multimedia learning applications. However, the high computational complexity of D2-clustering limits its impact in solving massive learning problems. Here we present the parallel D2-clustering (PD2-clustering) algorithm with substantially improved scalability. We developed a hierarchical multipass algorithm structure for parallel computing in order to achieve a balance between the individual-node computation and the integration process of the algorithm. Experiments and extensive comparisons between PD2-clustering and other clustering algorithms are conducted on synthetic datasets. The results show that the proposed parallel algorithm achieves significant speed-up with minor accuracy loss. We apply PD2-clustering to image concept learning. In addition, by extending D2-clustering to symbolic data, we apply PD2-clustering to protein sequence clustering. For both applications, we demonstrate the high competitiveness of our new algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25685","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25685","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25686","fieldValue":" Wireless communication systems are highly prone to channel errors. With video being a major player in Internet traffic and undergoing exponential growth in wireless domain, we argue for the need of a Video-aware MAC (VMAC) to significantly improve the throughput and delay performance of real-time video streaming service. VMAC makes two changes to optimize wireless LAN for video traffic: (a) It incorporates a Perceptual-Error-Tolerance (PET) to the MAC frames by reducing MAC retransmissions while minimizing any impact on perceptual video quality; and (b) It uses a group NACK-based Adaptive Window (NAW) of MAC frames to improve both throughput and delay performance in varying channel conditions. Through simulations and experiments, we observe 56--89&percnt; improvement in throughput and 34--48&percnt; improvement in delay performance over legacy DCF and 802.11e schemes. VMAC also shows 15--78&percnt; improvement over legacy schemes with multiple clients."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25686","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25686","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25687","fieldValue":" In recognition that in modern applications billions of images are stored into distributed databases in different logical or physical locations, we propose a similarity search strategy over the cloud based on the dimensions value cardinalities of image descriptors. Our strategy has low preprocessing requirements by dividing the computational cost of the preprocessing steps into several nodes over the cloud and locating the descriptors with similar dimensions value cardinalities logically close. New images are inserted into the distributed databases over the cloud efficiently, by supporting dynamical update in real-time. The proposed insertion algorithm has low computational complexity, depending exclusively on the dimensionality of descriptors and a small subset of descriptors with similar dimensions value cardinalities. Finally, an efficient query processing algorithm is proposed, where the dimensions of image descriptors are prioritized in the searching strategy, assuming that dimensions of high value cardinalities have more discriminative power than the dimensions of low ones. The computation effort of the query processing algorithm is divided into several nodes over the cloud infrastructure. In our experiments with seven publicly available datasets of image descriptors, we show that the proposed similarity search strategy outperforms competitive methods of single node, parallel and cloud-based architectures, in terms of preprocessing cost, search time and accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25687","fieldValue":"ACM"}
