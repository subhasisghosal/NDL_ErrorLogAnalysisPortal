It allows convenient translation of a DAE system into Matlab and provides a small set of easy-to-use functions. DAESA can analyze systems that are fully nonlinear, high-index, and of any order. It determines structural index, number of degrees of freedom, constraints, variables to be initialized, and suggests a solution scheme. The structure of a DAE can be readily visualized by this tool. It can also construct a block-triangular form of the DAE, which can be exploited to solve it efficiently in a block-wise manner."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19404","fieldValue":"Algorithm 948: DAESAâ\u20AC\u201DA Matlab Tool for Structural Analysis of Differential-Algebraic Equations: Software"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19404","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19404","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19405","fieldValue":" The scientific community relies on the peer review process for assuring the quality of published material, the goal of which is to build a body of work we can trust. Computational journals such as the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS) use this process for rigorously promoting the clarity and completeness of content, and citation of prior work. At the same time, it is unusual to independently confirm computational results. ACM TOMS has established a Replicated Computational Results (RCR) review process as part of the manuscript peer review process. The purpose is to provide independent confirmation that results contained in a manuscript are replicable. Successful completion of the RCR process awards a manuscript with the Replicated Computational Results Designation. This issue of ACM TOMS contains the first [Van Zee and van de Geijn 2015] of what we anticipate to be a growing number of articles to receive the RCR designation, and the related RCR reviewer report [Willenbring 2015]. We hope that the TOMS RCR process will serve as a model for other publications and increase the confidence in and value of computational results in TOMS articles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19406","fieldValue":"Van Zee, Field G."}
