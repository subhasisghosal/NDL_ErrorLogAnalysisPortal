It remains a leading cause of cancer-related death for women in developing countries. In order to contribute to the treatment of the cervical cancer, in our work, we try to find a few key genes resulting in the cervical cancer. Employing functions of several bioinformatics tools, we selected 143 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the cervical cancer. The results of bioinformatics analysis show that these DEGs play important roles in the development of cervical cancer. Through comparing two differential co-expression networks (DCNs) at two different states, we found a common sub-network and two differential sub-networks as well as some hub genes in three sub-networks. Moreover, some of the hub genes have been reported to be related to the cervical cancer. Those hub genes were analyzed from Gene Ontology function enrichment, pathway enrichment and protein binding three aspects. The results can help us understand the development of the cervical cancer and guide further experiments about the cervical cancer."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5284","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5285","fieldValue":" Protein sub-cellular localization prediction has attracted much attention in recent years because of its importance for protein function studying and targeted drug discovery, and that makes it to be an important research field in bioinformatics. Traditional experimental methods which ascertain the protein sub-cellular locations are costly and time consuming. In the last two decades, machine learning methods got increasing development, and a large number of machine learning based protein sub-cellular location predictors have been developed. However, most of such predictors can only predict proteins in only one subcellular location. With the development of biology techniques, more and more proteins which have two or even more sub-cellular locations have been found. It is much more significant to study such proteins because they have extremely useful implication for both basic biology and bioinformatics research. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction, much more feature information which can represent the protein sequence should be extracted. In this paper, several feature extraction methods were fused together to extract the feature information, then the multi-label k nearest neighbors (ML-KNN) algorithm was used to predict protein sub-cellular locations. The best overall accuracies we got for dataset s1 in constructing Gpos-mploc is 66.7304 and 59.9206 percent for dataset s2 in constructing Virus-mPLoc."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5285","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/5285","fieldValue":"Multi-label <i>k<\/i> nearest neighbor"}
