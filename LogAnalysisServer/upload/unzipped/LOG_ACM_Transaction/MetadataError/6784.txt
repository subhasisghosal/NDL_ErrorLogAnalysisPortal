The first set of experiments is a pioneering study on the utility of self-assembling robots to address relatively complex scenarios, such as cooperative object transport. The results of our work suggest that the s-bots possess hardware characteristics which facilitate the design of control mechanisms for autonomous self-assembly. The control architecture we developed proved particularly successful in guiding the robots engaged in the cooperative transport task. However, the results also showed that some features of the robots' controllers had a disruptive effect on their performances. The second set of experiments is an attempt to enhance the adaptiveness of our multi-robot system. In particular, we aim to synthesise an integrated (i.e., not-modular) decision-making mechanism which allows the s-bot to autonomously decide whether or not environmental contingencies require self-assembly. The results show that it is possible to synthesize, by using evolutionary computation techniques, artificial neural networks that integrate both the mechanisms for sensory-motor coordination and for decision making required by the robots in the context of self-assembly."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1111","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1111","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1732","fieldValue":"Hsu, Wei-Chung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1732","fieldValue":" Binary Translation (BT) has been commonly used to migrate application software across Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). Some architectures, such as X86, allow Misaligned Data Accesses (MDAs), while most modern architectures require natural data alignments. In a binary translation system, where the source ISA allows MDA and the target ISA does not, memory operations must be carefully translated. Naive translation may cause frequent misaligned data access traps to occur at runtime on the target machine and severely slow down the migrated application. This article evaluates different approaches in handling MDA in a binary translation system including how to identify MDA candidates and how to translate such memory instructions. This article also proposes some new mechanisms to more effectively deal with MDAs. Extensive measurements based on SPEC CPâ\u20AC\u20AC and CPâ\u20AC\u2020 benchmarks show that the proposed approaches are more effective than existing methods and getting close to the performance upper bound of MDA handling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/8099","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"January 2016\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/8124\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, January 2016\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"December 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/8123\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, December 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"October 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/8122\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, October 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"July 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/8121\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, July 2015\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"April 2015\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/8120\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, April 2015\"}]"}
