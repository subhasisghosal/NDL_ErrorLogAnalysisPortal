Such calibration is important for the speed binning process, where the voltage-frequency (V-Fmax) relation needs to be accurately determined to sort chips into different bins that can be used for different applications. Moreover, adaptive systems typically require Fmax calibration at multiple operating points in order to dynamically change operating condition such as supply voltage or body bias for power, temperature, or throughput management. For example, a Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) system requires accurate delay calibration at multiple operating voltages in order to apply the correct operating frequency corresponding to a scaled supply. In this article, we propose a low-overhead design technique that allows efficient characterization of Fmax at different operating voltages and temperatures. The proposed method selects a set of representative timing paths in a circuit based on their temperature and voltage sensitivities and dynamically configures them into a ring oscillator to compute the critical path delay. Compared to existing Fmax$ calibration approaches, the proposed approach provides the following two main advantages: (1) it introduces a delay sensitivity metric to isolate few representative timing paths; (2) it considers actual timing paths instead of critical path replicas, thereby accounting for local within-die delay variations. The all-digital calibration method is robust under process variations and achieves high delay estimation accuracy (> 4&percnt; error) at the cost of negligible design overhead (1.7&percnt; in delay, 0.3&percnt; in power, and 3.5&percnt; in die-area)."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/13178","fieldValue":"<i>F<\/i><sub><i>max<\/i><\/sub> calibration"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13178","fieldValue":"Low-overhead $F_max$ calibration at multiple operating points using delay-sensitivity-based path selection"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13178","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13178","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13179","fieldValue":"Call for papers ACM transactions on design automation of electronic systems (TODAES) special section on low-power electronics and design"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13179","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13179","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13180","fieldValue":" SystemC is a system-level modeling language that offers a wide range of features to describe concurrent systems at different levels of abstraction. The SystemC standard permits simulators to implement a deterministic scheduling policy, which often hides concurrency-related design flaws. We present a novel compiler for SystemC that integrates a very precise formal race analysis by means of model checking. Our compiler produces a simulator that uses the outcome of the analysis to perform partial order reduction. The key insight to make the model checking engine scale is to apply it only to tiny fractions of the SystemC model. We show that the outcome of the analysis is not only valuable to eliminate redundant context switches at runtime, but can also be used to diagnose race conditions statically. In particular, our analysis is able to reveal races that can remain undetected during simulation and is able to formally prove the absence of races."}
