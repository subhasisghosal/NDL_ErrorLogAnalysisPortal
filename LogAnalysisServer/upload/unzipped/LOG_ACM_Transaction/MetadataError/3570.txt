In this article, we present a traffic-adaptive synchronous MAC protocol (TAS-MAC), which is a high-throughput, low-delay MAC protocol tailored for low power consumption. It achieves high throughput by adapting time division multiple access (TDMA) to a novel traffic-adaptive allocation mechanism that assigns time slots only to nodes located on active routes. TAS-MAC reduces the end-to-end delay by notifying all nodes on active routes of incoming traffic in advance. These nodes will claim time slots for data transmission and forward a packet through multiple hops in a cycle. The desirable traffic-adaptive feature is achieved by decomposing traffic notification and data-transmission scheduling into two phases, specializing their duties and improving their efficiency, respectively. Simulation results and experiments on TelosB motes demonstrate that the two-phase design significantly improves the throughput of current synchronous MAC protocols and achieves the similar low delay of slot-stealing-assisted TDMA with much lower power consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21597","fieldValue":"TDMA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21597","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21597","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21598","fieldValue":" In past literature, it has been demonstrated that the use of mobile sinks (MSs) increases dramatically the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In applications where the MSs are humans, animals, or transportation systems, the mobility of the MSs is often uncontrollable and could also be random and unpredictable. This implies the necessity of algorithms tailored to handle uncertainty on the MS mobility. In this article, we define the lifetime optimization of a WSN in the presence of uncontrollable sink mobility and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. After defining an ideal scheme (called Oracle) which provably maximizes network lifetime, we present a novel Swarm-Intelligence-based Sensor Selection Algorithm (SISSA), which optimizes network lifetime and meets predefined QoS constraints. Then we mathematically analyze SISSA and derive analytical bounds on energy consumption, number of messages exchanged, and convergence time. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated on practical experimental setups, and its performances are compared to that by the optimal Oracle scheme, as well as with the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and TDMA schemes. Results conclude that SISSA provides on the average the 56&percnt; of the lifetime provided by Oracle and outperforms IEEE 802.15.4 and TDMA in terms of yielded network lifetime."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21598","fieldValue":"TDMA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21598","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21598","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21599","fieldValue":" This article demonstrates how to use multiple channels to improve communication performance in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We first investigate multichannel realities in WSNs through intensive empirical experiments with Micaz motes. Our study shows that current multichannel protocols are not suitable for WSNs because of the small number of available channels and unavoidable time errors found in real networks. With these observations, we propose a novel tree-based, multichannel scheme for data collection applications, which allocates channels to disjoint trees and exploits parallel transmissions among trees. In order to minimize interference within trees, we define a new channel assignment problem that is proven NP-complete. Then, we propose a greedy channel allocation algorithm that outperforms other schemes in dense networks with a small number of channels. We implement our protocol, called the Tree-based, Multichannel Protocol (TMCP), in a real testbed. To adjust to networks with link quality heterogeneity, an extension of TMCP is also proposed. Through both simulation and real experiments, we show that TMCP can significantly improve network throughput and reduce packet losses. More important, evaluation results show that TMCP better accommodates multichannel realities found in WSNs than other multichannel protocols."}
