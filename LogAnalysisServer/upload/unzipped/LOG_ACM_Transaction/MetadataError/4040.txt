It can be accurately classified using recordings from microphones commonly found in PDAs and other consumer devices. We describe a prototype HMM-based acoustic environment classifier incorporating an adaptive learning mechanism and a hierarchical classification model. Experimental results show that we can accurately classify a wide variety of everyday environments. We also show good results classifying single sounds, although classification accuracy is influenced by the granularity of the classification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1023","fieldValue":" Many code-generator generators use tree pattern matching and dynamic programming. This paper describes a simple program that generates matchers that are fast, compact, and easy to understand. It is simpler than common alternatives: 200â\u20AC\u201C700 lines of Icon or 950 lines of C versus 3000 lines of C for Twig and 5000 for burg. Its matchers run up to 25 times faster than Twig's. They are necessarily slower than burg's BURS (bottom-up rewrite system) matchers, but they are more flexible and still practical."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1023","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1023","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1239","fieldValue":" This work investigates a particular instance of the problem of designing efficient adaptive systems, under the condition that each adaptation decision incurs some nonnegligible cost when enacted. More specifically, we deal with the problem of dynamic, intraquery load balancing in parallel database queries across heterogeneous nodes in a way that takes into account the inherent cost of adaptations and thus avoids both overreacting and deciding when to adapt in a completely heuristic manner. The latter may lead to serious performance degradation in several cases, such as periodic and random imbalances. We follow a control theoretical approach to this problem; more specifically, we propose a multiple-input multiple-output feedback linear quadratic regulation (LQR) controller, which captures the tradeoff between reaching a balanced state and the cost inherent in such adaptations. Our approach, apart from benefitting from and being characterized by a solid theoretical foundation, exhibits better performance than state-of-the-art heuristics in realistic situations, as verified by thorough evaluation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1239","fieldValue":"LQR"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1239","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1239","fieldValue":"ACM"}
