Efficiently answering a user's questions requires identifying the correct set of nodes that can answer the question and enabling coordination between them. In this article, we propose a query domain abstraction that allows an application to dynamically specify the nodes best suited to answering a particular query. Selecting the ideal set of heterogeneous sensors entails answering two fundamental questionsâ\u20AC\u201Dhow are the selected sensors related to one another, and where should the resulting sensor coalition be located. We introduce two abstractions, the proximity function and the reference function, to precisely specify each of these concerns within a query. All nodes in the query domain must satisfy any provided proximity function, a user-defined function that constrains the relative relationship among the group of nodes (e.g., based on a property of the network or physical environment or on logical properties of the nodes). The selected set of nodes must also satisfy any provided reference function, a mechanism to scope the location of the query domain to a specified area of interest (e.g., within a certain distance from a specified reference point). In this article, we model these abstractions and present a set of protocols that accomplish this task with varying degrees of correctness. We evaluate their performance through simulation and highlight the tradeoffs between protocol overhead and correctness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3028","fieldValue":" Recent research on multilingual statistical machine translation focuses on the usage of pivot languages in order to overcome language resource limitations for certain language pairs. Due to the richness of available language resources, English is, in general, the pivot language of choice. However, factors like language relatedness can also effect the choice of the pivot language for a given language pair, especially for Asian languages, where language resources are currently quite limited. In this article, we provide new insights into what factors make a pivot language effective and investigate the impact of these factors on the overall pivot translation performance for translation between 22 Indo-European and Asian languages. Experimental results using state-of-the-art statistical machine translation techniques revealed that the translation quality of 54.8&percnt; of the language pairs improved when a non-English pivot language was chosen. Moreover, 81.0&percnt; of system performance variations can be explained by a combination of factors such as language family, vocabulary, sentence length, language perplexity, translation model entropy, reordering, monotonicity, and engine performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3028","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3028","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21280","fieldValue":" Although the content of sensor messages describing â\u20ACœevents of interestâ\u20AC? may be encrypted to provide confidentiality, the context surrounding these events may also be sensitive and therefore should be protected from eavesdroppers. An adversary armed with knowledge of the network deployment, routing algorithms, and the base-station (data sink) location can infer the temporal patterns of interesting events by merely monitoring the arrival of packets at the sink, thereby allowing the adversary to remotely track the spatio-temporal evolution of a sensed event. In this paper we introduce the problem of temporal privacy for delay-tolerant sensor networks, and propose adaptive buffering at intermediate nodes on the source-sink routing path to obfuscate temporal information from the adversary. We first present the effect of buffering on temporal privacy using an information-theoretic formulation, and then examine the effect that delaying packets has on buffer occupancy. We observe that temporal privacy and efficient buffer utilization are contrary objectives, and then present an adaptive buffering strategy that effectively manages these tradeoffs. Finally, we evaluate our privacy enhancement strategies using simulations, where privacy is quantified in terms of the adversary's mean square error."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21280","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21280","fieldValue":"ACM"}
