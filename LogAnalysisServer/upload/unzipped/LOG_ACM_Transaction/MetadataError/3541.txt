We propose a novel localized algorithm, named Back-Tracking Deployment (BTD). To construct a full coverage solution over the ROI, mobile robots (carriers) carry static sensors as payloads and drop them at the visited empty vertices of a virtual square, triangular, or hexagonal grid. A single robot will move in a predefined order of directional preference until a dead end is reached. Then it back-tracks to the nearest sensor adjacent to an empty vertex (an â\u20ACœentranceâ\u20AC? to an unexplored\/uncovered area) and resumes regular forward movement and sensor dropping from there. To save movement steps, the back-tracking is carried out along a locally identified shortcut. We extend the algorithm to support multiple robots that move independently and asynchronously. Once a robot reaches a dead end, it will back-track, giving preference to its own path. Otherwise, it will take over the back-track path of another robot by consulting with neighboring sensors. We prove that BTD terminates within finite time and produces full coverage when no (sensor or robot) failures occur. We also describe an approach to tolerate failures and an approach to balance workload among robots. We then evaluate BTD in comparison with the only competing algorithms SLD [Chang et al. 2009a] and LRV [Batalin and Sukhatme 2004] through simulation. In a specific failure-free scenario, SLD covers only 40--50&percnt; of the ROI, whereas BTD covers it in full. BTD involves significantly (80&percnt;) less robot moves and messages than LRV."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21521","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21522","fieldValue":" An unprecedented rate of growth in the number of vehicles has resulted in acute road congestion problems worldwide, especially in many developing countries. In this article, we present Road-RFSense, a practical RF sensing--based road traffic estimation system for developing regions. Our first contribution is a new mechanism to sense road occupancy, based on variation in RF link characteristics, when line of sight between a transmitter-receiver pair is obstructed. We design algorithms to classify traffic states into two classes, free-flow versus congested, at timescales of 20 seconds with greater than 90&percnt; accuracy. We also present a traffic queue length measurement system, where a network of RF sensors can correlate the traffic state classification decisions of individual sensors and detect traffic queue length in real time. Deployment of our system on a Mumbai road gives correct estimates, validated against 9 hours of image-based ground truth. Our third contribution is a large-scale data-driven study, in collaboration with city traffic authorities, to answer questions regarding road-specific classification model training. Finally, we explore multilevel classification into seven different traffic states using a larger set of RF-based features and careful choice of classification algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21522","fieldValue":"RSSI"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21522","fieldValue":"SVM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21522","fieldValue":"ACM"}
