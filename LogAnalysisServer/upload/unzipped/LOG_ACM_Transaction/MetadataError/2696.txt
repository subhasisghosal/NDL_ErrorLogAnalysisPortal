{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19003","fieldValue":" A new compact way to store a symmetric or triangular matrix called RPF for Recursive Packed Format is fully described. Novel ways to transform RPF to and from standard packed format are included. A new algorithm, called RPC for Recursive Packed Cholesky, that operates on the RPG format is presented. ALgorithm RPC is basd on level-3 BLAS and requires variants of algorithms TRSM and SYRK that work on RPF. We call these RP_TRSM and RP_SYRK and find that they do most of their work by calling GEMM. It follows that most of the execution time of RPC lies in GEMM. The advantage of this storage scheme compared to traditional packed and full storage is demonstrated. First, the RPC storage format uses the minimal amount of storage for the symmetric or triangular matrix. Second, RPC gives a level-3 implementation of Cholesky factorization whereas standard packed implementations are only level 2. Hence, the performance of our RPC implementation is decidedly superior. Third, unlike fixed block size algorithms, RPC, requires no block size tuning parameter. We present performance measurements on several current architectures that demonstrate improvements over the traditional packed routines. Also MSP parallel computations on the IBM SMP computer are made. The graphs that are attached in Section 7 show that the RPC algorithms are superior by a factor between 1.6 and 7.4 for order around 1000, and between 1.9 and 10.3 for order around 3000 over the traditional packed algorithms. For some architectures, the RPC performance results are almost the same or even better than the traditional full-storage algorithms results."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19003","fieldValue":"BLAS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2838","fieldValue":" Advances in statistical machine learning encourage language-independent approaches to linguistic technology development. Experiments in \"porting\" technologies to handle new natural languages have revealed a great potential for multilingual computing, but also a frustrating lack of linguistic resources for most languages. Recent efforts to address the lack of available resources have focused either on intensive resource development for a small number of languages or development of technologies for rapid porting. The Linguistic Data Consortium recently participated in an experiment falling primarily under the first approach, the surprise language exercise. This article describes linguistic resource creation within this context, including the overall methodology for surveying and collecting language resources, as well as details of the resources developed during the exercise. The article concludes with discussion of a new approach to solving the problem of limited linguistic resources, one that has recently proven effective in identifying core linguistic resources for less common studied languages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19004","fieldValue":" In a recent paper, the present authors derived an automatic continuation algorithm for the solution of linear singular perturbation problems.

The present paper describes how the conintuation algorithm for linear problems can be extended to deal with the nonlinear case. The results of exstensive numerical testing on a set of nonlinear singular perturbation problems are given, and these clearly demonstrate the efficacy of continuation for solving such problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19004","fieldValue":"An automatic continuation strategy for the solution of singularly perturbed nonlinear boundary value problems"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19004","fieldValue":"ACM"}
