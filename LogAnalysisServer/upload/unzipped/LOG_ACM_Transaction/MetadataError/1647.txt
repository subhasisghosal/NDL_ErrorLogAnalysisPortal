Generalizing from example motions or example controllers is one way to provide the required scalability. We present techniques for generalizing a controller for physics-based walking to significantly different tasks, such as climbing a large step up, or pushing a heavy object. Continuation methods solve such problems using a progressive sequence of problems that trace a path from an existing solved problem to the final desired-but-unsolved problem. Each step in the continuation sequence makes progress towards the target problem while further adapting the solution. We describe and evaluate a number of choices in applying continuation methods to adapting walking gaits for tasks involving interaction with the environment. The methods have been successfully applied to automatically adapt a regular cyclic walk to climbing a 65cm step, stepping over a 55cm sill, pushing heavy furniture, walking up steep inclines, and walking on ice. The continuation path further provides parameterized solutions to these problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15953","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15953","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15954","fieldValue":"da Silva, Marco"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15954","fieldValue":" Animating natural human motion in dynamic environments is difficult because of complex geometric and physical interactions. Simulation provides an automatic solution to parts of this problem, but it needs control systems to produce lifelike motions. This paper describes the systematic computation of controllers that can reproduce a range of locomotion styles in interactive simulations. Given a reference motion that describes the desired style, a derived control system can reproduce that style in simulation and in new environments. Because it produces high-quality motions that are both geometrically and physically consistent with simulated surroundings, interactive animation systems could begin to use this approach along with more established kinematic methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15954","fieldValue":"ACM"}
