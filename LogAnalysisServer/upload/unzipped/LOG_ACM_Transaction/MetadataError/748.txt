{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13251","fieldValue":" With VLSI circuit feature size scaling down, it is becoming more difficult and expensive to achieve a desired level of yield. Error-tolerance employs defective chips that occasionally produce erroneous yet acceptable results in targeted applications, and has been proposed as one way to increase effective yield. These chips are characterized by criteria set by specific applications. Error rate, an upper-bound on how frequent errors occur at an output, is one such criterion. In this article we focus on the following problem: given a combinational logic circuit that is defective, and hence occasionally produces an erroneous output, how can we determine the error rate of each output line by using ones counting? The results of this work can also be used for runtime error estimation in aging systems and in environments where soft-errors are produced."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13251","fieldValue":"BIST"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13251","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13251","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13252","fieldValue":"Peng, Huan-Kai"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13252","fieldValue":"Huang, Hsuan-Ming"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13252","fieldValue":"Kuo, Yu-Hsin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13252","fieldValue":"Wen, Charles H-P"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13252","fieldValue":" This article re-examines the soft error effect caused by radiation-induced particles beyond the deep submicron regime. Considering the impact of process variations, voltage pulse widths of transient faults are found no longer monotonically diminishing after propagation, as they were formerly. As a result, the soft error rates in scaled electronic designs escape traditional static analysis and are seriously underestimated. In this article we formulate the statistical soft error rate (SSER) problem and present two frameworks to cope with the aforementioned sophisticated issues. The table-lookup framework captures the change of transient-fault distributions implicitly by using a Monte-Carlo approach, whereas the SVR-learning framework does the task explicitly by using statistical learning theory. Experimental results show that both frameworks can more accurately estimate SERs than static approaches do. Meanwhile, the SVR-learning framework outperforms the table-lookup framework in both SER accuracy and runtime."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13252","fieldValue":"ACM"}
