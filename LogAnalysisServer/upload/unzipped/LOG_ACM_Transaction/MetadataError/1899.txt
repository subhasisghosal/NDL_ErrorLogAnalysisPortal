We developed a new projection-based stereoscopic display for six users, which employs six customized DLP projectors for fast time-sequential image display in combination with polarization. Our intelligent high-speed shutter glasses can be programmed from the application to adapt to the situation. For instance, it does this by staying open if users do not look at the projection screen or switch to a VIP high brightness mode if less than six users use the system. Each user is tracked and can move freely in front of the display while perceiving perspectively correct views of the virtual environment. Navigating a group of six users through a virtual world leads to situations in which the group will not fit through spatial constrictions. Our augmented group navigation techniques ameliorate this situation by fading out obstacles or by slightly redirecting individual users along a collision-free path. While redirection goes mostly unnoticed, both techniques temporarily give up the notion of a consistent shared space. Our user study confirms that users generally prefer this trade-off over na√Øve approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16586","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16586","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16587","fieldValue":" This paper presents a controller for camera convergence and interaxial separation that specifically addresses challenges in interactive stereoscopic applications like games. In such applications, unpredictable viewer- or object-motion often compromises stereopsis due to excessive binocular disparities. We derive constraints on the camera separation and convergence that enable our controller to automatically adapt to any given viewing situation and 3D scene, providing an exact mapping of the virtual content into a comfortable depth range around the display. Moreover, we introduce an interpolation function that linearizes the transformation of stereoscopic depth over time, minimizing nonlinear visual distortions. We describe how to implement the complete control mechanism on the GPU to achieve running times below 0.2ms for full HD. This provides a practical solution even for demanding real-time applications. Results of a user study show a significant increase of stereoscopic comfort, without compromising perceived realism. Our controller enables 'fail-safe' stereopsis, provides intuitive control to accommodate to personal preferences, and allows to properly display stereoscopic content on differently sized output devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16587","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16587","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16588","fieldValue":" This paper addresses stereoscopic view generation from a light field. We present a framework that allows for the generation of stereoscopic image pairs with per-pixel control over disparity, based on multi-perspective imaging from light fields. The proposed framework is novel and useful for stereoscopic image processing and post-production. The stereoscopic images are computed as piecewise continuous cuts through a light field, minimizing an energy reflecting prescribed parameters such as depth budget, maximum disparity gradient, desired stereoscopic baseline, and so on. As demonstrated in our results, this technique can be used for efficient and flexible stereoscopic post-processing, such as reducing excessive disparity while preserving perceived depth, or retargeting of already captured scenes to various view settings. Moreover, we generalize our method to multiple cuts, which is highly useful for content creation in the context of multi-view autostereoscopic displays. We present several results on computer-generated content as well as live-action content."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16588","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16588","fieldValue":"ACM"}
