In our approach, questions are transformed into new queries aimed at maximizing the probability of retrieving answers from existing information retrieval systems. The method involves automatically learning phrase features for classifying questions into different types, automatically generating candidate query transformations from a training set of question\/answer pairs, and automatically evaluating the candidate transformations on target information retrieval systems such as real-world general purpose search engines. At run-time, questions are transformed into a set of queries, and reranking is performed on the documents retrieved. We present a prototype search engine, Tritus, that applies the method to Web search engines. Blind evaluation on a set of real queries from a Web search engine log shows that the method significantly outperforms the underlying search engines, and outperforms a commercial search engine specializing in question answering. Our methodology cleanly supports combining documents retrieved from different search engines, resulting in additional improvement with a system that combines search results from multiple Web search engines."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24302","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24303","fieldValue":" The problem of predicting a user's behavior on a Web site has gained importance due to the rapid growth of the World Wide Web and the need to personalize and influence a user's browsing experience. Markov models and their variations have been found to be well suited for addressing this problem. Of the different variations of Markov models, it is generally found that higher-order Markov models display high predictive accuracies on Web sessions that they can predict. However, higher-order models are also extremely complex due to their large number of states, which increases their space and run-time requirements. In this article, we present different techniques for intelligently selecting parts of different order Markov models so that the resulting model has a reduced state complexity, while maintaining a high predictive accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24304","fieldValue":" User traversals on hyperlinks between Web pages can reveal semantic relationships between these pages. We use user traversals on hyperlinks as weights to measure semantic relationships between Web pages. On the basis of these weights, we propose a novel method to put Web pages on a Web site onto different conceptual levels in a link hierarchy. We develop a clustering algorithm called PageCluster, which clusters conceptually-related pages on each conceptual level of the link hierarchy based on their in-link and out-link similarities. Clusters are then used to construct a conceptual link hierarchy, which is visualized in a prototype called Online Navigation Explorer (ONE) for adaptive Web site navigation. Our experiments show that our method can put Web pages onto conceptual levels of a link hierarchy more accurately than both the breadth-first search method and the shortest-weighted-path method, and PageCluster can cluster conceptually-related pages more accurately than the bibliographic analysis method. Our user study also shows that the conceptual link hierarchy visualized in ONE can help users find information more effectively and efficiently as the task of finding information becomes less specific and involves more Web pages on multiple conceptual levels."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24304","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24304","fieldValue":"ACM"}
