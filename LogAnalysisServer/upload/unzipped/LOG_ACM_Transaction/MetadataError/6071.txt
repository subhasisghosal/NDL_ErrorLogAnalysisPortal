As one can easily imagine, real-life devices are not ideal and information may leak through different physical channels.This paper gives a rigorous definition of leakage immunity and presents several leakage detection tests. In these tests, failure confirms the probable existence of secret-correlated emanations and indicates how likely the leakage is. Success does not refute the existence of emanations but indicates that significant emanations were not detected on the strength of the evidence presented, which of course, leaves the door open to reconsider the situation if further evidence comes to hand at a later date."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6204","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6204","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6205","fieldValue":"Ko, etin K."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6205","fieldValue":" It is widely recognized that data security will play a central role in future IT systems. Providing public-key cryptographic primitives, which are the core tools for security, is often difficult on embedded processor due to computational, memory, and power constraints. This contribution appears to be the first thorough comparison of two public-key families, namely elliptic curve (ECC) and hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems on a wide range of embedded processor types (ARM, ColdFire, PowerPC). We investigated the influence of the processor type, resources, and architecture regarding throughput. Further, we improved previously known HECC algorithms resulting in a more efficient arithmetic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6205","fieldValue":"ACM"}
