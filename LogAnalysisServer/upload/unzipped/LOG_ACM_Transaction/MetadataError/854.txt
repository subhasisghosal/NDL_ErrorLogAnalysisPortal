{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13478","fieldValue":" The performance of many switched-capacitor analog integrated circuits, such as analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and sample and hold circuits, is directly related to their accurate capacitance ratios. In general, capacitor mismatch can result from two sources of errors: random mismatch and systematic mismatch. Paralleling unit capacitance (UC) with a common-centroid structure can alleviate the random mismatch errors. The complexity of generating an optimal solution to the UC placement problem is extremely high, let alone if both placement and routing problems are to be optimized simultaneously. This article evaluates the performance of the UC placement generated in an existing work and proposes an alternative UC placement to achieve optimal ratio mismatch M and better linearity performance of SAR ADC design. Results show that the proposed UC placement achieves a ratio mismatch of M &equals; 0.695, the effective number of bits ENOB &equals; 8.314 bits, and the integral nonlinearity INL &equals; 0.816 LSB (least significant bits) for a 9-bit SAR ADC design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13478","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13479","fieldValue":" This article proposes a novel methodology for robust analog\/mixed-signal IC design by introducing a notion of budget of uncertainty. This method employs a new conic uncertainty model to capture process variability and describes variability-affected circuit design as a set-based robust optimization problem. For a prespecified yield requirement, the proposed method conducts uncertainty budgeting by associating performance yield with the size of uncertainty set for process variations. Hence the uncertainty budgeting problem can be further translated into a tractable robust optimization problem. Compared with the existing robust design flow based on ellipsoid model, this method is able to produce more reliable design solutions by allowing varying size of conic uncertainty set at different design points. In addition, the proposed method addresses the limitation that the size of the ellipsoid model is calculated solely relying on the distribution of process parameters, while neglecting the dependence of circuit performance upon these design parameters. The proposed robust design framework has been verified on various analog\/mixed-signal circuits to demonstrate its efficiency against the ellipsoid model. Up to 24&percnt; reduction of design cost has been achieved by using the uncertainty budgeting-based method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13480","fieldValue":" A digital microfluidic biochip (DMB) is often deployed for multiplexing several assays in space and in time. The residue left by one assay may contaminate the droplets used for subsequent assays. Biochemical assays involving cell culture and those based on particle microfluidics also require sweeping of residual media from an active droplet on-chip. Thus, fluidic operations such as washing or residue removal need to be performed routinely either to clean contamination from the droplet pathways or to rinse off certain droplets on the chip. In this work, several graph-based techniques are presented for offline washing of biochips that may have either a regular geometry (e.g., a 2D array of electrodes), or an irregular geometry (e.g., an application-specific layout). The schemes can be used for total washing, that is, for cleaning the entire biochip or for selective washing of sites or pathways located sparsely on the chip. The problem of reducing the path length and washing time of the droplets is investigated with or without capacity constraints. The proposed algorithms for offline washing make use of several techniques such as graph traversal, integer linear programming (ILP) modeling, and customized heuristics based on the nature of the geometric distribution of the contamination profile. The contaminated pathways are assumed to be Manhattan or curved, and hence the techniques are applicable to the conventional field-actuated DMBs as well as to the emerging classes of light-actuated and active-matrix DMBs. These techniques will be useful in enhancing the reliability of a wide class of emerging digital microfluidic healthcare devices"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13480","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13480","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13481","fieldValue":"Lin, Chung-Wei"}
