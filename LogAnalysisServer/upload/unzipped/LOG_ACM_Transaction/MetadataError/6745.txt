In this article, we study the problem of population anomaly detection, one of the key issues related to event monitoring and population management within a city. Through studying detected population anomalies, we can trace and analyze these anomalies, which could help to model city traffic design and event impact analysis and prediction. Although a significant and interesting issue, it is very hard to detect population anomalies and retrieve anomaly trajectories, especially given that it is difficult to get actual and sufficient population data. To address the difficulties of a lack of real population data, we take advantage of mobile phone networks, which offer enormous spatial and temporal communication data on persons. More importantly, we claim that we can utilize these mobile phone data to infer and approximate population data. Thus, we can study the population anomaly detection problem by taking advantages of unique features hidden in mobile phone data. In this article, we present a system to conduct Population Anomaly Detection (PAD). First, we propose an effective clustering method, correlation-based clustering, to cluster the incomplete location information from mobile phone data (i.e., from mobile call volume distribution to population density distribution). Then, we design an adaptive parameter-free detection method, R-scan, to capture the distributed dynamic anomalies. Finally, we devise an efficient algorithm, BT-miner, to retrieve anomaly trajectories. The experimental results from real-life mobile phone data confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Finally, the proposed methods are realized as a pilot system in a city in China."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7995","fieldValue":" Privacy and security are major concerns for many users of social media. When users share information (e.g., data and photos) with friends, they can make their friends vulnerable to security and privacy breaches with dire consequences. With the continuous expansion of a userâ\u20AC™s social network, privacy settings alone are often inadequate to protect a userâ\u20AC™s profile. In this research, we aim to address some critical issues related to privacy protection: (1) How can we measure and assess individual usersâ\u20AC™ vulnerability&quest; (2) With the diversity of oneâ\u20AC™s social network friends, how can one figure out an effective approach to maintaining balance between vulnerability and social utility&quest; In this work, first we present a novel way to define vulnerable friends from an individual userâ\u20AC™s perspective. User vulnerability is dependent on whether or not the userâ\u20AC™s friendsâ\u20AC™ privacy settings protect the friend and the individualâ\u20AC™s network of friends (which includes the user). We show that it is feasible to measure and assess user vulnerability and reduce oneâ\u20AC™s vulnerability without changing the structure of a social networking site. The approach is to unfriend oneâ\u20AC™s most vulnerable friends. However, when such a vulnerable friend is also socially important, unfriending him or her would significantly reduce oneâ\u20AC™s own social status. We formulate this novel problem as vulnerability minimization with social utility constraints. We formally define the optimization problem and provide an approximation algorithm with a proven bound. Finally, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of a new framework using a Facebook dataset. We resort to experiments and observe how much vulnerability an individual user can be decreased by unfriending a vulnerable friend. We compare performance of different unfriending strategies and discuss the security risk of new friend requests. Additionally, by employing different forms of social utility, we confirm that the balance between user vulnerability and social utility can be practically achieved."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7995","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7995","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7996","fieldValue":"Street, W Nick"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7996","fieldValue":" Finding the most interesting correlations among items is essential for problems in many commercial, medical, and scientific domains. Although there are numerous measures available for evaluating correlations, different correlation measures provide drastically different results. Piatetsky-Shapiro provided three mandatory properties for any reasonable correlation measure, and Tan et al. proposed several properties to categorize correlation measures; however, it is still hard for users to choose the desirable correlation measures according to their needs. In order to solve this problem, we explore the effectiveness problem in three ways. First, we propose two desirable properties and two optional properties for correlation measure selection and study the property satisfaction for different correlation measures. Second, we study different techniques to adjust correlation measures and propose two new correlation measures: the Simplified $Ï\u2021^2 with Continuity Correction and the Simplified Ï\u20212$ with Support. Third, we analyze the upper and lower bounds of different measures and categorize them by the bound differences. Combining these three directions, we provide guidelines for users to choose the proper measure according to their needs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7996","fieldValue":"ACM"}
