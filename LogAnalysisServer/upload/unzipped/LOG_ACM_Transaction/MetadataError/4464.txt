While a great deal of effort has been devoted to solving the phishing problem by prevention and detection of phishing emails and phishing Web sites, little research has been done in the area of training users to recognize those attacks. Our research focuses on educating users about phishing and helping them make better trust decisions. We identified a number of challenges for end-user security education in general and anti-phishing education in particular: users are not motivated to learn about security; for most users, security is a secondary task; it is difficult to teach people to identify security threats without also increasing their tendency to misjudge nonthreats as threats. Keeping these challenges in mind, we developed an email-based anti-phishing education system called â\u20ACœPhishGuruâ\u20AC? and an online game called â\u20ACœAnti-Phishing Philâ\u20AC? that teaches users how to use cues in URLs to avoid falling for phishing attacks. We applied learning science instructional principles in the design of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil. In this article we present the results of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil user studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools. Our results suggest that, while automated detection systems should be used as the first line of defense against phishing attacks, user education offers a complementary approach to help people better recognize fraudulent emails and websites."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24412","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24412","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24413","fieldValue":" In this article, we describe a new approach that gives an explicit probabilistic interpretation for social networks. In particular, we focus on the observation that many existing Web-based trust-inference algorithms conflate the notions of â\u20ACœtrustâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœconfidence,â\u20AC? and treat the amalgamation of the two concepts to compute the trust value associated with a social relationship. Unfortunately, the result of such an algorithm that merges trust and confidence is not a trust value, but rather a new variable in the inference process. Thus, it is hard to evaluate the outputs of such an algorithm in the context of trust inference. This article first describes a formal probabilistic network model for social networks that allows us to address that issue. Then we describe SUNNY, a new trust inference algorithm that uses probabilistic sampling to separately estimate trust information and our confidence in the trust estimate and use the two values in order to compute an estimate of trust based on only those information sources with the highest confidence estimates. We present an experimental evaluation of SUNNY. In our experiments, SUNNY produced more accurate trust estimates than the well-known trust inference algorithm TidalTrust, demonstrating its effectiveness. Finally, we discuss the implications these results will have on systems designed for personalizing content and making recommendations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24413","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24413","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3368","fieldValue":" Previous work in real and virtual settings has shown that the way in which we interact with objects plays a fundamental role in the way we perceive them. This article uses multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis to further characterize and quantify the effects of using different haptic exploratory procedures (EPs) on perceptual similarity spaces. In Experiment 1, 20 participants rated similarity on a set of nine novel, 3D objects varying in shape and texture after either following their contours, laterally rubbing their centers, gripping them, or sequentially touching their tips. MDS analysis was used to recover perceptual maps of the objects and relative weights of perceptual dimensions from similarity data. Both the maps and relative weights of shape\/texture properties were found to vary as a function of the EP used. In addition, large individual differences in the relative weight of shape\/texture were observed. In Experiment 2, 17 of the previous participants repeated Experiment 1 after an average of 105 days. The same patterns of raw similarity ratings, perceptual maps, dimension weights, and individual differences were observed, indicating that perceptual similarities remained stable over time. The findings underscore the role of hand movements and individual biases in shaping haptic perceptual similarity. A framework for validating multimodal virtual displays based on the approach used in the study is also presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3368","fieldValue":"ACM"}
