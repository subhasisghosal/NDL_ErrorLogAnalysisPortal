Thus, an RF supertree is consistent with the maximum number of splits in the input trees. Constructing RF supertrees for rooted and unrooted data is NP-hard. Nevertheless, effective local search heuristics have been developed for the restricted case where the input trees and the supertree are rooted. We describe new heuristics, based on the Edge Contract and Refine (ECR) operation, that remove this restriction, thereby expanding the utility of RF supertrees. Our experimental results on simulated and empirical data sets show that our unrooted local search algorithms yield better supertrees than those obtained from MRP and rooted RF heuristics in terms of total RF distance to the input trees and, for simulated data, in terms of RF distance to the true tree."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4785","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4786","fieldValue":"Moret, Bernard M E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4786","fieldValue":" Comparing two or more phylogenetic trees is a fundamental task in computational biology. The simplest outcome of such a comparison is a pairwise measure of similarity, dissimilarity, or distance. A large number of such measures have been proposed, but so far all suffer from problems varying from computational cost to lack of robustness; many can be shown to behave unexpectedly under certain plausible inputs. For instance, the widely used Robinson-Foulds distance is poorly distributed and thus affords little discrimination, while also lacking robustness in the face of very small changesâ\u20AC\u201Dreattaching a single leaf elsewhere in a tree of any size can instantly maximize the distance. In this paper, we introduce a new pairwise distance measure, based on matching, for phylogenetic trees. We prove that our measure induces a metric on the space of trees, show how to compute it in low polynomial time, verify through statistical testing that it is robust, and finally note that it does not exhibit unexpected behavior under the same inputs that cause problems with other measures. We also illustrate its usefulness in clustering trees, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of hierarchical clustering as compared to the same collections of trees clustered using the Robinson-Foulds distance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4786","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4786","fieldValue":"ACM"}
