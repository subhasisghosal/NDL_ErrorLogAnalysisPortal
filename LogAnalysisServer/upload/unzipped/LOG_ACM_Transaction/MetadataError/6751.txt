Today, millions of people carrying smartphones or tablets are able to communicate practically any time and anywhere they want. They can access their e-mails, comment on weblogs, watch and post videos and photos (as well as comment on them), and make phone calls or text messages almost ubiquitously. Given this scenario, in this article, we tackle a fundamental aspect of this new era of communication: How the time intervals between communication events behave for different technologies and means of communications. Are there universal patterns for the Inter-Event Time Distribution (IED)&quest; How do inter-event times behave differently among particular technologies&quest; To answer these questions, we analyzed eight different datasets from real and modern communication data and found four well-defined patterns seen in all the eight datasets. Moreover, we propose the use of the Self-Feeding Process (SFP) to generate inter-event times between communications. The SFP is an extremely parsimonious point process that requires at most two parameters and is able to generate inter-event times with all the universal properties we observed in the data. We also show three potential applications of the SFP: as a framework to generate a synthetic dataset containing realistic communication events of any one of the analyzed means of communications, as a technique to detect anomalies, and as a building block for more specific models that aim to encompass the particularities seen in each of the analyzed systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8008","fieldValue":"Universal and Distinct Properties of Communication Dynamics: How to Generate Realistic Inter-event Times"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8008","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8008","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8009","fieldValue":" Social influence occurs when oneâ\u20AC™s opinions, emotions, or behaviors are affected by others in a social network. However, social influence takes many forms, and its underlying mechanism is still unclear. For example, how is oneâ\u20AC™s behavior influenced by a group of friends who know each other and by the friends from different ego friend circles&quest; In this article, we study the social influence problem in a large microblogging network. Particularly, we consider usersâ\u20AC™ (re)tweet behaviors and focus on investigating how friends in oneâ\u20AC™s ego network influence retweet behaviors. We propose a novel notion of social influence locality and develop two instantiation functions based on pairwise influence and structural diversity. The defined influence locality functions have strong predictive power. Without any additional features, we can obtain an F1-score of 71.65&percnt; for predicting usersâ\u20AC™ retweet behaviors by training a logistic regression classifier based on the defined influence locality functions. We incorporate social influence locality into a factor graph model, which can further leverage the network-based correlation. Our experiments on the large microblogging network show that the model significantly improves the precision of retweet prediction. Our analysis also reveals several intriguing discoveries. For example, if you have six friends retweeting a microblog, the average likelihood that you will also retweet it strongly depends on the structure among the six friends: The likelihood will significantly drop (only &frac16;) when the six friends do not know each other, compared with the case when the six friends know each other."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8009","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8009","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8010","fieldValue":"Lui, John C S"}
