The solution quality is affected by the representation of the element accesses: a sub-optimal representation leads to overestimation and a non-scalable representation increases the exploration time. We propose a methodology to near-optimal and scalable represent regular and irregular accesses. The representation consists of a set of pattern entries to compactly describe the behavior of the memory accesses and of pattern operations to consistently combine the pattern entries. The result is a final sequence of pattern entries which represents the global access scheme without unnecessary overestimation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10112","fieldValue":"De Pellegrini, Francesco"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10112","fieldValue":" Delay-tolerant ad hoc networks leverage the mobility of relay nodes to compensate for lack of permanent connectivity and thus enable communication between nodes that are out of range of each other. To decrease delivery delay, the information to be delivered is replicated in the network. Our objective in this paper is to study a class of replication mechanisms that include coding in order to improve the probability of successful delivery within a given time limit. We propose an analytical approach that allows to quantify tradeoffs between resources and performance measures (energy and delay). We study the effect of coding on the performance of the network while optimizing parameters that govern routing. Our results, based on fluid approximations, are compared to simulations that validate the model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10112","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10113","fieldValue":" We propose a stateless packet filtering technique based on finite-state automata (FSA). FSAs provide a comprehensive framework with well-defined composition operations that enable the generation of stateless filters from high-level specifications and their compilation into efficient executable code without resorting to various opportunistic optimization algorithms. In contrast with most traditional approaches, memory safety and termination can be enforced with minimal run-time overhead even in cyclic filters, thus enabling full parsing of complex protocols and supporting recursive encapsulation relationships. Experimental evidence shows that this approach is viable and improves the state of the art in terms of filter flexibility, performance, and scalability without incurring in the most common FSA deficiencies, such as state-space explosion."}
