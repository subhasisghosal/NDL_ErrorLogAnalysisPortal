This trend enables a wide variety of emerging applications, for example, mobile location search, landmark recognition, scene reconstruction, and touristic recommendation, which range from purely research prototype to commercial systems. In this article, we give a comprehensive survey on these applications, covering recent advances in recognition and mining of geographical-aware social multimedia. We review related work in the past decade regarding to location recognition, scene summarization, tourism suggestion, 3D building modeling, mobile visual search and city navigation. At the end, we further discuss potential challenges, future topics, as well as open issues related to geo-social multimedia computing, recognition, mining, and analytics."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7599","fieldValue":"When Location Meets Social Multimedia: A Survey on Vision-Based Recognition and Mining for Geo-Social Multimedia Analytics"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7599","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7599","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7600","fieldValue":"Chin, Wei-Sheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7600","fieldValue":"Juan, Yu-Chin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7600","fieldValue":"Lin, Chih-Jen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7600","fieldValue":" Matrix factorization is known to be an effective method for recommender systems that are given only the ratings from users to items. Currently, stochastic gradient (SG) method is one of the most popular algorithms for matrix factorization. However, as a sequential approach, SG is difficult to be parallelized for handling web-scale problems. In this article, we develop a fast parallel SG method, FPSG, for shared memory systems. By dramatically reducing the cache-miss rate and carefully addressing the load balance of threads, FPSG is more efficient than state-of-the-art parallel algorithms for matrix factorization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7600","fieldValue":"ACM"}
