ADAM addresses the joint problem of adaptive beamformer design at the PHY layer and client scheduling at the MAC layer by proposing efficient algorithms that are amenable to practical implementation. ADAM is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform, and its performance is compared against that of omnidirectional and switched beamforming based multicast. Our experimental results reveal that: 1) switched multicast beamforming has limited gains in indoor multipath environments, whose deficiencies can be effectively overcome by ADAM to yield an average gain of threefold; 2) the higher the dynamic range of the discrete transmission rates employed by the MAC hardware, the higher the gains in ADAM's performance, yielding up to ninefold improvement over omni with the 802.11 rate table; and 3) finally, ADAM's performance is susceptible to channel variations due to user mobility and infrequent channel information feedback. However, we show that training ADAM's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-rate mapping to incorporate feedback rate and coherence time significantly increases its robustness to channel dynamics."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10519","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10519","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10519","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10520","fieldValue":"Van Mieghem, Piet"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10520","fieldValue":" Mean-field deterministic epidemic models have been successful in uncovering several important dynamic properties of stochastic epidemic spreading processes over complex networks. In particular, individual-based epidemic models isolate the impact of the network topology on spreading dynamics. In this paper, the existing models are generalized to develop a class of models that includes the spreading process in multilayer complex networks. We provide a detailed description of the stochastic process at the agent level where the agents interact through different layers, each represented by a graph. The set of differential equations that describes the time evolution of the state occupancy probabilities has an exponentially growing state-space size in terms of the number of the agents. Based on a mean-field type approximation, we developed a set of nonlinear differential equations that has linearly growing state-space size. We find that the latter system, referred to as the generalized epidemic mean-field (GEMF) model, has a simple structure characterized by the elements of the adjacency matrices of the network layers and the Laplacian matrices of the transition rate graphs. Finally, we present several examples of epidemic models, including spreading of virus and information in computer networks and spreading of multiple pathogens in a host population."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10520","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10520","fieldValue":"ACM"}
