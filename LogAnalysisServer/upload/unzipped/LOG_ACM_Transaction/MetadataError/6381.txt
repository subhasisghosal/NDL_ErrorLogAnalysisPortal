In this article, we dedicate ourselves to event-based scheduling. We first formally define an event-based scheduling policy and propose the notion of the correctness of a scheduling policy in terms of weak termination. Then we investigate the correctness of the decomposition of scheduling controls and finally obtain a decentralized scheduling method. The method can automatically decompose the scheduling policies of a concurrent reactive system into atomic scheduling policies. Every atomic scheduling policy corresponds to one subsystem. Each of the subsystems is a completely independent system, which may be developed and deployed independently. An experiment demonstrates these results that may help engineers to design correct and efficient schedule policies for a concurrent reactive system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6965","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6965","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1637","fieldValue":" The analysis of program executions reveals that most integer and multimedia applications make heavy use of narrow-width operations, i.e., instructions exclusively using narrow-width operands and producing a narrow-width result. Moreover, this usage is relatively well distributed over the application. We observed this program property on the MediaBench and SPEC2000 benchmarks with about 40&percnt; of the instructions being narrow-width operations. Current superscalar processors use 64-bit datapaths to execute all the instructions of the applications. In this paper, we suggest the use of a width-partitioned microarchitecture (WPM) to master the hardware complexity of a superscalar processor. For a four-way issue machine, we split the processor in two two-way clusters: the main cluster executing 64-bit operations, load\/store, and complex operations and a narrow cluster executing the 16-bit operations. We resort to partitioning to decouple the treatment of the narrow-width operations from that of the other program instructions. This provides the benefit of greatly simplifying the design of the critical processor components in each cluster (e.g., the register file and the bypass network). The dynamic interleaving of the two instruction types allows maintaining the workload balanced among clusters. WPM also helps to reduce the complexity of the interconnection fabric and of the issue logic. In fact, since the 16-bit cluster can only communicate narrow-width data, the datapath-width of the interconnect fabric can be significantly reduced, yielding a corresponding saving of the interconnect power and area. We explore different possible configurations of WPM, discussing the various implementation tradeoffs. We also examine a speculative steering heuristic to distribute the narrow-width operations among clusters. A detailed analysis of the complexity factors shows using WPM instead of a classical 64-bit two-cluster microarchitecture can save power and silicon area with a minimal impact on the overall performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1637","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1637","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6966","fieldValue":" A computational system employed in safety-critical applications typically has reliability as a primary concern. Thus, the designer focuses on minimizing the device radiation-sensitive area, often leading to performance degradation. In this article, we present a mathematical model to evaluate system reliability in spatial (i.e., radiation-sensitive area) and temporal (i.e., performance) terms and prove that minimizing radiation-sensitive area does not necessarily maximize application reliability. To support our claim, we present an empirical counterexample where application reliability is improved even if the radiation-sensitive area of the device is increased. An extensive radiation test campaign using a 28nm commercial-off-the-shelf ARM-based SoC was conducted, and experimental results demonstrate that, while executing the considered application at military aircraft altitude, the probability of executing a two-year mission workload without failures is increased by 5.85&percnt; if L1 caches are enabled (thus increasing the radiation-sensitive area) when compared to no cache level being enabled. However, if both L1 and L2 caches are enabled, the probability is decreased by 31.59&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6966","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6966","fieldValue":"ACM"}
