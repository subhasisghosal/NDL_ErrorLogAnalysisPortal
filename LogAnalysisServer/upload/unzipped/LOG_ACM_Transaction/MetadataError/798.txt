Unlike the conventional serial design that uses cascading cells to perform the serial check, PPRC divides the single path into several segments. All PPRC segments perform the range compare simultaneously, that is, parallel check, and then the results of each segment are serialized to generate the final check result. Besides theoretical analyses, we also use UMC 90nm CMOS process to implement the PPRC design and verify its effect on the check performance. Compared to state-of-the-art range check techniques, the results show that the PPRC design with the best configuration can improve check performance by 28&percnt;, at least. In addition, the PPRC design is more stable and energy efficient than related designs, even though it requires more transistors to implement the peripheral circuitry. The range of energy improvement achieved by the PPRC design is about 35&percnt;--70&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13359","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13359","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13360","fieldValue":" Storage-size management techniques aim to reduce the resources required to store elements and to concurrently provide efficient addressing during element accessing. Existing techniques are less appropriate for large iteration spaces with increased numbers of irregularly spread holes. They either have to approximate the accessed regions, leading to overestimation of the final resources, or they require prohibited exploration time to find the storage size. In this work, we present a near-optimal and scalable methodology for storage-size, intrasignal, in-place optimization, that is, to compute the minimum amount of resources required to store the elements of a group (array), for irregular complex access schemes in the target domain of non-overlapping store and load accesses."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13360","fieldValue":"Near-optimal and scalable intrasignal in-place optimization for non-overlapping and irregular access schemes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13360","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13360","fieldValue":"ACM"}
