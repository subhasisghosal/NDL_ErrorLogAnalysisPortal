{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8032","fieldValue":" Frequent pattern mining is an important data mining problem with many broad applications. Most studies in this field use support (frequency) to measure the popularity of a pattern, namely the fraction of transactions or sequences that include the pattern in a data set. In this study, we introduce a new interesting measure, namely occupancy, to measure the completeness of a pattern in its supporting transactions or sequences. This is motivated by some real-world pattern recommendation applications in which an interesting pattern should not only be frequent, but also occupies a large portion of its supporting transactions or sequences. With the definition of occupancy we call a pattern dominant if its occupancy value is above a user-specified threshold. Then, our task is to identify the qualified patterns which are both dominant and frequent. Also, we formulate the problem of mining top-k qualified patterns, that is, finding k qualified patterns with maximum values on a user-defined function of support and occupancy, for example, weighted sum of support and occupancy. The challenge to these tasks is that the value of occupancy does not change monotonically when more items are appended to a given pattern. Therefore, we propose a general algorithm called DOFRA (DOminant and FRequent pattern mining Algorithm) for mining these qualified patterns, which explores the upper bound properties on occupancy to drastically reduce the search process. Finally, we show the effectiveness of DOFRA in two real-world applications and also demonstrate the efficiency of DOFRA on several real and large synthetic datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1726","fieldValue":" Limit studies on Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) provide apparently contradictory conclusions. On the one hand early limit studies report that DVFS is effective at large timescales (on the order of million(s) of cycles) with large scaling overheads (on the order of tens of microseconds), and they conclude that there is no need for small overhead DVFS at small timescales. Recent work on the other hand‚\u20AC\u201Dmotivated by the surge of on-chip voltage regulator research‚\u20AC\u201Dexplores the potential of fine-grained DVFS and reports substantial energy savings at timescales of hundreds of cycles (while assuming no scaling overhead). This article unifies these apparently contradictory conclusions through a DVFS limit study that simultaneously explores timescale and scaling speed. We find that coarse-grained DVFS is unaffected by timescale and scaling speed, however, fine-grained DVFS may lead to substantial energy savings for memory-intensive workloads. Inspired by these insights, we subsequently propose a fine-grained microarchitecture-driven DVFS mechanism that scales down voltage and frequency upon individual off-chip memory accesses using on-chip regulators. Fine-grained DVFS reduces energy consumption by 12&percnt; on average and up to 23&percnt; over a collection of memory-intensive workloads for an aggressively clock-gated processor, while incurring an average 0.08&percnt; performance degradation (and at most 0.14&percnt;). We also demonstrate that the proposed fine-grained DVFS mechanism is orthogonal to existing coarse-grained DVFS policies, and further reduces energy by 6&percnt; on average and up to 11&percnt; for memory-intensive applications with limited performance impact (at most 0.7&percnt;)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1726","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1726","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8033","fieldValue":"Chen, Hung-Hsuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8033","fieldValue":" In this article, we explore the relationships among digital objects in terms of their similarity based on vertex similarity measures. We argue that SimRank‚\u20AC\u201Da famous similarity measure‚\u20AC\u201Dand its families, such as P-Rank and SimRank++, fail to capture similar node pairs in certain conditions, especially when two nodes can only reach each other through paths of odd lengths. We present new similarity measures ASCOS and ASCOS++ to address the problem. ASCOS outputs a more complete similarity score than SimRank and SimRank‚\u20ACôs families. ASCOS++ enriches ASCOS to include edge weight into the measure, giving all edges and network weights an opportunity to make their contribution. We show that both ASCOS++ and ASCOS can be reformulated and applied on a distributed environment for parallel contribution. Experimental results show that ASCOS++ reports a better score than SimRank and several famous similarity measures. Finally, we re-examine previous use cases of SimRank, and explain appropriate and inappropriate use cases. We suggest future SimRank users following the rules proposed here before na√Øvely applying it. We also discuss the relationship between ASCOS++ and PageRank."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8033","fieldValue":"ASCOS++"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8033","fieldValue":"ACM"}
