In this article, we observe that minimum energy $E_min of subthreshold logic dramatically increases when reaching 45nm CMOS node. We demonstrate by circuit simulation and analytical modeling that this increase comes from the combined effects of variability, gate leakage, and Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) effect. We then investigate the new impact of individual MOSFET parameters Lg, Vt, and Tox on Emin in sub-45nm technologies. We further propose an optimum MOSFET selection, which favors low-Vt mid-Lg devices in 45nm CMOS technology. The use of such optimum MOSFETs yields 35&percnt; Emin reduction for a benchmark multiplier with good speed performances and negligible area overhead. This optimum MOSFET selection can easily be integrated into a standard EDA tool flow by appropriate selection of the standard cell library. We finally demonstrate that undoped-channel fully-depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) technology brings 60&percnt; Emin$ reduction with baseline MOSFETs thanks to strong mitigation of variability and short-channel effects. This study reveals a new (Ã  priori counterintuitive) paradigm in device optimization for subthreshold logic: relaxing gate leakage constraints to improve robustness against short-channel effects and variability. Additionally, we propose pre-Silicon BSIM4 MOSFET model cards for realistic subthreshold circuit simulations including variability in bulk and fully depleted SOI technologies, which are made available online."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13194","fieldValue":"Nanometer MOSFET Effects on the Minimum-Energy Point of Sub-45nm Subthreshold Logic---Mitigation at Technology and Circuit Levels"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13194","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13194","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13195","fieldValue":" The emergence of Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) as the most relevant source of reliability in sub-90nm technologies has led to a new facet of the traditional trade-off between power and reliability. NBTI effects in fact manifest themselves as an increase of the propagation delay of the devices over time, which adds up to the delay penalty incurred by most low-power design solutions. This implies that, given a desired lifetime of a circuit (i.e., a given performance target at some point in time), a power-managed component will fail earlier than a nonpower-managed one. In this work, we show how it is possible to partially overcome this conflict, by leveraging the benefits in terms of aging provided by power-gating (i.e., by using switches that disconnect a logic block from the ground). Thanks to some electrical properties, it is possible to nullify aging effects during standby periods. Based on this important property, we propose a methodology for a NBTI-aware power gating that allows synthesizing low-leakage circuits with maximum lifetime."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13195","fieldValue":"NBTI"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13196","fieldValue":" Many techniques for power reduction in advanced RTL synthesis tools rely explicitly or implicitly on observability donâ\u20AC™t-care conditions. In this article we propose a systematic approach to maximize the effectiveness of these techniques by generating power-friendly RTL descriptions in behavioral synthesis. This is done using operation gating, that is, explicitly adding a predicate to an operation based on its observability condition, so that the operation, once identified as unobservable at runtime, can be avoided using RTL power optimization techniques such as clock gating. We first introduce the concept of behavior-level observability and its approximations in the context of behavioral synthesis. We then propose an efficient procedure to compute an approximated behavior-level observability of every operation in a dataflow graph. Unlike previous techniques which work at the bit level in Boolean networks, our method is able to perform analysis at the word level, and thus avoids most computation effort with a reasonable approximation. Our algorithm exploits the observability-masking nature of some Boolean operations, as well as the select operation, and allows certain forms of other knowledge to be considered for stronger observability conditions. The approximation is proved exact for (acyclic) dataflow graphs when non-Boolean operations other than select are treated as black boxes. The behavior-level observability condition obtained by our analysis can be used to guide the operation scheduler to optimize the efficiency of operation gating. In a set of experiments on real-world designs, our method achieves an average of 33.9&percnt; reduction in total power; it outperforms a previous method by 17.1&percnt; on average and gives close-to-optimal solutions on several designs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time behavior-level observability analysis and optimization are performed during behavioral synthesis in a systematic manner. We believe that our idea can be applied to compiler transformations in general."}
