This has been developed in the framework of a multimodal interface for product design. The interface allows a designer to evaluate the quality of a 3-D shape using touch, vision, and sound. Two important considerations addressed in this article are the nature of the data that is sonified and the haptic interaction between the user and the interface, which in fact triggers the sound and influences its characteristics. Based on these considerations, we present a number of sonification strategies that are designed to map the geometrical data of interest into sound. The fundamental frequency of various sounds was used to convey the curve shape or the curvature to the listeners. Two evaluation experiments are described, one involves partipants with a varied background, the other involved the intended users, i.e. participants with a background in industrial design. The results show that independent of the sonification method used and independent of whether the curve shape or the curvature were sonified, the sonification was quite successful. In the first experiment participants had a success rate of about 80&percnt; in a multiple choice task, in the second experiment it took the participants on average less than 20 seconds to find the maximum, minimum or inflection points of the curvature of a test curve."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25153","fieldValue":" The Quadratic Reduction Framework (QRF) is a numerical modeling framework to evaluate complex stochastic networks composed of resources featuring queueing, blocking, state-dependent behavior, service variability, temporal dependence, or a subset thereof. Systems of this kind are abstracted as network of queues for which QRF supports two common blocking mechanisms: blocking-after-service and repetitive-service random-destination. State-dependence is supported for both routing probabilities and service processes. To evaluate these models, we develop a novel mapping, called Blocking-Aware Quadratic Reduction (BQR), which can describe an intractably large Markov process by a large set of linear inequalities. Each model is then analyzed for bounds or approximate values of performance metrics using optimization programs that provide different levels of accuracy and error guarantees. Numerical results demonstrate that QRF offers very good accuracy and much greater scalability than exact analysis methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25153","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25153","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25154","fieldValue":" Simulation metamodeling is building a statistical model based on simulation output as an approximation to the system performance measure being estimated by the simulation model. In high-dimensional metamodeling problems, larger numbers of design points are needed to build an accurate and precise metamodel. Metamodeling techniques that are functions of all of these design points experience difficulties because of numerical instabilities and high computation times. We introduce a procedure to implement a local smoothing method called Moving Least Squares (MLS) regression in high-dimensional stochastic simulation metamodeling problems. Although MLS regression is known to work well when there are a very large number of design points, current procedures are focused on two- and three-dimensional cases. Furthermore, our procedure accounts for the fact that we can make replications and control the placement of design points in stochastic simulation. We provide a bound on the expected approximation error, show that the MLS predictor is consistent under certain conditions, and test the procedure with two examples that demonstrate better results than other existing simulation metamodeling techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25154","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25154","fieldValue":"ACM"}
