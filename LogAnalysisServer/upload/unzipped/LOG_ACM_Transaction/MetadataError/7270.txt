The performance of channel-aware scheduling algorithms has mostly been explored at the packet level for a static user population, often assuming infinite backlogs. In the present paper, we focus on the performance at the flow level in a dynamic setting with random finite-size service demands. We show that in certain cases the user-level performance may be evaluated by means of a multiclass Processor-Sharing model where the total service rate varies with the total number of users. The latter model provides explicit formulas for the distribution of the number of active users of the various classes, the mean response times, the blocking probabilities, and the throughput. In addition we show that, in the presence of channel variations, greedy, myopic strategies which maximize throughput in a static scenario, may result in sub-optimal throughput performance for a dynamic user configuration and cause potential instability effects."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9357","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9357","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9357","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9358","fieldValue":" There is a growing interest among service providers to offer new services with Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees that are also resilient to failures. Supporting QoS connections requires the existence of a routing mechanism, that computes the QoS paths, i.e., paths that satisfy QoS constraints (e.g., delay or bandwidth). Resilience to failures, on the other hand, is achieved by providing, for each primary QoS path, a set of alternative QoS paths used upon a failure of either a link or a node. The above objectives, coupled with the need to minimize the global use of network resources, imply that the cost of both the primary path and the restoration topology should be a major consideration of the routing process.We undertake a comprehensive study of problems related to finding suitable restoration topologies for QoS paths. We consider both bottleneck QoS constraints, such as bandwidth, and additive QoS constraints, such as delay and jitter. This is the first study to provide a rigorous solution, with proven guarantees, to the combined problem of computing QoS paths with restoration. It turns out that the widely used approach of disjoint primary and restoration paths is not an optimal strategy. Hence, the proposed algorithms construct a restoration topology, i.e., a set of bridges, each bridge protecting a portion of the primary QoS path. This approach guarantees to find a restoration topology with low cost when one exists."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9358","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9359","fieldValue":" The issue of handling network failures is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we address the problem of constrained routing by treating reliability as one of the QoS requirements.The problem is to create a feasible path from a given node to the destination such that the bandwidth and reliability requirements of the path are satisfied and the cost of the path is minimized (Reliability Constrained Least Cost Routing Problem). To solve the problem, we propose an approach which employs a novel concept, called partial protection, wherein backup paths are created for a selected set of domains in the network so as to meet the reliability constraints. The Partial Protection Approach (PPA) has two steps: Primary Path Creation and Backup Path Creation if necessary. To implement PPA, we propose three scalable two-pass resource reservation schemes, viz., Conservative, Optimistic, and Hybrid schemes. These schemes differ depending on whether the backup paths are created during the forward pass, reverse pass, or both. We evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes for dynamic multicast groups with different bandwidth and reliability requirements using average call acceptance rate and average tree cost as performance metrics. Our studies show that group dynamics and reliability requirements have significant impact on the performance of the schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9359","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
