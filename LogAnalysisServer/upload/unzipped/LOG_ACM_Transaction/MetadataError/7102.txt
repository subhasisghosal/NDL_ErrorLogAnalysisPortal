{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9031","fieldValue":" Many connection-oriented networks, such as low Earth orbit satellite (LEOS) systems and networks providing multipriority service using advance reservations, have capacities which vary over time. Connection admission control (CAC) policies which only use current capacity information may lead to intolerable dropping of admitted connections whenever network capacity decreases. We present the admission limit curve (ALC) for capacity-varying networks with random capacity change times. We prove the ALC is a constraint limiting the conditions under which any connection-stateless CAC policy may admit connections and still meet dropping guarantees on an individual connection basis. The ALC also leads to a lower bound on the blocking performance achievable by any connection-stateless CAC policy which provides dropping guarantees to individual connections. In addition, we describe a CAC policy for stochastic capacity change times which uses knowledge about future capacity changes to provide dropping guarantees on an individual connection basis and which achieves blocking performance close to the lower bound."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9031","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9031","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9031","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9032","fieldValue":" In this paper, we develop performance models of the Broadcast and Unkn own Server (BUS) in the LANE. The traffic on the BUS is divided into two classes: the broadcast and multicast traffic, and the unicast relay flow. The broadcast and multicast traffic is assumed to form a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). The traffic for a particular unicast relay flow is an MMPP as well. However, the number of active unicast relay flows sojourning on the BUS is determined by a tandem queueing system, where the flow arrival process is Poisson, the address resolution delay is exponentially distributed, and the connection setup delay is three-stage Erlang distributed. The size of data frames in traffic flows is a random variable with three possible values: short, medium, and large. In order to deal with the intractability (i.e., largeness and stiffness) of the underlying Markov chain, a hierarchical model is used to decompose the system. With the help of Stochastic Petri Net Package (SPNP), a software package for the automated generation and solution of Markovian stochastic systems, and the decomposition method, we study the performance of the BUS module under different loads. We also investigate the effect of address resolution delay and connection setup delay on the performance of the BUS."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9032","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9032","fieldValue":"ATM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9033","fieldValue":" Saha, Mukherjee, and Tripathi [1] present and analyze an ATM cell scheduling algorithm called carry-over round robin. Unfortunately, one of the basic lemmas in their paper, related to the performance of this algorithm, does not hold. This adversely affects the delay and fairness properties that they subsequently derive. To substantiate this, we briefly describe carry-over round robin and present a counterexample to the lemma. We end with some concluding remarks."}
