Adapting representation-theoretic results from recent investigations of Markov invariants for the general rate matrix model, we give a prescription for identifying and counting Markov invariants for such \"symmetric embeddedâ\u20AC? models, and we provide enumerations of these for the first few cases with a small number of character states. The simplest example is a target model on three states, constructed from a general 2 state model; the \"2 \\hookrightarrow3â\u20AC? embedding. We show that for 2 taxa, there exist two invariants of quadratic degree that can be used to directly infer pairwise distances from observed sequences under this model. A simple simulation study verifies their theoretical expected values, and suggests that, given the appropriateness of the model class, they have superior statistical properties than the standard (log) Det invariant (which is of cubic degree for this case)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4765","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4765","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4765","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4766","fieldValue":"Yang, Cheng-Hong"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4766","fieldValue":"Cheng, Yu-Huei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4766","fieldValue":"Yang, Cheng-Huei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4766","fieldValue":"Chuang, Li-Yeh"}
