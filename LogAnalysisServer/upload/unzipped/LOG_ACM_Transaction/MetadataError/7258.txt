Most available studies on EB focus on the stability of the algorithm and little attention has been paid to the performance analysis of EB. In this paper, we analyze EB and obtain saturation throughput and medium access delay of a packet for a given number of nodes N. The analysis considers the general case of EB with backoff factor r; binary exponential backoff (BEB) algorithm is the special case with r = 2. We also derive the analytical performance of EB with maximum retry limit M(EB-M), a practical version of EB. The accuracy of the analysis is checked against simulation results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9334","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9334","fieldValue":"BEB"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9334","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9334","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9335","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present a model for TCP\/IP congestion control mechanism. The rate at which data is transmitted increases linearly in time until a packet loss is detected. At this point, the transmission rate is divided by a constant factor. Losses are generated by some exogenous random process which is assumed to be stationary ergodic. This allows us to account for any correlation and any distribution of inter-loss times. We obtain an explicit expression for the throughput of a TCP connection and bounds on the throughput when there is a limit on the window size. In addition, we study the effect of the Timeout mechanism on the throughput. A set of experiments is conducted over the real Internet and a comparison is provided with other models that make simple assumptions on the inter-loss time process. The comparison shows that our model approximates well the throughput of TCP for many distributions of inter-loss times."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9335","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9335","fieldValue":"TCP\/IP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9335","fieldValue":"ACM"}
