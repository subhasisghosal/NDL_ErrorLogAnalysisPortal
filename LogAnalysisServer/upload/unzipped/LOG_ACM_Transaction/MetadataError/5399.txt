The inferred gene regulatory network (GRN) is based on the time series gene expression data capturing the underlying gene interactions. For constructing a highly accurate GRN, the proposed method performs: 1) discovery of a gene's Markov Blanket (MB), 2) formulation of a flexible measure to determine the network's quality, 3) efficient searching with the aid of a guided genetic algorithm, and 4) pruning to obtain a minimal set of correct interactions. Investigations are carried out using both synthetic as well as yeast cell cycle gene expression data sets. The realistic synthetic data sets validate the robustness of the method by varying topology, sample size, time delay, noise, vertex in-degree, and the presence of hidden nodes. It is shown that the proposed approach has excellent inferential capabilities and high accuracy even in the presence of noise. The gene network inferred from yeast cell cycle data is investigated for its biological relevance using well-known interactions, sequence analysis, motif patterns, and GO data. Further, novel interactions are predicted for the unknown genes of the network and their influence on other genes is also discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4572","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4572","fieldValue":"Cause-effect analysis, causal modeling, gene regulatory network, genetic algorithms, microarray gene expression data, network inference."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4572","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4572","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4573","fieldValue":" Protein identification is a key and essential step in mass spectrometry (MS) based proteome research. To date, there are many protein identification strategies that employ either MS data or MS\/MS data for database searching. While MS-based methods provide wider coverage than MS\/MS-based methods, their identification accuracy is lower since MS data have less information than MS\/MS data. Thus, it is desired to design more sophisticated algorithms that achieve higher identification accuracy using MS data. Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF) has been widely used to identify single purified proteins from MS data for many years. In this paper, we extend this technology to protein mixture identification. First, we formulate the problem of protein mixture identification as a Partial Set Covering (PSC) problem. Then, we present several algorithms that can solve the PSC problem efficiently. Finally, we extend the partial set covering model to both MS\/MS data and the combination of MS data and MS\/MS data. The experimental results on simulated data and real data demonstrate the advantages of our method: 1) it outperforms previous MS-based approaches significantly; 2) it is useful in the MS\/MS-based protein inference; and 3) it combines MS data and MS\/MS data in a unified model such that the identification performance is further improved."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4573","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4573","fieldValue":"Protein identification, proteomics, peptide mass fingerprinting, mass spectrometry, set covering, linear programming, optimization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4573","fieldValue":"ACM"}
