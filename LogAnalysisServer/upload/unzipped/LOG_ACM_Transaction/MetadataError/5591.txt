These may be the result of both gene mutations that lead to intrinsic perturbations and environmental changes that may stimulate signaling in the body. Therefore, analysis of network robustness to tolerate intrinsic perturbations and network response ability of gene networks to respond to external stimuli during the aging process may provide insight into the systematic changes caused by aging. We first propose novel methods to estimate network robustness and measure network response ability of gene regulatory networks by using their corresponding microarray data in the aging process. Then, we find that an aging-related gene network is more robust to intrinsic perturbations in the elderly than the young, and therefore is less responsive to external stimuli. Finally, we find that the response abilities of individual genes, especially FOXOs, NF-ÎºB, and p53, are significantly different in the young versus the aged subjects. These observations are consistent with experimental findings in the aged population, e.g., elevated incidence of tumorigenesis and diminished resistance to oxidative stress. The proposed method can also be used for exploring and analyzing the dynamic properties of other biological processes via corresponding microarray data to provide useful information on clinical strategy and drug target selection."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4916","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4916","fieldValue":"Robustness,Aging,Stress,Mice,Diseases,Systematics,network robustness,Robustness,Aging,Stress,Mice,Diseases,Systematics,network response ability,Gene regulatory network,network analysis,systems biology,aging"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4916","fieldValue":"On the Increase in Network Robustness and Decrease in Network Response Ability during the Aging Process: A Systems Biology Approach via Microarray Data"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4916","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4916","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4917","fieldValue":"DeRonne, Kevin W."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4917","fieldValue":" Sequence alignment using evolutionary profiles is a commonly employed tool when investigating a protein. Many profile-profile scoring functions have been developed for use in such alignments, but there has not yet been a comprehensive study of Pareto optimal pairwise alignments for combining multiple such functions. We show that the problem of generating Pareto optimal pairwise alignments has an optimal substructure property, and develop an efficient algorithm for generating Pareto optimal frontiers of pairwise alignments. All possible sets of two, three, and four profile scoring functions are used from a pool of 11 functions and applied to 588 pairs of proteins in the ce_ref data set. The performance of the best objective combinations on ce_ref is also evaluated on an independent set of 913 protein pairs extracted from the BAliBASE RV11 data set. Our dynamic-programming-based heuristic approach produces approximated Pareto optimal frontiers of pairwise alignments that contain comparable alignments to those on the exact frontier, but on average in less than 1\/58th the time in the case of four objectives. Our results show that the Pareto frontiers contain alignments whose quality is better than the alignments obtained by single objectives. However, the task of identifying a single high-quality alignment among those in the Pareto frontier remains challenging."}
