We showed participants stereo photographs with different depths of field using a Wheatstone stereoscope and a commercially available 3D TV. The depicted scene contained a floor, a background, and a measuring probe at different locations. Participants drew a floor plan of the depicted scene to scale. We found that perceived depth decreased with decreasing depth of field for shallow depths of field in scenes containing a height-in-the-field cue. For larger depths of field, different effects were found depending on the display system and the viewing distance. There was no effect on perceived depth using the 3D TV, but perceived depth decreased with increasing depth of field using the Wheatstone stereoscope. However, in the 3D TV case, we found that the perceived depth decreased with increasing depth of field in scenes in which the height-in-the-field cue was removed. This indicates that the effect of depth of field on perceived depth may be influenced by other depth cues in the scene, such as height-in-the-field cues."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3483","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25734","fieldValue":" Points of interest are an important requirement for location-based services, yet they are editorially curated and maintained, either professionally or through community. Beyond the laborious manual annotation task, further complications arise as points of interest may appear, relocate, or disappear over time, and may be relevant only to specific communities. To assist, complement, or even replace manual annotation, we propose a novel method for the automatic localization of points of interest depicted in photos taken by people across the world. Our technique exploits the geographic coordinates and the compass direction supplied by modern cameras, while accounting for possible measurement errors due to the variability in accuracy of the sensors that produced them. We statistically demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms techniques from the research literature on the task of estimating the geographic coordinates and geographic footprints of points of interest in various cities, even when photos are involved in the estimation process that do not show the point of interest at all."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25734","fieldValue":"GPS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25734","fieldValue":"ACM"}
