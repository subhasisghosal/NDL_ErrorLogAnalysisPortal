Effectively, the nested arrays provide a priori knowledge of prospective loudspeaker locations based on the frequency bands of interest. The nested arrays are then further optimized in the Lasso stage to form an efficient loudspeakers' location dictionary. The final loudspeaker locations and weightings are estimated by a two-stage Lasso-LS pressure matching optimization. In the first stage Lasso algorithm, the center band frequencies of octave bands from 1 kHz to 8 kHz were used to select active loudspeakers. A second stage then optimizes reproduction using all selected loudspeakers on the basis of a regularized LS algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a solution for the multizone sound system with the mean squared error (MSE) under -30 dB across the targeted frequency range (500 Hz-16 kHz) using a linear array e.g. 13 loudspeakers. While, the single-stage LS approach generates the MSE peaks of -10 dB and -9 dB at 9 kHz within the active and silent zones respectively using an identical number of loudspeakers and array length."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3992","fieldValue":" The bandwidth limitation of wideband audio systems degrades the subjective quality and naturalness of audio signals. In this paper, a new method for blind bandwidth extension of wideband audio signals is proposed based on ensemble echo state network with temporal evolution. The high-frequency components in the band of 7 âˆ¼ 14 kHz are artificially restored only from the information in the wideband audio. For each region in the wideband feature space, a specific echo state network with recurrent structure is explored to dynamically model the local mapping relationship between wideband audio features and high-frequency spectral envelope. The transition process among regions is modeled by a hidden Markov model, and a network ensemble technique based on temporal evolution is used to fuse multiple echo state networks such that the high-frequency spectral envelope is estimated. Combining the high-frequency fine spectrum extended by spectral translation, the proposed method can effectively extend the wideband audio to super wideband. In addition, the proposed extension method is applied to the ITU-T G.729.1 wideband audio codec and is further evaluated in comparison with the ITU-T G.729.1 Annex E super-wideband audio codec and the hidden Markov model-based reference bandwidth extension method. Objective quality evaluation results indicate that the proposed method is preferred over the hidden Markov model-based reference bandwidth extension method in terms of log spectral distortion, cosh measure, and differential log spectral distortion. Further, the proposed method improves the auditory quality of the wideband audio and also gains a good performance in the subjective listening tests."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3992","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3992","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3993","fieldValue":"van de Par, Steven"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3993","fieldValue":" As an alternative to traditional artificial heads, it is possible to synthesize individual head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) using a so-called virtual artificial head (VAH), consisting of a microphone array with an appropriate topology and filter coefficients optimized using a narrowband least squares cost function. The resulting spatial directivity pattern of such a VAH is known to be sensitive to small deviations of the assumed microphone characteristics, e.g., gain, phase and\/or the positions of the microphones. In many beamformer design procedures, this sensitivity is reduced by imposing a white noise gain (WNG) constraint on the filter coefficients for a single desired look direction. In this paper, this constraint is shown to be inappropriate for regularizing the HRTF synthesis with multiple desired directions and three alternative different regularization approaches are proposed and evaluated. In the first approach, the measured deviations of the microphone characteristics are taken into account in the filter design. In the second approach, the filter coefficients are regularized using the mean WNG for all directions. The third approach additionally takes into account several frequency bins into both the optimization and the regularization. The different proposed regularization approaches are compared using analytic and measured transfer functions, including random deviations. Experimental results show that the approach using multiple frequency bands mimicking the spectral resolution of the human auditory system yields the best robustness among the considered regularization approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3993","fieldValue":"ACM"}
