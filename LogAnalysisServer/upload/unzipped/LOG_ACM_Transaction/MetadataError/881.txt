Memory-based wear leveling (WL) is an effective way to improve PCM endurance, but its major challenge is how to efficiently determine the appropriate memory pages for allocation or swapping. In this article, we present a constant-cost WL design that is compatible with existing memory management. Two implementations, namely bucket-based and array-based WL, with constant-time (or nearly zero) search cost are proposed to be integrated into the OS layer and the hardware layer, respectively, as well as to trade between time and space complexity. The results of experiments conducted based on an implementation in Android, as well as simulations with popular benchmarks, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design are very encouraging."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13544","fieldValue":"ACM"}
