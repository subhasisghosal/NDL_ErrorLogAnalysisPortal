The main feature is that it robustly and within a few seconds generates interesting motion from a sparse set of spacetime constraints. Providing only partial (as opposed to full) keyframes for positions and velocities is sufficient. The computed motion satisfies the constraints and the remaining degrees of freedom are determined by physical principles using elasticity and the spacetime constraints paradigm. Our modeling of the spacetime optimization problem combines dimensional reduction, modal coordinates, wiggly splines, and rotation strain warping. Our solver is based on a theorem that characterizes the solutions of the optimization problem and allows us to restrict the optimization to low-dimensional search spaces. This treatment of the optimization problem avoids a time discretization and the resulting method can robustly deal with sparse input and wiggly motion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17102","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17102","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17103","fieldValue":"de Joya, Juan Miguel"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17103","fieldValue":"OBrien, James F."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17103","fieldValue":" This paper presents a method for adaptive fracture propagation in thin sheets. A high-quality triangle mesh is dynamically restructured to adaptively maintain detail wherever it is required by the simulation. These requirements include refining where cracks are likely to either start or advance. Refinement ensures that the stress distribution around the crack tip is well resolved, which is vital for creating highly detailed, realistic crack paths. The dynamic meshing framework allows subsequent coarsening once areas are no longer likely to produce cracking. This coarsening allows efficient simulation by reducing the total number of active nodes and by preventing the formation of thin slivers around the crack path. A local reprojection scheme and a substepping fracture process help to ensure stability and prevent a loss of plasticity during remeshing. By including bending and stretching plasticity models, the method is able to simulate a large range of materials with very different fracture behaviors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17103","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17103","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17104","fieldValue":" Many visually interesting natural phenomena are characterized by thin liquid sheets, long filaments, and droplets. We present a new Lagrangian-based numerical method to simulate these codimensional surface tension driven phenomena using non-manifold simplicial complexes. Tetrahedra, triangles, segments, and points are used to model the fluid volume, thin films, filaments, and droplets, respectively. We present a new method for enforcing fluid incompressibility on simplicial complexes along with a physically-guided meshing algorithm to provide temporally consistent information for interparticle forces. Our method naturally allows for transitions between codimensions, either from tetrahedra to triangles to segments to points or vice versa, regardless of the simulation resolution. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method by simulating various natural phenomena that are characterized by thin fluid sheets, filaments, and surface tension effects."}
