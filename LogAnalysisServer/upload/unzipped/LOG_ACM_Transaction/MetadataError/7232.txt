Evaluation of Internet protocols usually uses random scenarios or scenarios based on designers' intuition. Such approach may be useful for average case analysis but does not cover boundary-point (worst or best case) scenarios. To synthesize boundary-point scenarios, a more systematic approach is needed.In this paper, we present a method for automatic synthesis of worst and best case scenarios for protocol boundary-point evaluation. Our method uses a fault-oriented test generation (FOTG) algorithm for searching the protocol and system state space to synthesize these scenarios. The algorithm is based on a global finite state machine (FSM) model. We extend the algorithm with timing semantics to handle end-to-end delays and address performance criteria. We introduce the notion of a virtual LAN to represent delays of the underlying multicast distribution tree. Our algorithms utilize implicit backward search using branch and bound techniques and start from given target events.As a case study, we use our method to evaluate variants of the timer suppression mechanism, used in various multicast protocols, with respect to two performance criteria: overhead of response messages and response time. Simulation results for reliable multicast protocols show that our method provides a scalable way for synthesizing worst case scenarios automatically. Results obtained using stress scenarios differ dramatically from those obtained through average case analyses. We hope for our method to serve as a model for applying systematic evaluation to other multicast protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9282","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9282","fieldValue":"The STRESS method for boundary-point performance analysis of end-to-end multicast timer-suppression mechanisms"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9282","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9282","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9283","fieldValue":" We propose a new approach to constraint-based path selection for dynamic routing and wavelength allocation in optical networks based on WDM. Our approach considers service-specific path quality attributes, such as physical layer impairments, reliability, policy, and traffic conditions, and uses a flooding-based transfer of path information messages from source to destination to find multiple feasible paths. It is fully decentralized, as it uses local network state information. To better understand howmultiple constraints impact the efficiency of wavelength routing, and consequently provision the service guarantees, we specifically focus on electronic regenerators that, while being widely considered as the basic building blocks for optical switching nodes, are likely to impose conflicting constraints on routing. For example, electronic regenerators extend the optical reach and could perform wavelength shifting, but also induce impairments, such as delays and operational costs. The question for constraint-based routing is how to account for these conflicting effects. To validate the network modeling, a wide range of networking scenarios are simulated, such as ring, mesh and interconnections of all-optical networks with electronic gateways. For all these scenarios, our approach is shown to efficiently accommodate multiple, conflicting routing metrics related to different services and network architectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9283","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
