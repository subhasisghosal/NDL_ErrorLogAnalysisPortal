However, the complexity and diversity of the underwater environment differentiate it significantly from the terrestrial environment. In particular, the coverage requirements (i.e., coverage degrees and coverage probabilities) at different regions probably differ underwater. Nevertheless, little effort has been made so far on the topology control of UWSNs given the diverse coverage requirements. To this end, this article proposes two algorithms for the diverse coverage problem in UWSNs: (1) Traversal Algorithm for Diverse Coverage (TADC), which adjusts the sensing radii of nodes successively, that is, at each round only one node alters its sensing radius, and (2) Radius Increment Algorithm for Diverse Coverage (RIADC), which sets the sensing radii of nodes incrementally, that is, at each round multiple nodes may increase their sensing radii simultaneously. The performances of TADC and RIADC are analyzed through mathematical analysis and simulations. The results reveal that both TADC and RIADC can achieve the diverse coverage while minimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, TADC and RIADC perform nicely in obtaining optimal sensing radii and reducing message complexity, respectively. Such merits further indicate that TADC and RIADC are suitable for small-scale and large-scale UWSNs, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1356","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1356","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4600","fieldValue":" Glycans are molecules made from simple sugars that form complex tree structures. Glycans constitute one of the most important protein modifications and identification of glycans remains a pressing problem in biology. Unfortunately, the structure of glycans is hard to predict from the genome sequence of an organism. In this paper, we consider the problem of deriving the topology of a glycan solely from tandem mass spectrometry (MS) data. We study, how to generate glycan tree candidates that sufficiently match the sample mass spectrum, avoiding the combinatorial explosion of glycan structures. Unfortunately, the resulting problem is known to be computationally hard. We present an efficient exact algorithm for this problem based on fixed-parameter algorithmics that can process a spectrum in a matter of seconds. We also report some preliminary results of our method on experimental data, combining it with a preliminary candidate evaluation scheme. We show that our approach is fast in applications, and that we can reach very well de novo identification results. Finally, we show how to count the number of glycan topologies for a fixed size or a fixed mass. We generalize this result to count the number of (labeled) trees with bounded out degree, improving on results obtained using PÃ³lya's enumeration theorem."}
