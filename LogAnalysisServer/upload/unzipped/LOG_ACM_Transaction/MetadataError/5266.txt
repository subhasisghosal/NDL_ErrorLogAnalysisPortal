{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4323","fieldValue":" One important application of gene expression analysis is to classify tissue samples according to their gene expression levels. Gene expression data are typically characterized by high dimensionality and small sample size, which makes the classification task quite challenging. In this paper, we present a data-dependent kernel for microarray data classification. This kernel function is engineered so that the class separability of the training data is maximized. A bootstrapping-based resampling scheme is introduced to reduce the possible training bias. The effectiveness of this adaptive kernel for microarray data classification is illustrated with a k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier. Our experimental study shows that the data-dependent kernel leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of KNN classifiers. Furthermore, this kernel-based KNN scheme has been demonstrated to be competitive to, if not better than, more sophisticated classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and the Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis (ULDA) for classifying gene expression data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4323","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4323","fieldValue":"Microarray data analysis, cancer classification, kernel machines, kernel optimization, bootstrapping resampling"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4324","fieldValue":" We focus on finding a consensus motif of a set of homologous or functionally related RNA molecules. Recent approaches to this problem have been limited to simple motifs, require sequence alignment, and make prior assumptions concerning the data set. We use genetic programming to predict RNA consensus motifs based solely on the data set. Our system -- dыпн GeRNAMo (Genetic programming of RNA Motifs) -- predicts the most common motifs without sequence alignment and is capable of dealing with any motif size. Our program only requires the maximum number of stems in the motif, and if prior knowledge is available the user can specify other attributes of the motif (e.g., the range of the motif's minimum and maximum sizes), thereby increasing both sensitivity and speed. We describe several experiments using either ferritin iron response element (IRE); signal recognition particle (SRP); or microRNA sequences, showing that the most common motif is found repeatedly, and that our system offers substantial advantages over previous methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4324","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1331","fieldValue":" In this article, we explore the topic of extending aggregate computation in distributed networks with self-stabilizing properties to withstand network dynamics. Existing research suggests that fast gossiping algorithms, based on the properties of order statistics applied to families of exponential random variables, are a viable solution for computing functions of the values stored in the network. We focus on the specific case in which network changes and failures occur in batches with a minimum frequency in the order of the diameter of the network. Our contribution consists in two self-stabilizing mechanisms, allowing fast gossiping algorithms to be applicable to dynamic networks with minor increase in resources usage. The resulting algorithms can be deployed in networks exhibiting churn, node stop-failures and resets, and random topological changes. The theoretical results are verified with simulations on synthetic data, showcasing desirable properties for large-scale network designers such as scalability, lack of single points of failure, and anonymity."}
