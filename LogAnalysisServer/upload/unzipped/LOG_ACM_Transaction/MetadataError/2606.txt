The focus is on shared memory architectures. Each approach to parallelization is described in detail, along with a discussion of the effort involved. Performance on a test problem, using up to sixteen processors of a Sequent Symmetry S81, is reported and discussed. Implications for the parallelization of a broad class of mathematical software are drawn."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18769","fieldValue":"ELLPACK"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18769","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18769","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18770","fieldValue":" Let 0 â\u2030¤ 1 and F be the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the F-Distribution. We wish to find xp such that F(xp|n1, n2) = p, where n1 and n2 are the degrees of freedom. Traditionally, xp is found using a numerical root-finding method, such as Newton's method. In this paper, a procedure based on a series expansion for finding xpis given. The series expansion method has been applied to the normal, chi-square, and t distributions, but because of computational difficulties, it has not been applied to the F-Distribution. These problems have been overcome by making the standard transformation to the beta distribution.The procedure is explained in Sections 3 and 4. Empirical results of a comparison of CPU times are given in Section 5. The series expansion is compared to some of the standard root-finding methods. A table is given for p = .90."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/18770","fieldValue":"<italic>F<\/italic>-distribution"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18770","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18770","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18771","fieldValue":" Let 0â\u2020? p â\u2020?1 be given and let F be the cumulative distribution function of the F-Distribution with (M, N,) degrees of freedom.
