Many papers have proposed methods for improving the network reliability of WSNs. However, real WSN deployments show that sensor data-faults are very common. Several server-side data reliability techniques have been proposed to detect these faults and impute missing or erroneous data. Typically, these techniques reduce the lifetime of the network due to redundant data transmission, increase latency, and are computation and storage intensive. Herein, we propose Packet-Level Attestation (PLA), a novel framework for sensor data reliability assessment. It exploits the spatial correlation of data sensed at nearby sensors. The method does not incur additional transmission of control message between source and sink; instead, a verifier node sends a validation certificate as part of the regular data packet. PLA was implemented in TinyOS on TelosB motes and its performances was assessed. Simulations were performed to determine its scalability. It incurs only an overhead of 1.45&percnt; in terms of packets transmitted. Fault detection precision of the framework varied from 100&percnt; to 99.48&percnt;. Comparisons with existing methods for data reliability analysis showed a significant reduction in data transmission, prolonging the network lifetime."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21415","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2422966.2422976\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21416","fieldValue":"Lai, Ted Tsung-Te"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21416","fieldValue":"Chen, Wei-Ju"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21416","fieldValue":"Chen, Yu-Han Tiffany"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21416","fieldValue":"Chu, Hao-Hau"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21416","fieldValue":" This study presents several extensions to our previous work on the PipeProbe system, a mobile sensor system for identifying the spatial topology of hidden water pipelines (i.e., non-moldable pipes such as copper and PVC) behind walls or under floors [Lai et al. 2010]. The PipeProbe system works by dropping a tiny wireless sensor capsule into the source of a water pipeline. As the PipeProbe capsule traverses the pipelines, it gathers and transmits pressure and angular velocity readings. Through spatiotemporal analysis of these sensor readings, the proposed algorithm locates all turning points in the pipelines and maps their 3D spatial topology. This study expands upon previous research by developing new sensing techniques that identify variable-diameter pipes and differentiate 90-degree pipe turns from 45-degree pipe bends."}
