Radiation particles that hit the device can cause errors in some cells, which can lead to data corruption. To avoid this problem, memories are protected with per-word error correction codes (ECCs). Typically, single-error correction and double-error detection (SEC-DED) codes are used. As technology scales, errors caused by radiation particles on memories tend to affect more than one cellâ\u20AC\u201Dwhat is known as a multiple cell upset (MCU). To ensure that only a single cell is affected in each word, interleaving is used. With interleaving, cells that belong to the same word are placed at a sufficient distance such that an MCU will only affect a single cell on each word. The use of interleaving significantly increases the cost of the device. Also, determining the interleaving distance (ID) required to avoid MCUs causing double errors is not trivial. Typically, accelerated radiation experiments with a limited number of particle hits are used. They provide a lower bound on the required ID, but larger MCUs may occur with a low probability. But even if the percentage of such large MCUs is very low, the impact on reliability can be significant. This article presents a technique to mitigate the effects of large MCUs that is, those that exceed the ID, on memory reliability. The proposed approach is able to correct most double errors caused by large MCUs by exploiting the locality of the errors within an MCU."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13237","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13237","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13238","fieldValue":"Lee, Hsien-Hsin S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13238","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a design methodology using two complementary techniques to address high-frequency inductive noise in the early design phase of a microprocessor. First, we propose a noise-aware floorplanning technique that uses microarchitectural profile information to create noise-aware floorplans. Second, we present the design of a dynamic inductive-noise controlling mechanism at the microarchitectural level, which limits the on-die current demand within predefined bounds, regardless of the native power and current characteristics of running applications. By dynamically monitoring the access patterns of microarchitectural modules, our mechanism can effectively limit simultaneous switching activity of close-by modules, thereby leveling voltage ringing at local power-pins. Compared to prior art, our di\/dt alleviation technique is the first that takes the processor's floorplan, as well as its power-pin distribution, into account to provide a finer-grained control with minimal performance degradation. Based on the evaluation results using 2D floorplans, we show that our techniques can significantly improve inductive noise induced by current demand variation and reduce the average current variability by up to 7 times, with an average performance overhead of 4.0&percnt;. In addition, our floorplan reduces the noise margin violations using our noise-aware floorplan by an average of 56.3&percnt; while reducing the decap budget by 28&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13238","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13238","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13239","fieldValue":"Yan, Jin-Tai"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13239","fieldValue":" Given a set of IO buffers and a set of bump balls with the capacity constraints between two adjacent bump balls, based on the construction of the Delaunary triangulation and a Manhattan Voronoi diagram, an $O(n^2) assignment algorithm is proposed to assign all the IO connections in a single redistribution layer for IO connection assignment, where n is the number of bump balls in a flip-chip design. Furthermore, based on the computation of the probabilistic congestion for the assigned IO connections, an O(n2$) routing algorithm is proposed to minimize the total wirelength to route all the assigned IO connections while satisfying the capacity constraints for single-layer RDL routing. Compared with the combination of a greedy IO assignment and our RDL routing, our IO assignment reduces the total wirelength by 9.9&percnt; and improves the routability by 8.8&percnt; on the average for 6 tested circuits. Compared with the combination of a greedy IO assignment, the single-layer BGA global router [Tomioka and Takahashi 2006] and our RDL detailed routing, our IO connection assignment and RDL routing reduces the total wirelength by 12.9&percnt; and improve the routability by 10.2&percnt; on the average for 6 tested circuits.
