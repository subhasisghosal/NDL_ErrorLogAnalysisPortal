Embracing the viewpoint of surfaces from circles, we characterize discrete conformality for such meshes, in which the invariants are circles, cross-ratios, and mutual intersection angles. Such transformations are important in practice for editing meshes without distortions or loss of details. In addition, they are of substantial theoretical interest in discrete differential geometry. Our framework allows for handle-based deformations, and interpolation between given meshes with controlled conformal error."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17303","fieldValue":"M&ouml;bius transformations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17304","fieldValue":" Conformal deformations are infinitesimal scale-rotations, which can be parameterized by quaternions. The condition that such a quaternion field gives rise to a conformal deformation is nonlinear and in any case only admits Möbius transformations as solutions. We propose a particular decoupling of scaling and rotation which allows us to find near to conformal deformations as minimizers of a quadratic, convex Dirichlet energy. Applied to tetrahedral meshes we find deformations with low quasiconformal distortion as the principal eigenvector of a (quaternionic) Laplace matrix. The resulting algorithms can be implemented with highly optimized standard linear algebra libraries and yield deformations comparable in quality to far more expensive approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17304","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17304","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17305","fieldValue":" We propose a method to design linear deformation subspaces, unifying linear blend skinning and generalized barycentric coordinates. Deformation subspaces cut down the time complexity of variational shape deformation methods and physics-based animation (reduced-order physics). Our subspaces feature many desirable properties: interpolation, smoothness, shape-awareness, locality, and both constant and linear precision. We achieve these by minimizing a quadratic deformation energy, built via a discrete Laplacian inducing linear precision on the domain boundary. Our main advantage is speed: subspace bases are solutions to a sparse linear system, computed interactively even for generously tessellated domains. Users may seamlessly switch between applying transformations at handles and editing the subspace by adding, removing or relocating control handles. The combination of fast computation and good properties means that designing the right subspace is now just as creative as manipulating handles. This paradigm shift in handle-based deformation opens new opportunities to explore the space of shape deformations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17305","fieldValue":"ACM"}
