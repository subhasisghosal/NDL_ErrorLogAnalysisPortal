While most codes rely on explicit formulae for these basis functions, we present a new approach that allows us to construct a general class of finite element basis functions from orthonormal polynomials and evaluate and differentiate them at any points. This approach relies on fundamental ideas from linear algebra and is implemented in Python using several object-oriented and functional programming techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19077","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19077","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19078","fieldValue":"Gonzlez--Pinto, S."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19078","fieldValue":"Prez--Rodrguez, S."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19078","fieldValue":" This paper is concerned with local error estimation in the numerical integration of stiff systems of ordinary differential equations by means of Runge--Kutta methods. With implicit Runge--Kutta methods it is often difficult to embed a local error estimate with the appropriate order and stability properties. In this paper local error estimation based on the information from the last two integration steps (that are supposed to have the same steplength) is proposed. It is shown that this technique, applied to Radau IIA methods, lets us get estimators with proper order and stability properties. Numerical examples showing that the proposed estimate improves the efficiency of the integration codes are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19078","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19078","fieldValue":"ACM"}
