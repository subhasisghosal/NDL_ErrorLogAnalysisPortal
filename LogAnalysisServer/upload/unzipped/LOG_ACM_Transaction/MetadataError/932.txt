The risk has increased with the availability of flexible interactive evaluation programs which permit the use of trackers, the most dangerous class of snooping tools known. A class of trackers, called union trackers, is described. They permit reconstruction of the entire database without supplementary knowledge and include the general tracker recently described as a special case. For many real statistical databases the overwhelming majority of definable sets of records will form trackers. For such databases a random search for a tracker is likely to sì³®d rapidly. Individual trackers are redefined and counted and their cardinalities are investigated. If there are n records in the database, then most individual trackers employ innocent cardinalities near n\/3, making them difficult to detect. Disclosure with trackers usually requires little effort per retrieved data element."}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.ispartof","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_MULTIPLE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13875","fieldValue":"{\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13623\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, Dec  1980\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.ispartof","informationCode":"WARN_JSON_MINIFY","handle":"12345678_acm\/13875","fieldValue":"{\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/13623\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, Dec  1980\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13875","fieldValue":"ACM"}
