Earlier methods addressed two-cycle tests. The importance of multi-cycle tests results from the ability to produce more compact test sets than possible with two-cycle tests, from the fact that when multi-cycle tests are applied at-speed, they can detect defects that are not detected by two-cycle tests and from their ability to avoid overtesting of delay faults. The approach described in this article is based on holding the values of selected state variables constant during the functional clock cycles of a multi-cycle broadside test. This allows new tests to be produced, which are different from broadside tests, without relying on nonfunctional toggling of state variables as in earlier methods for two-cycle tests. Experimental results show significant improvements in transition fault coverage using a fixed set of hold configurations for two types of multi-cycle broadside test sets: (1) test sets that are stored and applied from an external tester, and (2) functional broadside test sets that are generated using on-chip hardware."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13376","fieldValue":"Blanton, R. D Shawn"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13376","fieldValue":" Stringent quality requirements for integrated, heterogeneous systems have led designers and test engineers to mandate large sets of tests to be applied to these systems, which, in turn, have resulted in increased test cost. However, many of these tests are unnecessary (i.e., redundant), since their outcomes can be reliably predicted using results from other applied tests. A methodology for identifying the redundant tests of an integrated, heterogeneous system that has only binary pass-fail test data is described. This methodology uses decision trees, Boolean minimization, and satisfiability as core components. Feasibility is empirically demonstrated using test data from two commercially fabricated systems, namely, a high-speed serializer\/deserializer (HSS) and a phase-locked loop (PLL). Our analysis of test data from > 38,000 HSS and > 22,000 PLL circuits show that 14 out of 40 HSS tests and 11 out of 36 PLL tests are redundant."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13377","fieldValue":"Chang, Da-Wei"}
