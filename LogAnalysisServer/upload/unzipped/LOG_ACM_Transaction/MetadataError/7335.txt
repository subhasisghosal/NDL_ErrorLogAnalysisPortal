The framework is illustrated for the case of a simple multipath-rich Rayleigh-fading channel model. Both unicasting (one source and one destination) and multicasting (one source and several destinations) scenarios are considered. We introduce a meaningful notion of Shannon capacity for such systems, evaluate this capacity as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and develop a simple two-phase cooperative network protocol that achieves it. We observe that the resulting capacity is the same for both unicasting and multicasting, but show that the network size required to achieve any target error probability is smaller for unicasting than for multicasting. Finally, we introduce the notion of a network \"scaling exponent\" to quantify the rate of decay of error probability with network size as a function of the targeted fraction of the capacity. This exponent provides additional insights to system designers by enabling a finer grain comparison of candidate cooperative transmission protocols in even moderately sized networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9484","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9484","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9484","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9484","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9485","fieldValue":" In this correspondence, we study the capacity region of a general wireless network by deriving fundamental upper bounds on a class of linear functionals of the rate tuples at which joint reliable communication can take place. The widely studied transport capacity is a specific linear functional: the coefficient of the rate between a pair of nodes is equal to the Euclidean distance between them. The upper bound on the linear functionals of the capacity region is used to derive upper bounds to scaling laws for generalized transport capacity: the coefficient of the rate between a pair of nodes is equal to some arbitrary function of the Euclidean distance between them, for a class of minimum distance networks. This upper bound to the scaling law meets that achievable by multihop communication over these networks for a wide class of channel conditions; this shows the optimality, in the scaling-law sense, of multihop communication when studying generalized transport capacity of wireless networks."}
