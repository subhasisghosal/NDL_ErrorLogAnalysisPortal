Therefore, the analysis of the mobility models proposed for these networks becomes crucial. The contribution of this paper is to provide an analytical framework that is generalized enough to perform the analysis of realistic random movement models over two-dimensional regions. The synthetic scenarios that can be captured include hotspots where mobiles accumulate with higher probability and spend more time, and take into consideration location and displacement dependent speed distributions. By the utilization of the framework to the random waypoint mobility model, we derive an approximation to the spatial distribution of terminals over rectangular regions. We validate the accuracy of this approximation via simulation, and by comparing the marginals with proven results for one-dimensional regions, we find out that the quality of the approximation is insensitive to the proportion between dimensions of the terrain."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9619","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9619","fieldValue":"Two-dimensional modeling and analysis of generalized random mobility models for wireless ad hoc networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9620","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a general hybrid systems framework to model the flow of traffic in communication networks. The proposed models use averaging to continuously approximate discrete variables such as congestion window and queue size. Because averaging occurs over short time intervals, discrete events such as the occurrence of a drop and the consequent reaction by congestion control can still be captured. This modeling framework, thus, fills a gap between purely packet-level and fluid-based models, faithfully capturing the dynamics of transient phenomena and yet providing significant flexibility in modeling various congestion control mechanisms, different queueing policies, multicast transmission, etc. The modeling framework is validated by comparing simulations of the hybrid models against packet-level simulations. It is shown that the probability density functions produced by the ns-2 network simulator match closely those obtained with hybrid models. Moreover, a complexity analysis supports the observation that in networks with large per-flow bandwidths, simulations using hybrid models require significantly less computational resources than ns-2 simulations. Tools developed to automate the generation and simulation of hybrid systems models are also presented. Their use is showcased in a study, which simulates TCP flows with different roundtrip times over the Abilene backbone."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9620","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9620","fieldValue":"TCP"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9620","fieldValue":"UDP"}
