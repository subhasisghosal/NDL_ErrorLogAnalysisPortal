The proposed system consists of two parts---feature extraction and emotion verification. In the first part, for each sound frame, important atoms from the Gabor dictionary are selected by using the matching pursuit algorithm. The scale, frequency, and magnitude of the atoms are extracted to construct a nonuniform scale-frequency map, which supports auditory discriminability by the analysis of critical bands. Next, sparse representation is used to transform scale-frequency maps into sparse coefficients to enhance the robustness against emotion variance and achieve error-tolerance improvement. In the second part, emotion verification, two scores are calculated. A novel sparse representation verification approach based on Gaussian-modeled residual errors is proposed to generate the first score from the sparse coefficients. Such a classifier can minimize emotion variance and improve recognition accuracy. The second score is calculated by using the emotional agreement index (EAI) from the same coefficients. These two scores are combined to obtain the final detection result. Experiments on an emotional database of spoken speech were conducted and indicate that the proposed approach can achieve an average equal error rate (EER) of as low as 6.61%. A comparison among different approaches reveals that the proposed method is superior to the others and confirms its feasibility."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3797","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3797","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3798","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose a robust and low-complexity acoustic source localization technique based on time differences of arrival (TDOA), which addresses the scenario of distributed sensor networks in 3D environments. Network nodes are assumed to be unsynchronized, i.e., TDOAs between microphones belonging to different nodes are not available. We begin with showing how to select feasible TDOAs for each sensor node, exploiting both geometrical considerations and a characterization of the overall generalized cross correlation (GCC) shape. We then show how to localize sources in the space-range reference frame, where TDOA measurements have a clear geometrical interpretation that can be fruitfully used in the scenario of unsynchronized sensors. In this framework, in fact, the source corresponds to the apex of a hypercone passing through points described by the sole microphone positions and TDOA measurements. The localization problem is therefore approached as a hypercone fitting problem. Finally, in order to improve the robustness of the estimate, we include an outlier detection procedure based on the evaluation of the hypercone fitting residuals. A refinement of source location estimate is then performed ignoring the contributions coming from outlier measurements. A set of simulations shows the performance of individual blocks of the system, with particular focus on the effect of TDOA selection on source localization and refinement steps. Experiments on real data validate the localization algorithm in an everyday scenario, proving that good accuracy can be obtained while saving computational cost in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3798","fieldValue":"A robust and low-complexity source localization algorithm for asynchronous distributed microphone networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3798","fieldValue":"ACM"}
