In this situation, there always exists a topological sorting of the 3D-rectangles based on the relation of occlusion (a dominance relation). The arising total order is used to generate the axial view, where the two-dimensional view of each 3D-rectangle is incrementally added, starting from the closest 3D-rectangle. The proposed scene-sensitive algorithm runs in time O(N log2N + d log N), where N is the number of 3D-rectangles and d is the number of edges of the display. This improves over the previously best known technique based on the same approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15036","fieldValue":" Quartic Beta-splines have third-degree arc-length or geometric continuity at simple knots and are determined by three Î² or shape parameters. We present a general explicit formula for quartic Beta-splines, and determine and illustrate the effects of varying the Î² parameters on the shape of a quartic Beta-spline curve. We show that quartic (and higher degree) rational Beta-splines with arc-length continuity satisfy the same continuity conditions as (nonrational) Beta-splines. We also show that the torsion continuous spline curves presented by Boehm (\"Smooth Curves and Surfaces.â\u20AC? In Geometric Modeling: Algorithms and New Trends, G. E. Farin, Ed. SIAM, Philadelphia, Pa., 1987, pp. 175-184.) are equivalent to nonrational quartic Beta-spline curves, and determine the relationship between the shape parameters for the two types of curves. Finally, we present an algorithm for inserting a new knot and determining the refined control polygon."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15036","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15036","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15037","fieldValue":" To print image data optimized for display on a color monitor, the red, green, and blue values that drive the display must be transformed into data that control the amounts of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black on the print. The differences in the way display and print images are produced have important consequences for the transformation. Matching the appearance of the monitor and print images may be impossible, and achieving satisfactory results is complex. A method for obtaining pleasing prints from display image data is presented. This method assumes that good results can be achieved by users who do not have extensive knowledge of color reproduction and who have a minimum of color measuring equipment available."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15037","fieldValue":"ACM"}
