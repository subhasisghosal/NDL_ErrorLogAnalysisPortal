Designing a feasible primer pair is an important work before performing PCR-RFLP for SNP genotyping. However, in many cases, restriction enzymes to discriminate the target SNP resulting in the primer design is not applicable. A mutagenic primer is introduced to solve this problem. GA-based Mismatch PCR-RFLP Primers Design (GAMPD) provides a method that uses a genetic algorithm to search for optimal mutagenic primers and available restriction enzymes from REBASE. In order to improve the efficiency of the proposed method, a mutagenic matrix is employed to judge whether a hypothetical mutagenic primer can discriminate the target SNP by digestion with available restriction enzymes. The available restriction enzymes for the target SNP are mined by the updated core of SNP-RFLPing. GAMPD has been used to simulate the SNPs in the human SLC6A4 gene under different parameter settings and compared with SNP Cutter for mismatch PCR-RFLP primer design. The in silico simulation of the proposed GAMPD program showed that it designs mismatch PCR-RFLP primers. The GAMPD program is implemented in JAVA and is freely available at http:\/\/bio.kuas.edu.tw\/gampd\/"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4766","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4766","fieldValue":"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), mutagenic primer design, genetic algorithm (GA)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4767","fieldValue":"OLaighin, Gearoid"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4767","fieldValue":" Biological cell cryopreservation permits storage of specimens for future use. Stem cell cryostorage in particular is fast becoming a broadly spread practice due to their potential for use in regenerative medicine. For the optimal cryopreservation process, ultralow temperatures are needed. However, elevated temperatures are often unavoidable in a typical sample handling cycle which in turn negatively affects the postcryopreservation integrity of cells. In this paper, we present an application of active learning using an underlying Gaussian Process (GP) model in an experimental study on postcryopreservation membrane integrity response to a range of elevated temperature conditions. We tailored this technique for the current investigation and developed an algorithm which enabled identification of the sampling locations for the experiments in order to obtain the highest information return about the process from a limited size sample set. We applied this algorithm in the experimental study investigating the effects of severe temperature elevation (ranging from -40 to 20^{\\circ }{\\rm C}) over a short term event (48 hours) on the postcryopreservation membrane integrity of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) derived from human bone marrow. The algorithm showed excellent performance by selecting the locations which maximized the reduction of variance of the process response estimate. An approximating GP model developed from this experimental data shows that the elevated temperatures during cryopreservation have an imminent detrimental effect on cell integrity."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4767","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4767","fieldValue":"Active learning, Gaussian process, postcryopreservation cell integrity, stem cells, temperature elevation."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4767","fieldValue":"On the Application of Active Learning and Gaussian Processes in Postcryopreservation Cell Membrane Integrity Experiments"}
