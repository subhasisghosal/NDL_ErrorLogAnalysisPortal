The classification reflects the structural, evolutionary, and functional relatedness. These relationships are embodied in a hierarchical classification, such as the Structural Classification of Protein (SCOP), which is mostly manually curated. Such a classification is essential for the structural and functional analyses of proteins. Yet a large number of proteins remain unclassified. In this study, we have proposed an unsupervised machine learning approach to classify and assign a given set of proteins to SCOP superfamilies. In the method, we have constructed a database and similarity matrix using P-values obtained from an all-against-all BLAST run and trained the network with the ART2 unsupervised learning algorithm using the rows of the similarity matrix as input vectors, enabling the trained network to classify the proteins from 0.82 to 0.97 f-measure accuracy. The performance of ART2 has been compared with that of spectral clustering, Random forest, SVM, and HHpred. ART2 performs better than the others except HHpred. HHpred performs better than ART2 and the sum of errors is smaller than that of the other methods evaluated."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4744","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1404","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1404","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4745","fieldValue":" Computational methods for predicting protein subcellular localization have used various types of features, including N-terminal sorting signals, amino acid compositions, and text annotations from protein databases. Our approach does not use biological knowledge such as the sorting signals or homologues, but use just protein sequence information. The method divides a protein sequence into short k-mer sequence fragments which can be mapped to word features in document classification. A large number of class association rules are mined from the protein sequence examples that range from the N-terminus to the C-terminus. Then, a boosting algorithm is applied to those rules to build up a final classifier. Experimental results using benchmark data sets show that our method is excellent in terms of both the classification performance and the test coverage. The result also implies that the k-mer sequence features which determine subcellular locations do not necessarily exist in specific positions of a protein sequence.
