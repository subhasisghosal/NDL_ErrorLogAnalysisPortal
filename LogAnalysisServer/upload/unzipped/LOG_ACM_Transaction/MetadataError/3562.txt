For these applications, sensor localization is one of the most fundamental challenges. Different from a traditional sensor node, a wireless rechargeable sensor has to be charged above a voltage level by the wireless charger in order to support its sensing, computation, and communication operations. In this work, we consider the scenario where a mobile charger stops at different positions to charge sensors and propose a novel localization design that utilizes the unique Time of Charge (TOC) sequences among wireless rechargeable sensors. Specifically, we introduce two efficient region dividing methods, Internode Division and Interarea Division, to exploit TOC differences from both temporal and spatial dimensions to localize individual sensor nodes. To further optimize the system performance, we introduce both an optimal charger stop planning algorithm for the single-sensor case and a suboptimal charger stop planning algorithm for the generic multisensor scenario with a provable performance bound. We have extensively evaluated our design by both testbed experiments and large-scale simulations. The experiment and simulation results show that by as less as five stops, our design can achieve sub-meter accuracy and the performance is robust under various system conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21576","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21576","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21577","fieldValue":"Vasilakos, Athanasios V"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21577","fieldValue":" Energy efficiency is one of the key objectives in data gathering in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Recent research on energy-efficient data gathering in WSNs has explored the use of Compressive Sensing (CS) to parsimoniously represent the data. However, the performance of CS-based data gathering methods has been limited since the approaches failed to take advantage of judicious network configurations and effective CS-based data aggregation procedures. In this article, a novel Hierarchical Data Aggregation method using Compressive Sensing (HDACS) is presented, which combines a hierarchical network configuration with CS. Our key idea is to set multiple compression thresholds adaptively based on cluster sizes at different levels of the data aggregation tree to optimize the amount of data transmitted. The advantages of the proposed model in terms of the total amount of data transmitted and data compression ratio are analytically verified. Moreover, we formulate a new energy model by factoring in both processor and radio energy consumption into the cost, especially the computation cost incurred in relatively complex algorithms. We also show that communication cost remains dominant in data aggregation in the practical applications of large-scale networks. We use both the real-world data and synthetic datasets to test CS-based data aggregation schemes on the SIDnet-SWANS simulation platform. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HDACS model guarantees accurate signal recovery performance. It also provides substantial energy savings compared with existing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21577","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21577","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21578","fieldValue":"Lambrou, Theofanis P"}
