{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19373","fieldValue":" The QR algorithm is the method of choice for computing all eigenvalues of a dense nonsymmetric matrix A. After an initial reduction to Hessenberg form, a QR iteration can be viewed as chasing a small bulge from the top left to the bottom right corner along the subdiagonal of A. To increase data locality and create potential for parallelism, modern variants of the QR algorithm perform several iterations simultaneously, which amounts to chasing a chain of several bulges instead of a single bulge. To make effective use of level 3 BLAS, it is important to pack these bulges as tightly as possible within the chain. In this work, we show that the tightness of the packing in existing approaches is not optimal and can be increased. This directly translates into a reduced chain length by 33&percnt; compared to the state-of-the-art LAPACK implementation of the QR algorithm. To demonstrate the impact of our idea, we have modified the LAPACK implementation to make use of the optimal packing. Numerical experiments reveal a uniform reduction of the execution time, without affecting stability or robustness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19373","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19374","fieldValue":" In the context of large-scale eigenvalue problems, methods of Davidson type such as Jacobi-Davidson can be competitive with respect to other types of algorithms, especially in some particularly difficult situations such as computing interior eigenvalues or when matrix factorization is prohibitive or highly inefficient. However, these types of methods are not generally available in the form of high-quality parallel implementations, especially for the case of non-Hermitian eigenproblems. We present our implementation of various Davidson-type methods in SLEPc, the Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations. The solvers incorporate many algorithmic variants for subspace expansion and extraction, and cover a wide range of eigenproblems including standard and generalized, Hermitian and non-Hermitian, with either real or complex arithmetic. We provide performance results on a large battery of test problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19375","fieldValue":"Ratnanather, J Tilak"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19375","fieldValue":"Kim, Jung H"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19375","fieldValue":"Davis, Anthony M J"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19375","fieldValue":"Lucas, Stephen K"}
