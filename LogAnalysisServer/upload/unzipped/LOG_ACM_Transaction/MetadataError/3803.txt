Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a mathematical model that is used to understand document semantics by deriving a semantic structure based on patterns of word correlations in the document. When using LSA to capture semantics from summaries, it is observed that LSA performs quite well despite being completely independent of any external sources of semantics. However, LSA can be remodeled to enhance its capability to analyze correlations within texts. By taking advantage of the model being language independent, this article presents two stages of LSA remodeling to understand document semantics in the Indian context, specifically from Hindi text summaries. One stage of remodeling is done by providing supplementary information, such as document category and domain information. The second stage of remodeling is done by using a supervised term weighting measure in the process. The remodeled LSAâ\u20AC™s performance is empirically evaluated in a document classification application by comparing the accuracies of classification to plain LSA. An improvement in the performance of LSA in the range of 4.7% to 6.2% is achieved from the remodel when compared to the plain model. The results suggest that summaries of documents efficiently capture the semantic structure of documents and is an alternative to full-length documents for understanding document semantics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3123","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3123","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22256","fieldValue":"apkun, Srdjan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22256","fieldValue":" Secure bootstrapping of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is a challenging problem in scenarios in which network users (or nodes) do not share trust relationships prior to the network deployment. In recent years, a number of schemes have been proposed to solve this problem, assuming either no or limited trust between the nodes prior to their deployment. Despite numerous proposals, there is no common understanding of the proposed schemes and of the trade-offs that they provide. This has consequences for both researchers and practitioners, who do not have a clear idea how to compare the schemes and how to select a scheme for a given application. In this article, we present a framework that helps in understanding and comparing schemes for secure bootstrapping of MANETs. The framework is general because it is policy-neutral and can accommodate many existing bootstrapping schemes. The proposed framework can equally serve as a good basis for the development of new MANET bootstrapping schemes; we show how the development of the framework leads to two new (classes of) distributed bootstrapping schemes. Within the framework, we not only investigate and characterize the properties of the relevant bootstrapping schemes, but also give methods for practitioners to select the relevant system parameters in the Random Walk and the (Restricted) Random Waypoint mobility models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22256","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22257","fieldValue":"ONeill, Adam"}
