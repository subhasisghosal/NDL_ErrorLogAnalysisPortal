In order for users to effectively access these collections, information retrieval (IR) systems must provide coordinated, concurrent, and distributed access. In this article, we explore how to achieve scalable performance in a distributed system for collection sizes ranging from 1GB to 128GB. We implement a fully functional distributed IR system based on a multithreaded version of the Inquery simulation model. We measure performance as a function of system parameters such as client command rate, number of document collections, ter ms per query, query term frequency, number of answers returned, and command mixture. Our results show that it is important to model both query and document commands because the heterogeneity of commands significantly impacts performance. Based on our results, we recommend simple changes to the prototype and evaluate the changes using the simulator. Because of the significant resource demands of information retrieval, it is not difficult to generate workloads that overwhelm system resources regardless of the architecture. However under some realistic workloads, we demonstrate system organizations for which response time gracefully degrades as the workload increases and performance scales with the number of processors. This scalable architecture includes a surprisingly small number of brokers through which a large number of clients and servers communicate."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23815","fieldValue":"Evaluating the performance of distributed architectures for information retrieval using a variety of workloads"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23815","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23815","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23816","fieldValue":"Clarke, Charles L A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23816","fieldValue":" We present a model for arbitrary passage retrieval using Boolean queries. The model is applied to the task of ranking documents, or other structural elements, in the order of their expected relevance. Features such as phrase matching, truncation, and stemming integrate naturally into the model. Properties of Boolean algebra are obeyed, and the exact-match semantics of Boolean retrieval are preserved. Simple inverted-list file structures provide an efficient implementation. Retrieval effectiveness is comparable to that of standard ranking techniques. Since global statistics are not used, the method is of particular value in distributed environments. Since ranking is based on arbitrary passages, the structural elements to be ranked may be specified at query time and do not need to be restricted to predefined elements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23816","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23816","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23817","fieldValue":" Techniques for automatic query expansion have been extensively studied in information research as a means of addressing the word mismatch between queries and documents. These techniques can be categorized as either global or local. While global techniques rely on analysis of a whole collection to discover word relationships, local techniques emphasize analysis of the top-ranked documents retrieved for a query. While local techniques have shown to be more effective that global techniques in general, existing local techniques are not robust and can seriously hurt retrieved when few of the retrieval documents are relevant. We propose a new technique, called local context analysis, which selects expansion terms based on cooccurrence with the query terms within the top-ranked documents. Experiments on a number of collections, both English and non-English, show that local context analysis offers more effective and consistent retrieval results. "}
