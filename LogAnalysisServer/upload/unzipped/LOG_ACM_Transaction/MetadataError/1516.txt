The main idea of our technique is to precompute for each scene entity a shadow field that describes the shadowing effects of the entity at points around it. The shadow field for a light source, called a source radiance field (SRF), records radiance from an illuminant as cube maps at sampled points in its surrounding space. For an occluder, an object occlusion field (OOF) conversely represents in a similar manner the occlusion of radiance by an object. A fundamental difference between shadow fields and previous shadow computation concepts is that shadow fields can be precomputed independent of scene configuration. This is critical for dynamic scenes because, at any given instant, the shadow information at any receiver point can be rapidly computed as a simple combination of SRFs and OOFs according to the current scene configuration. Applications that particularly benefit from this technique include large dynamic scenes in which many instances of an entity can share a single shadow field. Our technique enables low-frequency shadowing effects in dynamic scenes in real-time and all-frequency shadows at interactive rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15613","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15613","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15614","fieldValue":" We present a technique, based on precomputed light transport, for interactive rendering of translucent objects under all-frequency environment maps. We consider the complete BSSRDF model proposed by Jensen et al. [2001]. which includes both single and diffuse multiple scattering components. The challenge is how to efficiently precompute all-frequency light transport functions due to subsurface scattering. We apply the two-pass hierarchical technique by Jensen et al. [2002] in the space of non-linearly approximated transport vectors, which allows us to efficiently evaluate transport vectors due to diffuse multiple scattering. We then include an approximated single scattering term in the precomputation, which previous interactive systems have ignored. For an isotropic phase function, this approximation produces a diffuse transport vector per vertex, and is combined with the multiple scattering component. For a general phase function, we introduce a technique from BRDF rendering to factor the phase function using a separable decomposition to allow for view-dependent rendering. We show that our rendering results qualitatively match the appearance of translucent objects, achieving a high level of realism at interactive rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15614","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15614","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15615","fieldValue":"Akenine-Mller, Tomas"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15615","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a new method for real-time relighting of scenes illuminated by local light sources. We extend previous work on precomputed radiance transfer for distant lighting to local lighting by introducing the concept of unstructured light clouds. The unstructured light cloud enables a compact representation of local lights in the model and real-time rendering of complex models with full global illumination due to local light sources. We use simplification of lights, and clustered PCA to obtain a compressed representation. When storing only the indirect component of the illumination, we are able to get high quality with only 8-16 lighting coefficients per vertex. Our results demonstrate real-time rendering of scenes with moving lights, dynamic cameras, glossy materials and global illumination."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15615","fieldValue":"ACM"}
