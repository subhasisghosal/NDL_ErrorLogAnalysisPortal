A vague query establishes a target qualification and is concerned also with data that are close to this target. Most conventional database systems cannot handle vague queries directly, forcing their users to retry specific queries repeatedly with minor modifications until they match data that are satisfactory. This article describes a system called VAGUE that can handle vague queries directly. The principal concept behind VAGUE is its extension to the relational data model with data metrics, which are definitions of distances between values of the same domain. A problem with implementing data distances is that different users may have different interpretations for the notion of distance. VAGUE incorporates several features that enable it to adapt itself to the individual views and priorities of its users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23629","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23629","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23630","fieldValue":" Two tools that support cooperation are described: one for the construction of consistent and principled human-computer interfaces and the other for the construction of AI knowledge bases. These tools provide a central repository for design knowledge that otherwise would not be easily shared among users. The AI knowledge representation technology upon which the tools are founded is first described. A knowledge-based approach to interface construction is discussed, and how that approach applies to detecting design conflicts and inconsistencies stemming from two different kinds of team communication failure is illustrated. Next, a knowledge acquisition aid that is utilized within the interface construction paradigm and that also illustrates the same approach to supporting cooperative work is described. Finally, four sources of difficulty in team design efforts, which this approach seeks to address, are reviewed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23630","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23630","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23631","fieldValue":" Much computerized support for knowledge workers has consisted of tools to handle low-level functions such as distribution, storage, and retrieval of information. However, the higher level processes of making decisions and taking actions with respect to this information have not been supported to the same degree. This paper describes the ISCREEN prototype system for screening text messages. ISCREEN includes a high-level interface for users to define rules, a component that screens text messages, and a conflict detection component that examines rules for inconsistencies. An explanation component uses text generation to answer user queries about past or potential system actions based on Grice's conversational maxims."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23631","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23631","fieldValue":"ACM"}
