{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24097","fieldValue":" Traditionally, in many probabilistic retrieval models, query terms are assumed to be independent. Although such models can achieve reasonably good performance, associations can exist among terms from a human beingâ\u20AC™s point of view. There are some recent studies that investigate how to model term associations\/dependencies by proximity measures. However, the modeling of term associations theoretically under the probabilistic retrieval framework is still largely unexplored. In this article, we introduce a new concept cross term, to model term proximity, with the aim of boosting retrieval performance. With cross terms, the association of multiple query terms can be modeled in the same way as a simple unigram term. In particular, an occurrence of a query term is assumed to have an impact on its neighboring text. The degree of the query-term impact gradually weakens with increasing distance from the place of occurrence. We use shape functions to characterize such impacts. Based on this assumption, we first propose a bigram CRoss TErm Retrieval $(CRTER_2) model as the basis model, and then recursively propose a generalized n-gram CRoss TErm Retrieval (CRTERn$) model for n query terms, where n > 2. Specifically, a bigram cross term occurs when the corresponding query terms appear close to each other, and its impact can be modeled by the intersection of the respective shape functions of the query terms. For an n-gram cross term, we develop several distance metrics with different properties and employ them in the proposed models for ranking. We also show how to extend the language model using the newly proposed cross terms. Extensive experiments on a number of TREC collections demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24097","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24097","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24098","fieldValue":"Liu, Shao-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24098","fieldValue":"Zhu, Wen-Wu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24098","fieldValue":"Luan, Huan-Bo"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24098","fieldValue":"Chua, Tat-Seng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24098","fieldValue":"Yang, Shi-Qiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24098","fieldValue":" Although Web search techniques have greatly facilitate usersâ\u20AC™ information seeking, there are still quite a lot of search sessions that cannot provide satisfactory results, which are more serious in Web image search scenarios. How to understand user intent from observed data is a fundamental issue and of paramount significance in improving image search performance. Previous research efforts mostly focus on discovering user intent either from clickthrough behavior in user search logs (e.g., Google), or from social data to facilitate vertical image search in a few limited social media platforms (e.g., Flickr). This article aims to combine the virtues of these two information sources to complement each other, that is, sensing and understanding usersâ\u20AC™ interests from social media platforms and transferring this knowledge to rerank the image search results in general image search engines. Toward this goal, we first propose a novel social-sensed image search framework, where both social media and search engine are jointly considered. To effectively and efficiently leverage these two kinds of platforms, we propose an example-based user interest representation and modeling method, where we construct a hybrid graph from social media and propose a hybrid random-walk algorithm to derive the user-image interest graph. Moreover, we propose a social-sensed image reranking method to integrate the user-image interest graph from social media and search results from general image search engines to rerank the images by fusing their social relevance and visual relevance. We conducted extensive experiments on real-world data from Flickr and Google image search, and the results demonstrated that the proposed methods can significantly improve the social relevance of image search results while maintaining visual relevance well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24098","fieldValue":"ACM"}
