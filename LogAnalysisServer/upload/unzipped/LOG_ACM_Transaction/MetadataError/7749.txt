{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10309","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present a new routing paradigm that generalizes opportunistic routing for wireless multihop networks. In multirate anypath routing, each node uses both a set of next-hops and a selected transmission rate to reach a destination. Using this rate, a packet is broadcast to the nodes in the set, and one of them forwards the packet on to the destination. To date, there is no theory capable of jointly optimizing both the set of next-hops and the transmission rate used by each node. We solve this by introducing two polynomial-time routing algorithms and provide the proof of their optimality. The proposed algorithms have roughly the same running time as regular shortest-path algorithms and are therefore suitable for deployment in routing protocols. We conducted measurements in an 802.11b testbed network, and our trace-driven analysis shows that multirate anypath routing is on average 80% better than 11-Mbps anypath routing, with a factor of 6.4 improvement in the best case. If the rate is fixed at 1 Mbps instead, performance improves by a factor of 5.4 on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10309","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10310","fieldValue":" In this paper, we establish that the rate region of a large class of IEEE 802.11 mesh networks is log-convex, immediately allowing standard utility fairness methods to be generalized to this class of networks. This creates a solid theoretical underpinning for fairness analysis and resource allocation in this practically important class of networks. For the special case of max-min fairness, we use this new insight to obtain an almost complete characterization of the fair rate allocation and a remarkably simple, practically implementable method for achieving max-min fairness in 802.11 mesh networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10310","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10310","fieldValue":"TXOP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10310","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10310","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10311","fieldValue":" This paper presents DAWN, a declarative platform that creates highly adaptive policy-based mobile ad hoc network (MANET) protocols. DAWN leverages declarative networking techniques to achieve extensible routing and forwarding using declarative languages. We make the following contributions. First, we demonstrate that traditional MANET protocols can be expressed in a concise fashion as declarative networks and policy-driven adaptation can be specified in the same language to dictate the dynamic selection of different protocols based on various network and traffic conditions. Second, we propose interprotocol forwarding techniques that ensure packets are able to seamlessly traverse across clusters of nodes running different protocols selected based on their respective policies. Third, we have developed a full-fledged implementation of DAWN using the RapidNet declarative networking system. We experimentally validate a variety of policy-based adaptive MANETs in various dynamic settings using a combination of ns-3 simulations and deployment on the ORBIT testbed. Our experimental results demonstrate that hybrid protocols developed using DAWN outperform traditional MANET routing protocols and are able to flexibly and dynamically adapt their routing mechanisms to achieve a good tradeoff between bandwidth utilization and route quality. We further demonstrate DAWN's capabilities to achieve interprotocol forwarding across different protocols."}
