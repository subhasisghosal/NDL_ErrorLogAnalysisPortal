The key idea is to divide the FFT spectrum into short frames and change the magnitude of the selected FFT samples using Fibonacci numbers. Taking advantage of Fibonacci numbers, it is possible to change the frequency samples adaptively. In fact, the suggested technique guarantees and proves, mathematically, that the maximum change is less than 61% of the related FFT sample and the average error for each sample is 25%. Using the closest Fibonacci number to FFT magnitudes results in a robust and transparent technique. On top of very remarkable capacity, transparency and robustness, this scheme provides two parameters which facilitate the regulation of these properties. The experimental results show that the method has a high capacity (700 bps to 3 kbps), without significant perceptual distortion (ODG is about 1) and provides robustness against common audio signal processing such as echo, added noise, filtering, and MPEG compression (MP3). In addition to the experimental results, the fidelity of suggested system is proved mathematically."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3952","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present an overview on the previous and recent methods proposed to estimate a clean spectral phase from a noisy observation in the context of single-channel speech enhancement. The importance of phase estimation in speech enhancement is inspired by the recent reports on its usefulness in finding a phase-sensitive amplitude estimation. We present a comparative study of the recent phase estimation methods and elaborate their limits. We propose a new phase enhancement method relying on phase decomposition and time-frequency smoothing filters. We demonstrate that the proposed time-frequency phase smoothing method successfully reduces the variance of the noisy phase at harmonics. Our results on different speech and noise databases and different signal-to-noise ratios show that in contrast to the existing benchmark methods only the proposed method balances a tradeoff between a joint improvement in perceived quality of 0.2 in PESQ score and speech intelligibility of 2% by phase-only enhancement."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3953","fieldValue":"De Mori, Renato"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3953","fieldValue":" Mapping text documents in an LDA-based topic-space is a classical way to extract high-level representation of text documents. Unfortunately, LDA is highly sensitive to hyper-parameters related to the number of classes, or word and topic distribution, and there is no systematic way to pre-estimate optimal configurations. Moreover, various hyper-parameter configurations offer complementary views on the document. In this paper, we propose a method based on a two-step process that, first, expands the representation space by using a set of topic spaces and, second, compacts the representation space by removing poorly relevant dimensions. These two steps are based respectively on multi-view LDA-based representation spaces and factor-analysis models. This model provides a view-independent representation of documents while extracting complementary information from a massive multi-view representation. Experiments are conducted on the DECODA conversation corpus and the Reuters-21578 textual dataset. Results show the efficiency of the proposed multiview compact representation paradigm. The proposed categorization system reaches an accuracy of 86.5% with automatic transcriptions of conversations from DECODA corpus and a Macro-F1 of 80% during a classification task of the well-known Reuters-21578 corpus, with a significant gain compared to the baseline (best single topic space configuration), as well as methods and document representations previously studied."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3953","fieldValue":"ACM"}
