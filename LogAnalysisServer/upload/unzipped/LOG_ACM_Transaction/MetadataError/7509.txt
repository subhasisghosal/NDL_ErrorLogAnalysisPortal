{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9826","fieldValue":" Ethernet's high performance, low cost, and ubiquity have made it the dominant networking technology for many application domains. Unfortunately, its distributed forwarding topology computation protocol-the Rapid Spanning Tree Pro-tocol (RSTP)-is known to suffer from a classic count-to-infinity problem. However, the cause and implications of this problem are neither documented nor understood. This paper has three main contributions. First, we identify the exact conditions under which the count-to-infinity problem manifests itself, and we characterize its effect on forwarding topology convergence. Second, we have discovered that a forwarding loop can form during count to infinity, and we provide a detailed explanation. Third, we propose a simple and effective solution called RSTP with Epochs. This solution guarantees that the forwarding topology converges in at most one round-trip time across the network and eliminates the possibility of a count-to-infinity induced forwarding loop."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9826","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9826","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9826","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9827","fieldValue":" Geocasting in wireless sensor and ad hoc networks means delivering a message from a source node to all the nodes in a given geographical region. The objectives of a geocasting protocol are two-fold: guaranteed message delivery and low transmission cost. Most of the existing protocols do not guarantee message de-livery, and those that do, incur high transmission costs. In this study, we propose the concept of Virtual Surrounding Face (VSF), and design a VSF-based geocasting protocol (VSFG). We also design a SKIP method and a local dominating set (DS) based restricted flooding technique to further reduce the cost of VSFG. Through mathematical analysis and comprehensive sim-ulations, we show that VSFG, together with SKIP and local DS based restricted flooding, guarantees message delivery and has a much lower transmission cost than the previous approaches. The reduction of cost can be up to 65% compared with the most effi-cient existing approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9827","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9827","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9827","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9828","fieldValue":" Multi-path transport is an important mechanism for supporting video communications in multihop wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the joint problem of optimal path se-lection and rate allocation for multiple video sessions in a wire-less mesh network. We present a mathematical formulation to op-timize the application level performance (i.e., video distortion) in the context of path selection and rate allocation. For this complex optimization problem, we propose a branch-and-bound based so-lution procedure, embedded with the Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) that can produce (1 - Î\u2022)-optimal solutions for any small Î\u2022. This result is significant as it not only provides the-oretical understanding of this problem, but also offers a perfor-mance benchmark for any future proposed distributed algorithm and protocol for this problem. Simulation results are also provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the solution procedure."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9828","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
