We use a Gomory-Hu tree to represent all the pairwise min cuts implicitly. Previously, no subquadratic time algorithm was known for this problem. Since all-pairs min cut and the minimum-cycle basis are dual problems in planar graphs, we also obtain an implicit representation of a minimum-cycle basis in O(n log4 n) time and O(n log n) space. Additionally, an explicit representation can be obtained in O(C) time and space where C is the size of the basis. These results require that shortest paths are unique. This can be guaranteed either by using randomization without overhead or deterministically with an additional log2$ n factor in the preprocessing times."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2636","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2636","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17298","fieldValue":"de Goes, Fernando"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17298","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a new particle-based approach to incompressible fluid simulation. We depart from previous Lagrangian methods by considering fluid particles no longer purely as material points, but also as volumetric parcels that partition the fluid domain. The fluid motion is described as a time series of well-shaped power diagrams (hence the name power particles), offering evenly spaced particles and accurate pressure computations. As a result, we circumvent the typical excess damping arising from kernel-based evaluations of internal forces or density without having recourse to auxiliary Eulerian grids. The versatility of our solver is demonstrated by the simulation of multiphase flows and free surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17298","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: &#201;cole Polytechnique (Wallez, Corentin); Imperial College London (Pavlov, Dmitry); Caltech (de Goes, Fernando; Desbrun, Mathieu); Zhejiang U.
