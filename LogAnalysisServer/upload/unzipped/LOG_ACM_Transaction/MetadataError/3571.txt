We develop a scalable deterministic distributed algorithm for maintaining a Steiner tree of the agents so that group communication between them can be provided with the minimum total cost possible. The main idea is that our algorithm maintains a virtual tree of mobile agents that can be immediately converted to an actual Steiner tree at all times. Our algorithm achieves the Steiner tree with total length at most O(log k) times the length of the optimal Steiner tree in the constant-doubling graph model. The total communication cost (the number of messages) to maintain the Steiner tree is only O(min{log n, log D}) times the optimal communication cost, where n and D, respectively, are the number of nodes and the diameter of the constant-doubling network. We also develop improved algorithms for the mobile k-center, sparse-aggregation, and distributed-matching problems. Experimental evaluation results show the benefits of our algorithms compared to previous algorithms. These four problems are NP-hard and, to the best of our knowledge, our algorithms are the first near-optimal deterministic algorithms for maintaining approximate solutions to these important network problems with low maintenance costs in a distributed setting."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21601","fieldValue":"Van Steen, Maarten"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21601","fieldValue":" Energy is the scarcest resource in ad hoc wireless networks, particularly in wireless sensor networks requiring a long lifetime. Intermittently switching the radio on and off is widely adopted as the most effective way to keep energy consumption low. This, however, prevents the very goal of communication, unless nodes switch their radios on at synchronized intervalsâ\u20AC\u201Da rather nontrivial coordination task. In this article, we address the problem of synchronizing node radios to a single universal schedule in wireless mobile ad hoc networks that can potentially consist of thousands of nodes. More specifically, we are interested in operating the network with duty cycles that can be less than 1&percnt; of the total cycle time. We identify the fundamental issues that govern cluster merging and provide a detailed comparison of various policies using extensive simulations based on a variety of mobility patterns. We propose a specific scheme that allows a 4,000-node network to stay synchronized with a duty cycle of approximately 0.7&percnt;. Our work is based on an existing, experimental MAC protocol that we use for real-world applications and is validated in a real network of around 120 mobile nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21601","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21601","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21602","fieldValue":" Extensive empirical studies presented in this article confirm that the quality of radio communication between low-power sensor devices varies significantly with time and environment. This phenomenon indicates that the previous topology control solutions, which use static transmission power, transmission range, and link quality, might not be effective in the physical world. To address this issue, online transmission power control that adapts to external changes is necessary. This article presents ATPC, a lightweight algorithm for Adaptive Transmission Power Control in wireless sensor networks. In ATPC, each node builds a model for each of its neighbors, describing the correlation between transmission power and link quality. With this model, we employ a feedback-based transmission power control algorithm to dynamically maintain individual link quality over time. The intellectual contribution of this work lies in a novel pairwise transmission power control, which is significantly different from existing node-level or network-level power control methods. Also different from most existing simulation work, the ATPC design is guided by extensive field experiments of link quality dynamics at various locations over a long period of time. The results from the real-world experiments demonstrate that (1) with pairwise adjustment, ATPC achieves more energy savings with a finer tuning capability, and (2) with online control, ATPC is robust even with environmental changes over time."}
