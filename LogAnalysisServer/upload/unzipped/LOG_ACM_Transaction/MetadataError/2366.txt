While for none of these results a reverse reduction to Unique Games is known, the assumption of bijective projections in the Label Cover instance nevertheless seems critical in these proofs. In this work, we bypass the need for UGC assumption in inapproximability results for two geometric problems, obtaining a tight NP-hardness result in each case. The first problem, known as $L_p Subspace Approximation, is a generalization of the classic least squares regression problem. Here, the input consists of a set of points X &equals; {Î±1, â\u20AC¦ , Î±m} âŠ\u2020 Rn and a parameter k (possibly depending on n). The goal is to find a subspace H of Rn of dimension k that minimizes the &ell;p norm of the Euclidean distances to the points in X. For p &equals; 2, k &equals; n âˆ\u2019 1, this reduces to the least squares regression problem, while for p &equals; âˆž, k &equals; 0 it reduces to the problem of finding a ball of minimum radius enclosing all the points. We show that for any fixed p âˆˆ (2, âˆž), and for k &equals; n âˆ\u2019 1, it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within a factor of Î³p âˆ\u2019 &epsi; for constant &epsi; > 0, where Î³p is the pth norm of a standard Gaussian random variable. This matches the Î³p approximation algorithm obtained by Deshpande, Tulsiani, and Vishnoi who also showed the same hardness result under the UGC. The second problem we study is the related Lp Quadratic Grothendieck Maximization Problem, considered by Kindler, Naor, and Schechtman. Here, the input is a multilinear quadratic form âˆ\u2018ni, j &equals; 1aijxixj and the goal is to maximize the quadratic form over the &ell;p unit ball, namely, all x with âˆ\u2018ni &equals; 1&verbar;xi&verbar;p &les; 1. The problem is polynomial time solvable for p &equals; 2. We show that for any constant p âˆˆ (2, âˆž), it is NP-hard to approximate the quadratic form to within a factor of Î³2p âˆ\u2019 &epsi; for any &epsi; > 0. The same hardness factor was shown under the UGC by Kindler et al. We also obtain a Î³2p-approximation algorithm for the problem using the convex relaxation of the problem defined by Kindler et al. A Î³2p$ approximation algorithm has also been independently obtained by Naor and Schechtman. These are the first approximation thresholds, proven under P â\u2030  NP, that involve the Gaussian random variable in a fundamental way. Note that the problem statements themselves do not explicitly involve the Gaussian distribution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2680","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2680","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17771","fieldValue":" Low disk drive utilization suggests that placing the drive into a power saving mode during idle times may decrease power consumption. We present PREFiguRE, a robust framework that aims at harvesting future idle intervals for power savings while meeting strict quality constraints: first, it contains potential delays in serving IO requests that occur during power savings since the time to bring up the disk is not negligible, and second, it ensures that the power saving mechanism is triggered a few times only, such that the disk wear-out due to powering up and down does not compromise the diskâ\u20AC™s lifetime. PREFiguRE is based on an analytic methodology that uses the histogram of idle times to determine schedules for power saving modes as a function of the preceding constraints. PREFiguRE facilitates analysis for the evaluation of the trade-offs between power savings and quality targets for the current workload. Extensive experimentation on a set of enterprise storage traces illustrates PREFiguREâ\u20AC™s effectiveness to consistently achieve high power savings without undermining disk reliability and performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17771","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17771","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17772","fieldValue":" This work addresses the problem of estimating the distributions of packet flow sizes and durations under several methods of sampling packets. Two approaches, one based on inversion and the other on asymptotics, are considered. For the duration distribution, in particular, both approaches require modeling the structure of flows, with the duration distribution being characterized in terms of the IATs (interarrival times between packets) and size distributions of a flow. The inversion of the flow IAT distribution from sampled flow quantities, along with the inversion of the flow size distribution (already used in the literature) allows estimating the flow duration distribution. Motivated by the limitations of the inversion approach in estimating the distribution tails for some sampling methods, an asymptotic approach is developed to estimate directly the distribution tails of flow durations and sizes from sampled quantities. The adequacy of both approaches to estimate the flow distributions is checked against two real Internet traces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17772","fieldValue":"ACM"}
