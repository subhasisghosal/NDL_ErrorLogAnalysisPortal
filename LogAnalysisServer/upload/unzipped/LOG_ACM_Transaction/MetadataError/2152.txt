We accelerate alignment of the images by introducing a lightweight camera motion representation called homography flow. The aligned images are then fused to create a denoised output with rapid per-pixel operations in temporal and spatial domains. To handle scene motion during the capture, a mechanism of selecting consistent pixels for temporal fusion is proposed to \"synthesize\" a clean, ghost-free image, which can largely reduce the computation of tracking motion between frames. Combined with these efficient solutions, our method runs several orders of magnitude faster than previous work, while the denoising quality is comparable. A smartphone prototype demonstrates that our method is practical and works well on a large variety of real examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17235","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17235","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17236","fieldValue":" This paper proposes a novel compressive hyperspectral (HS) imaging approach that allows for high-resolution HS images to be captured in a single image. The proposed architecture comprises three key components: spatial-spectral encoded optical camera design, over-complete HS dictionary learning and sparse-constraint computational reconstruction. Our spatial-spectral encoded sampling scheme provides a higher degree of randomness in the measured projections than previous compressive HS imaging approaches; and a robust nonlinear sparse reconstruction method is employed to recover the HS images from the coded projection with higher performance. To exploit the sparsity constraint on the nature HS images for computational reconstruction, an over-complete HS dictionary is learned to represent the HS images in a sparser way than previous representations. We validate the proposed approach on both synthetic and real captured data, and show successful recovery of HS images for both indoor and outdoor scenes. In addition, we demonstrate other applications for the over-complete HS dictionary and sparse coding techniques, including 3D HS images compression and denoising."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17236","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17236","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17237","fieldValue":"Zhu, Jun-Yan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17237","fieldValue":" We describe a method for providing feedback on portrait expressions, and for selecting the most attractive expressions from large video\/photo collections. We capture a video of a subject's face while they are engaged in a task designed to elicit a range of positive emotions. We then use crowdsourcing to score the captured expressions for their attractiveness. We use these scores to train a model that can automatically predict attractiveness of different expressions of a given person. We also train a cross-subject model that evaluates portrait attractiveness of novel subjects and show how it can be used to automatically mine attractive photos from personal photo collections. Furthermore, we show how, with a little bit ($5-worth) of extra crowdsourcing, we can substantially improve the cross-subject model by \"fine-tuning\" it to a new individual using active learning. Finally, we demonstrate a training app that helps people learn how to mimic their best expressions."}
