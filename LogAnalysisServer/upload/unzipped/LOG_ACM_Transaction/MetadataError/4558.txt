This construction has advantages over the previous researches in the following points. (1) There is no need to search for primitive polynomials; a simple sufficient number-theoretic condition realizes maximal periodic CA with periods 2mâˆ\u2019 1, m =2, 3, 5, 89, 9689, 21701, 859433. (2) The configuration does not require hybrid constructions. This makes the implementation much easier. This is a modification of the Rule-90 by Wolfram. We list our CAs with maximal period, up to the size 300. We also discuss the controllability of the CA, randomness of the generated sequence, and a two-dimensional version."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/24785","fieldValue":"<italic>m<\/italic>-sequence"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24785","fieldValue":"<italic>m<\/italic>-sequence"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24785","fieldValue":"VLSI"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24785","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3396","fieldValue":"Liversedge, Simon P"}
