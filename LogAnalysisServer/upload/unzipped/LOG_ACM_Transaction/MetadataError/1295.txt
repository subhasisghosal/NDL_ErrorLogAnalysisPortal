{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15029","fieldValue":" Solid modelers must be based on reliable and fast algorithms for Boolean operations. The octree model, as well as several generalizations (polytrees, integrated polytrees, extended octrees), is specially well suited for these algorithms and can be used either as a primary or as a secondary model in solid modeling systems. This paper is concerned with a precise definition of the extended octree model that allows the representation of nonmanifold objects with planar faces and, consequently, is closed under Boolean operations on polyhedrons. Boolean nodes and nearly vertex nodes are introduced, and the model is discussed in comparison with related representations. A fast algorithm for the direct generation of the extended octree from the geometry of the base polygon in extrusion solids is presented, and its complexity is studied. Boolean operation algorithms are introduced."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15030","fieldValue":" We present a BÃ©zier representation of Ï\u201E-splines, curvature and torsion-continuous quintics, which were introduced in CAGD by Hagen in 1985 [32].

Thus, by embedding the BÃ©zier representation in a Î\u2019-spline representation of curvature and torsion-continuous quintic spline curves, given in [20], a Î\u2019-spline-BÃ©zier representation of Ï\u201E-splines results.Second, positivity conditions for the design parameters of the BÃ©zier representation and certain ranges of tension values are derived, which ensure properties like the convex hull and the variation-diminishing property of the Î\u2019-spline-BÃ©zier representation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15031","fieldValue":" In industrial design, the tool of choice for constructing surfaces that interpolate curves is the Boolean sum surface technique. However, if curves do not lie on constant parameter lines, reparametrizations will be needed, and this may introduce derivative discontinuities. A new technique which shows promise in overcoming this problem is described here. The method is based on describing the interpolation problem directly as a system of linear equations rather than as a curve-blending problem. The resulting system of equations is usually underdetermined and can be solved using numerical linear algebra methods without the a priori determination of certain parameters. The â\u20ACœfreeâ\u20AC? parameters can be used to control the shape of the resulting surface. Two examples of the procedure are given."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15031","fieldValue":"On the construction of surfaces interpolating curves.
