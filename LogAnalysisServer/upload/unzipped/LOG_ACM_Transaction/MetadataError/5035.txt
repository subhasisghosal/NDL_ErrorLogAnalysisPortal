{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3754","fieldValue":" Extracting desired source signals in noisy and reverberant environments is required in many hands-free communication systems. In practical situations, where the position and number of active sources may be unknown and time-varying, conventional implementations of spatial filters do not provide sufficiently good performance. Recently, informed spatial filters have been introduced that incorporate almost instantaneous parametric information on the sound field, thereby enabling adaptation to new acoustic conditions and moving sources. In this contribution, we propose a spatial filter which generalizes the recently proposed informed linearly constrained minimum variance filter and informed minimum mean square error filter. The proposed filter uses multiple direction-of-arrival estimates and second-order statistics of the noise and diffuse sound. To determine those statistics, an optimal diffuse power estimator is proposed that outperforms state-of-the-art estimators. Extensive performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed filter in dynamic acoustic conditions. For this purpose, we have considered a challenging scenario which consists of quickly moving sound sources during double-talk. The performance of the proposed spatial filter was evaluated in terms of objective measures including segmental signal-to-reverberation ratio and log spectral distance, and by means of a listening test confirming the objective results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3755","fieldValue":" When compared to intrusive speech intelligibility metrics, non-intrusive ones show a stronger dependency on speech content, given the lack of a reference signal for distortion level computation. Reduction of this dependency is an important step needed to develop reliable metrics. In this paper, two different updates to SRMR-CI, a recently-proposed speech intelligibility metric tailored for cochlear implant users, are applied. First, modulation energy thresholding is proposed to reduce the variability caused by the differences in modulation spectral representations for different phonemes and speakers, as well as speech enhancement algorithm artifacts. Second, a narrower range of modulation filters is employed to reduce fundamental frequency effects. Experimental results show that the updated metric outperforms two benchmark metrics, namely ModA and ANIQUE , by as much as 15% in terms of correlation between objective and subjective ratings, and a relative decrease of 47% in root mean square error compared to the previously-proposed SRMR-CI metric."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3755","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3755","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3756","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose a method for estimating target speech by exploring the spatial cues in adverse noise environments. This method is able to reliably estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using the phase difference obtained from dual-microphone signals. To this end, spatial cues such as the phase difference are used to estimate the target-to-non-target directional signal ratio (TNR). Based on the estimated TNR, a direction-of-arrival (DOA)-based SNR is then estimated by using a statistical model-based log-likelihood ratio test for the target speech activity decision followed by a decision-directed approach. The estimate is then incorporated into a Wiener filter in order to obtain a spectral-gain attenuator. The perceptual evaluation of speech quality shows that the performance of a dual-microphone speech enhancement system employing the proposed estimation method outperforms single-and dual-microphone speech enhancement systems that use conventional methods such as Wiener filtering, beamforming, or phase-error-based filtering under noise conditions whose SNR ranges from 0 to 20 dB."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3756","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3756","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3757","fieldValue":" Multichannel signal processing using a microphone array provides fundamental functions for coping with multisource situations, such as sound source localization and separation, that are needed to extract the auditory information for each source. Auditory uncertainties about the degree of reverberation and the number of sources are known to degrade performance or limit the practical application of microphone array processing. Such uncertainties must therefore be overcome to realize general and robust microphone array processing. These uncertainty issues have been partly addressed--existing methods focus on either source number uncertainty or the reverberation issue, where joint separation and dereverberation has been achieved only for the overdetermined conditions. This paper presents an all-round method that achieves source separation and dereverberation for an arbitrary number of sources including underdetermined conditions. Our method uses Bayesian nonparametrics that realize an infinitely extensible modeling flexibility so as to bypass the model selection in the separation and dereverberation problem, which is caused by the source number uncertainty. Evaluation using a dereverberation and separation task with various numbers of sources including underdetermined conditions demonstrates that (1) our method is applicable to the separation and dereverberation of underdetermined mixtures, and that (2) the source extraction performance is comparable to that of a state-of-the-art method suitable only for overdetermined conditions."}
