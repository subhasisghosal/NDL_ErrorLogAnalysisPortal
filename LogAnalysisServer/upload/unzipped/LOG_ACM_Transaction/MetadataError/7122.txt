{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9069","fieldValue":" We present an analysis for both oblivious and adaptive routing in regular, all-optical networks with wavelength translation. Our approach is simple, computationally inexpensive, accurate for both low and high network loads, and the first to analyze adaptive routing with wavelength translation in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks while also providing a simpler formulation of oblivious routing with wavelength translation. Unlike some previous analyses which use the link independence blocking assumption and the call dropping (loss) model (where blocked calls are cleared), we account for the dependence between the acquisition of wavelengths on successive links of a session's path and use a lossless model (where blocked calls are retried at a later time). We show that the throughput per wavelength increases superlinearly (as expected) as we increase the number of wavelengths per link, due both to additional capacity and more efficient use of this capacity; however, the extent of this superlinear increase in throughput saturates rather quickly to a linear increase. We also examine the effect that adaptive routing can have on performance. The analytical methodology that we develop can be applied to any vertex and edge symmetric topology, and with modifications, to any vertex symmetric (but not necessarily edge symmetric) topology. We find that, for the topologies we examine, providing at most one alternate link at every hop gives a per-wavelength throughput that is close to that achieved by oblivious routing with twice the number of wavelengths per link. This suggests some interesting possibilities for network provisioning in an all-optical network. We verify the accuracy of our analysis for both oblivious and adaptive routing via simulations for the torus and hypercube networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9069","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9069","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9069","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9070","fieldValue":" Because signals carried by two waveguides entering a common switch element would generate crosstalk, a regular N Ã\u2014 N multistage interconnection network (MIN) cannot be directly used as an optical switch between N inputs and N outputs in an optical network. A simple solution is to use a 2N Ã\u2014 2N cube-type MIN to provide the N Ã\u2014 N connections, which needs a much larger hardware cost. A recent research proposed another solution, called the time-domain approach, that divides the N optical inputs into several groups such that crosstalk-free connections can be provided by an N Ã\u2014 N regular MIN in several time slots, one for each group. Researchers studied this approach on Omega networks and defined the class set Î¸ to be the set of N-permutations realizable in two time slots on an Omega network. They proved that the size of Î¸ is larger than the size of class Î©, where Î© consists of all N-permutations admissible to a regular N Ã\u2014 N (nonoptical) Omega network. This paper first presents an optimal O(N log N) time algorithm for identifying whether a given permutation belongs to class Î¸ or not. Using this algorithm, this paper then proves an interesting result that the class Î¸ is identical to the class Î© + 1 which represents the set of N-permutations admissible to a nonoptical N Ã\u2014 N one-extra stage Omega network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9070","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9070","fieldValue":"Equivalent permutation capabilities between time-division optical omega networks and non-optical extra-stage omega networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9070","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9070","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8342","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
