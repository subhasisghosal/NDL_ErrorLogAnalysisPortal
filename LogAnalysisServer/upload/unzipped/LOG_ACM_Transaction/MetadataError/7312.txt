{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9442","fieldValue":" IP multicast is facing a slow take-off although it has been a hotly debated topic for more than a decade. Many reasons are responsible for this status. Hence, the Internet is likely to be organized with both unicast and multicast enabled networks. Thus, it is of utmost importance to design protocols that allow the progressive deployment of the multicast service by supporting unicast clouds. This paper presents HBH (hop-by-hop multicast routing protocol). HBH adopts the source-specific channel abstraction to simplify address allocation and implements data distribution using recursive unicast trees, which allow the transparent support of unicast-only routers. An important original feature of HBH is its tree construction algorithm that takes into account the unicast routing asymmetries. Since most multicast routing protocols rely on the unicast infrastructure, the unicast asymmetries impact the structure of the multicast trees. We show through simulation that HBH outperforms other multicast routing protocols in terms of the delay experienced by the receivers and the bandwidth consumption of the multicast trees. Additionally, we show that HBH can be incrementally deployed and that with a small fraction of HBH-enabled routers in the network HBH outperforms application-layer multicast."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9442","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9443","fieldValue":" This work presents a thorough investigation of the structure of multicast trees cut from the Internet and power-law topologies. Based on both generated topologies and real Internet data, we characterize the structure of such trees and show that they obey the rank-degree power law; that most high degree tree nodes are concentrated in a low diameter neighborhood; and that the sub-tree size also obeys a power law.Our most surprising empirical finding suggests that there is a linear ratio between the number of high degree network nodes, namely nodes whose tree degree is higher than some constant, and the number of leaf nodes in the multicast tree (clients). We also derive this ratio analytically. Based on this finding, we develop the Fast Algorithm, that estimates the number of clients, and show that it converges faster than one round trip delay from the root to a randomly selected client."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9443","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9443","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9443","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9444","fieldValue":" There has been much interest in admission control schemes that place the burden of admission control decisions on the end users. In these schemes, referred to as Endpoint Admission Control, the decision to join the network is taken by the user, based on the probing of the network using probe packets. Depending on the level of congestion, routers mark the probe packets and thus inform the user of the state of the network. In this paper, we analyze three mechanisms for providing Endpoint Admission Control: virtual-queue marking, random-early marking and tail drop. For each scheme, we analyze the probing duration necessary to guarantee the required QoS and achieve high link utilization. Our main conclusion is that very few probe packets have to be sent when early marking is used, whereas tail drop requires a large number of probe packets."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9444","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
