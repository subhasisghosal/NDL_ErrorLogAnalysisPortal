In a DISN, a large volume of data gets generated, which is first stored in the network and is later collected for further analysis when the next uploading opportunity arises. The key concern in DISNs is to be able to redistribute the data from data-generating nodes into the network under limited storage and energy constraints at the sensor nodes. We formulate the data redistribution problem where the objective is to minimize the total energy consumption during this process while guaranteeing full utilization of the distributed storage capacity in the DISNs. We show that the problem is APX-hard for arbitrary data sizes; therefore, a polynomial time approximation algorithm is unlikely. For unit data sizes, we show that the problem is equivalent to the minimum cost flow problem, which can be solved optimally. However, the optimal solution's centralized nature makes it unsuitable for large-scale distributed sensor networks. Thus, we design a distributed algorithm for the data redistribution problem which performs very close to the optimal, and compare its performance with various intuitive heuristics. The distributed algorithm relies on potential function-based computations, incurs limited message and computational overhead at both the sensor nodes and data generator nodes, and is easily implementable in a distributed manner. We analytically study the convergence and performance of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its near-optimal performance and scalability under various network scenarios. In addition, we implement the distributed algorithm in TinyOS, evaluate it using TOSSIM simulator, and show that it outperforms EnviroStore, the only existing scheme for data redistribution in sensor networks, in both solution quality and message overhead. Finally, we extend the proposed algorithm to avoid disproportionate energy consumption at different sensor nodes without compromising the solution quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21407","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2422966.2422968\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21408","fieldValue":" Wearable sensing systems have recently enabled a variety of medical monitoring and diagnostic applications in wireless health. The need for multiple sensors and constant monitoring leads these systems to be power hungry and expensive with short operating lifetimes. We introduce a novel methodology that takes advantage of contextual and semantic properties in human behavior to enable efficient design and optimization of such systems from the data and information point of view. This, in turn, directly influences the wireless communication and local processing power consumption. We exploit intrinsic space and temporal correlations between sensor data while considering both user and system contextual behavior. Our goal is to select a small subset of sensors that accurately capture and\/or predict all possible signals of a fully instrumented wearable sensing system. Our approach leverages novel modeling, partitioning, and behavioral optimization, which consists of signal characterization, segmentation and time shifting, mutual signal prediction, and a simultaneous minimization composed of subset sensor selection and opportunistic sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on an insole instrumented with 99 pressure sensors placed in each shoe, which cover the bottom of the entire foot, resulting in energy reduction of 72&percnt; to 97&percnt; for error rates of 5&percnt; to 17.5&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/21408","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2422966.2422969\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21408","fieldValue":"ACM"}
