Its main feature is that it provides constant worst-case search time. The aim of this article is to present a precise average case analysis of Cuckoo hashing. In particular, we determine the probability that Cuckoo hashing produces no conflicts and give an upper bound for the construction time, that is linear in the size of the table. The analysis rests on a generating function approach to the so called Cuckoo Graph, a random bipartite graph, and an application of a double saddle point method to obtain asymptotic expansions. Furthermore, we provide some results concerning the structure of these kinds of random graphs. Our results extend the analysis of Devroye and Morin [2003]. Additionally, we provide numerical results confirming the mathematical analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16124","fieldValue":" We present a new general-purpose method for optimizing existing point sets. The resulting distributions possess high-quality blue noise characteristics and adapt precisely to given density functions. Our method is similar to the commonly used Lloyd's method while avoiding its drawbacks. We achieve our results by utilizing the concept of capacity, which for each point is determined by the area of its Voronoi region weighted with an underlying density function. We demand that each point has the same capacity. In combination with a dedicated optimization algorithm, this capacity constraint enforces that each point obtains equal importance in the distribution. Our method can be used as a drop-in replacement for Lloyd's method, and combines enhancement of blue noise characteristics and density function adaptation in one operation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16124","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16124","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16125","fieldValue":" We develop a method for reliable simulation of elastica in complex contact scenarios. Our focus is on firmly establishing three parameter-independent guarantees: that simulations of well-posed problems (a) have no interpenetrations, (b) obey causality, momentum- and energy-conservation laws, and (c) complete in finite time. We achieve these guarantees through a novel synthesis of asynchronous variational integrators, kinetic data structures, and a discretization of the contact barrier potential by an infinite sum of nested quadratic potentials. In a series of two- and three-dimensional examples, we illustrate that this method more easily handles challenging problems involving complex contact geometries, sharp features, and sliding during extremely tight contact."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16125","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16125","fieldValue":"ACM"}
