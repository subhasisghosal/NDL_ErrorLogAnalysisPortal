In this article, we consider the application-specific NoC architecture design problem in a 3D environment. We present an efficient floorplan-aware 3D NoC synthesis algorithm based on simulated allocation (SAL), a stochastic method for traffic flow routing, and accurate power and delay models for NoC components. We demonstrate that this method finds greatly improved solutions compared to a baseline algorithm reflecting prior work. To evaluate the SAL method, we compare its performance with the widely used simulated annealing (SA) method and show that SAL is much faster than SA for this application, while providing solutions of very similar quality. We then extend the approach from a single-path routing to a multipath routing scheme and explore the trade-off between power consumption and runtime for these two schemes. Finally, we study the impact of various factors on the network performance in 3D NoCs, including the TSV count and the number of 3D tiers. Our studies show that link power and delay can be significantly improved when moving from a 2D to a 3D implementation, but the improvement flattens out as the number of 3D tiers goes beyond a certain point."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13255","fieldValue":"3D"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13255","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13255","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13256","fieldValue":" Three-dimensional (3D) stacking technology enables integration of more memory on top of chip multiprocessors (CMPs). As the number of cores and the capacity of on-chip memory increase, the Non-Uniform Cache Architecture (NUCA) becomes more attractive. Compared to 2D cases, 3D stacking provides more options for the design of on-chip memory due to numerous advantages, such as the extra layout dimension, low latency across layers, etc. On the other hand, 3D stacking aggravates the thermal problem due to the increase of power density. In this work, we first study the design of 3D-stacked set-associative L2 caches through managing the placement of cache ways. The evaluation results show that the placement and corresponding management of 3D cache ways have an impact on the performance of CMPs. Then, we show that the efficiency of thermal control is also related to the placement of cache ways. For caches implemented with different memory technologies, the placement and management of cache ways have different effects on power consumption and power distribution. Consequently, we propose techniques to improve the efficiency of thermal control for different memory technologies. The evaluation results show the trade-off between performance and thermal control efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13256","fieldValue":"3D"}
