For instance, Internet-based maps contain satellite and aerial photography. Zooming within these maps may reveal jarring transitions. We present a scheme that creates a visually smooth mipmap pyramid from stitched imagery at several scales. The scheme involves two new techniques. The first, structure transfer, is a nonlinear operator that combines the detail of one image with the local appearance of another. We use this operator to inject detail from the fine image into the coarse one while retaining color consistency. The improved structural similarity greatly reduces inter-level ghosting artifacts. The second, clipped Laplacian blending, is an efficient construction to minimize blur when creating intermediate levels. It considers the sum of all inter-level image differences within the pyramid. We demonstrate continuous zooming of map imagery from space to ground level."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16385","fieldValue":" Catadioptric imaging systems are commonly used for wide-angle imaging, but lead to multi-perspective images which do not allow algorithms designed for perspective cameras to be used. Efficient use of such systems requires accurate geometric ray modeling as well as fast algorithms. We present accurate geometric modeling of the multi-perspective photo captured with a spherical catadioptric imaging system using axial-cone cameras: multiple perspective cameras lying on an axis each with a different viewpoint and a different cone of rays. This modeling avoids geometric approximations and allows several algorithms developed for perspective cameras to be applied to multi-perspective catadioptric cameras. We demonstrate axial-cone modeling in the context of rendering wide-angle light fields, captured using a spherical mirror array. We present several applications such as spherical distortion correction, digital refocusing for artistic depth of field effects in wide-angle scenes, and wide-angle dense depth estimation. Our GPU implementation using axial-cone modeling achieves up to three orders of magnitude speed up over ray tracing for these applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16385","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16385","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2553","fieldValue":" It is well known that in a network with arbitrary (convex) latency functions that are a function of edge traffic, the worst-case ratio, over all inputs, of the system delay caused due to selfish behavior versus the system delay of the optimal centralized solution may be unbounded even if the system consists of only two parallel links. This ratio is called the price of anarchy (PoA). In this article, we investigate ways by which one can reduce the performance degradation due to selfish behavior. We investigate two primary methods (a) Stackelberg routing strategies, where a central authority, for example, network manager, controls a fixed fraction of the flow, and can route this flow in any desired way so as to influence the flow of selfish users; and (b) network tolls, where tolls are imposed on the edges to modify the latencies of the edges, and thereby influence the induced Nash equilibrium. We obtain results demonstrating the effectiveness of both Stackelberg strategies and tolls in controlling the price of anarchy. For Stackelberg strategies, we obtain the first results for nonatomic routing in graphs more general than parallel-link graphs, and strengthen existing results for parallel-link graphs. (i) In series-parallel graphs, we show that Stackelberg routing reduces the PoA to a constant (depending on the fraction of flow controlled). (ii) For general graphs, we obtain latency-class specific bounds on the PoA with Stackelberg routing, which give a continuous trade-off between the fraction of flow controlled and the price of anarchy. (iii) In parallel-link graphs, we show that for any given class L of latency functions, Stackelberg routing reduces the PoA to at most Î± + (1-Î±)Ä\u2039Ï?(L), where Î± is the fraction of flow controlled and Ï?(L) is the PoA of class L (when Î± = 0). For network tolls, motivated by the known strong results for nonatomic games, we consider the more general setting of atomic splittable routing games. We show that tolls inducing an optimal flow always exist, even for general asymmetric games with heterogeneous users, and can be computed efficiently by solving a convex program. This resolves a basic open question about the effectiveness of tolls for atomic splittable games. Furthermore, we give a complete characterization of flows that can be induced via tolls."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2553","fieldValue":"ACM"}
