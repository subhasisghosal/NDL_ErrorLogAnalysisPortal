The conditional diagnosability, which is more general than the classical diagnosability, is to measure the diagnosability of a multiprocessor system under the assumption that all of the neighbors of any node in the system cannot fail at the same time. This study shows that the conditional diagnosability for k-ary n-cubes under the PMC model is 8nâ\u20AC\u2030âˆ\u2019â\u20AC\u20307 for kâ\u20AC\u2030â\u2030¥â\u20AC\u20304 and nâ\u20AC\u2030â\u2030¥â\u20AC\u20304."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13289","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13289","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13290","fieldValue":"Chakrabarti, P P"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13290","fieldValue":" We present a symbolic-event-propagation-based scheme to generate hazard-free tests for robust path delay faults.

We address the problem of finding a minimal set of test vectors that covers all robustly testable paths. We propose greedy and simulated-annealing-based algorithms to find the same. Results on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits show a considerable reduction in test vectors for covering all robustly testable paths."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13290","fieldValue":"ACM"}
