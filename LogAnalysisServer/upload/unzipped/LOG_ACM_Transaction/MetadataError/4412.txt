The paper develops two main contributions: (a) a specific design methodology for data-intensive Web sites, composed of a set of steps and design transformations that lead from a conceptual specification of the domain of interest to the actual implementation of the site; (b) a tool called Homer, conceived to support the site design and implementation process, by allowing the designer to move through the various steps of the methodology, and to automate the generation of the code needed to implement the actual site.Our approach to site design is based on a clear separation between several design activities, namely database design, hypertext design, and presentation design. All these activities are carried on by using high-level models, all subsumed by an extension of the nested relational model; the mappings between the models can be nicely expressed using an extended relational algebra for nested structures. Based on the design artifacts produced during the design process, and on their representation in the algebraic framework, Homer is able to generate all the code needed for the actual generation of the site, in a completely automatic way."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24277","fieldValue":"WWW"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24277","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24277","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24278","fieldValue":" The discipline of Web Usage Mining has grown rapidly in the past few years, despite the crash of the e-commerce boom of the late 1990s. Web Usage Mining is the application of data mining techniques to Web clickstream data in order to extract usage patterns. Yet, with all of the resources put into the problem, claims of success have been limited and are often tied to specific Web site properties that are not found in general. One reason for the limited success has been a component of Web Usage Mining that is often overlooked---the need to understand the content and structure of a Web site. The processing and quantification of a Web sites content and structure for all but completely static and single frame Web sites is arguably one of the most difficult tasks to automate in the Web Usage Mining process. This article shows that, not only is the Web Usage Mining process enhanced by content and structure, it cannot be completed without it. The results of experiments run on data from a large e-commerce site are presented to show that proper preprocessing cannot be completed without the use of Web site content and structure, and that the effectiveness of pattern analysis is greatly enhanced."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24278","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24278","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24279","fieldValue":" XDuce is a statically typed programming language for XML processing. Its basic data values are XML documents, and its types (so-called regular expression types) directly correspond to document schemas. XDuce also provides a flexible form of regular expression pattern matching, integrating conditional branching, tag checking, and subtree extraction, as well as dynamic typechecking. We survey the principles of XDuce's design, develop examples illustrating its key features, describe its foundations in the theory of regular tree automata, and present a complete formal definition of its core, along with a proof of type safety."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24279","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24279","fieldValue":"ACM"}
