The result is an often suboptimal HA setting whereby the full potential of modern hearing aids is not utilized. This article proposes an interactive hearing-aid personalization system that obtains an optimal individual setting of the hearing aids from direct perceptual user feedback. Results obtained with ten hearing-impaired subjects show that ten to twenty pairwise user assessments between different settings--equivalent to 5-10 min--is sufficient for personalization of up to four hearing-aid parameters. A setting obtained by the system was significantly preferred by the subject over the initial fitting, and the obtained setting could be reproduced with reasonable precision. The system may have potential for clinical usage to assist both the hearing-care professional and the user."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3776","fieldValue":" In this paper, spatio-temporal filtering methods are proposed for estimating the direction-of-arrival (DOA) and fundamental frequency of periodic signals, like those produced by the speech production system and many musical instruments using microphone arrays. This topic has quite recently received some attention in the community and is quite promising for several applications. The proposed methods are based on optimal, adaptive filters that leave the desired signal, having a certain DOA and fundamental frequency, undistorted and suppress everything else. The filtering methods simultaneously operate in space and time, whereby it is possible resolve cases that are otherwise problematic for pitch estimators or DOA estimators based on beamforming. Several special cases and improvements are considered, including a method for estimating the covariance matrix based on the recently proposed iterative adaptive approach (IAA). Experiments demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed methods under adverse conditions compared to the state of the art using both synthetic signals and real signals, as well as illustrate the properties of the methods and the filters."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3777","fieldValue":"Tan, Zheng-Hua"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3777","fieldValue":" In this work, we consider the problem of feature enhancement for noise-robust automatic speech recognition (ASR). We propose a method for minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation of mel-frequency cepstral features, which is based on a minimum number of well-established, theoretically consistent statistical assumptions. More specifically, the method belongs to the class of methods relying on the statistical framework proposed in Ephraim and Malah's original work (\"Speech enhancement using a minimum mean-square error short-time spectral amplitude estimator,\" IEEE Trans. Acoust., Speech, Signal Process., vol. ASSP-32, no. 6, 1984). The method is general in that it allows MMSE estimation of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC's), cepstral-mean subtracted (CMS-) MFCC's, autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA)-filtered CMS-MFCC's, velocity, and acceleration coefficients. In addition, the method is easily modified to take into account other compressive non-linearities than the logarithm traditionally used for MFCC computation. In terms of MFCC estimation performance, as measured by MFCC mean-square error, the proposed method shows performance which is identical to or better than other state-of-the-art methods. In terms of ASR performance, no statistical difference could be found between the proposed method and the state-of-the-art methods. We conclude that existing state-of-the-art MFCC feature enhancement algorithms within this class of algorithms, while theoretically suboptimal or based on theoretically inconsistent assumptions, perform close to optimally in the MMSE sense."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3777","fieldValue":"Minimum mean-square error estimation of mel-frequency cepstral features-a theoretically consistent approach"}
