However, the effectiveness and performance of most preconditioners is not only problem dependent, but also fairly sensitive to the choice of their tunable parameters. As a result, a typical practitioner is faced with an overwhelming number of choices of solvers, preconditioners, and their parameters. The diversity of preconditioners makes it difficult to analyze them in a unified theoretical model. A systematic empirical evaluation of existing preconditioned iterative solvers can help in identifying the relative advantages of various implementations. We present the results of a comprehensive experimental study of the most popular preconditioner and iterative solver combinations for symmetric positive-definite systems. We introduce a methodology for a rigorous comparative evaluation of various preconditioners, including the use of some simple but powerful metrics. The detailed comparison of various preconditioner implementations and a state-of-the-art direct solver gives interesting insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses. We believe that these results would be useful to researchers developing preconditioners and iterative solvers as well as practitioners looking for appropriate sparse solvers for their applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19327","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19327","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2869","fieldValue":"Wu, Chung-Hsien"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2869","fieldValue":"Yeh, Jui-Feng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2869","fieldValue":"Chen, Ming-Jun"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2869","fieldValue":" This investigation presents an approach to domain-specific FAQ (frequently-asked question) retrieval using independent aspects. The data analysis classifies the questions in the collected QA (question-answer) pairs into ten question types in accordance with question stems. The answers in the QA pairs are then paragraphed and clustered using latent semantic analysis and the K-means algorithm. For semantic representation of the aspects, a domain-specific ontology is constructed based on WordNet and HowNet. A probabilistic mixture model is then used to interpret the query and QA pairs based on independent aspects; hence the retrieval process can be viewed as the maximum likelihood estimation problem. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to estimate the optimal mixing weights in the probabilistic mixture model. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperformed the FAQ-Finder system in medical FAQ retrieval."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2869","fieldValue":"ACM"}
