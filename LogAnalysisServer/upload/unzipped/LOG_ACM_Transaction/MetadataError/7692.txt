However, unrestricted routing policies can adversely impact routing stability. A key concept to understand the interplay between autonomy and expressiveness on one side, and stability on the other side, is safety under filtering, i.e., guaranteed stability under autonomous usage of route filters. BGP route filters are used to selectively advertise specific routes to specific neighbors. In this paper, we provide a characterization of safety under filtering, filling the large gap between previously known necessary and sufficient conditions. Our characterization is based on the absence of a particular kind of dispute wheel, a structure involving circular dependencies among routing preferences. We exploit our result to show that networks admitting multiple stable states are provably unsafe under filtering, and the troublesome portion of the configuration can be pinpointed starting from the stable states alone. This is especially interesting from an operational point of view since networks with multiple stable states actually happen in practice (BGP wedgies). Finally, we show that adding filters to an existing configuration may lead to oscillations even if the configuration is safe under any link failure. Unexpectedly, we find policy configurations where misconfigured filters can do more harm than network faults."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10195","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10196","fieldValue":"Chuah, Chen-Nee"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10196","fieldValue":" A significant fraction of network events (such as topology or route changes) and the resulting performance degradation stem from premeditated network management and operational tasks. This paper introduces a general class of Graceful Network State Migration (GNSM) problems, where the goal is to discover the optimal sequence of operations that progressively transition the network from its initial to a desired final state while minimizing the overall performance disruption. We investigate two specific GNSM problems: 1) Link Weight Reassignment Scheduling (LWRS) studies the optimal ordering of link weight updates to migrate from an existing to a new link weight assignment; and 2) Link Maintenance Scheduling (LMS) looks at how to schedule link deactivations and subsequent reactivations for maintenance purposes. LWRS and LMS are both combinatorial optimization problems. We use dynamic programming to find the optimal solutions when the problem size is small, and leverage ant colony optimization to get near-optimal solutions for large problem sizes. Our simulation study reveals that judiciously ordering network operations can achieve significant performance gains. Our GNSM solution framework is generic and applies to similar problems with different operational contexts, underlying network protocols or mechanisms, and performance metrics."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10196","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10196","fieldValue":"ACM"}
