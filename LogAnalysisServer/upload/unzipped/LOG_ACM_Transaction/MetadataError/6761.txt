The information on each site is often partial. When sources of complementary information are integrated, a better profile of a user can be built. This profile can help improve online services such as advertising across sites. To integrate these sources of information, it is necessary to identify individuals across social media sites. This paper aims to address the cross-media user identification problem. We provide evidence on the existence of a mapping among identities of individuals across social media sites, study the feasibility of finding this mapping, and illustrate and develop means for finding this mapping. Our studies show that effective approaches that exploit information redundancies due to usersâ\u20AC™ unique behavioral patterns can be utilized to find such a mapping. This study paves the way for analysis and mining across social networking sites, and facilitates the creation of novel online services across sites. In particular, recommending friends and advertising across networks, analyzing information diffusion across sites, and studying specific user behavior such as user migration across sites in social media are one of the many areas that can benefit from the results of this study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8034","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8034","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8035","fieldValue":" Social media has become increasingly prevalent in the last few years, not only enabling people to connect with each other by social links, but also providing platforms for people to share information and interact over diverse topics. Rich user-generated information, for example, usersâ\u20AC™ relationships and daily posts, are often available in most social media service websites. Given such information, a challenging problem is to provide reasonable user and community recommendation for a target user, and consequently, help the target user engage in the daily discussions and activities with his\/her friends or like-minded people. In this article, we propose a unified framework of recommending users and communities that utilizes the information in social media. Given a userâ\u20AC™s profile or a set of keywords as input, our framework is capable of recommending influential users and topic-cohesive interactive communities that are most relevant to the given user or keywords. With the proposed framework, users can find other individuals or communities sharing similar interests, and then have more interaction with these users or within the communities. We present a generative topic model to discover user-oriented and community-oriented topics simultaneously, which enables us to capture the exact topical interests of users, as well as the focuses of communities. Extensive experimental evaluation and case studies on a dataset collected from Twitter demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared with other probabilistic-topic-model-based recommendation methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8036","fieldValue":" Traditional anomaly detection on social media mostly focuses on individual point anomalies while anomalous phenomena usually occur in groups. Therefore, it is valuable to study the collective behavior of individuals and detect group anomalies. Existing group anomaly detection approaches rely on the assumption that the groups are known, which can hardly be true in real world social media applications. In this article, we take a generative approach by proposing a hierarchical Bayes model: Group Latent Anomaly Detection (GLAD) model. GLAD takes both pairwise and point-wise data as input, automatically infers the groups and detects group anomalies simultaneously. To account for the dynamic properties of the social media data, we further generalize GLAD to its dynamic extension d-GLAD. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our models on both synthetic and real world datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is effective and robust in discovering latent groups and detecting group anomalies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8036","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8036","fieldValue":"ACM"}
