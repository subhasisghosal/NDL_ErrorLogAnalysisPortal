Their proof is beautiful but uses a nonconstructive argument based on Ehrenfeucht-Fra√Øss√© games. We give an alternative, more explicit, proof that works by simple syntactic manipulations of resolution refutations. As a by-product, we develop a ‚\u20ACúblack-box‚\u20AC? technique for proving space lower bounds via a ‚\u20ACústatic‚\u20AC? complexity measure that works against any resolution refutation‚\u20AC\u201Dprevious techniques have been inherently adaptive. We conclude by showing that the related question for polynomial calculus (i.e., whether space is an upper bound on degree) seems unlikely to be resolvable by similar methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11757","fieldValue":"PCR"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11757","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11757","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11758","fieldValue":"Willemse, Tim A C"}
