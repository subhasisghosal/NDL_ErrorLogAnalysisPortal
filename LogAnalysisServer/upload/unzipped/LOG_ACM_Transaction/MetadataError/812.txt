The process of power grid design is inherently iterative, during which numerous small changes are made to an initial design, either to enhance the design or to fix design constraint violations. Due to the large sizes of power grids in modern chips, updating the solution for these perturbations can be a computationally intensive task. In this work, we first introduce an accurate modeling methodology for power grids that, contrary to conventional models, can result in asymmetrical equations. Next, we propose an efficient and accurate incremental solver that utilizes the backward random walks to identify the region of influence of the perturbation. The solution of the network is then updated for this significantly smaller region only. The proposed algorithm is capable of handling both symmetrical and asymmetrical power grid equations. Moreover, it can handle consecutive perturbations without any degradation in the quality of the solution. Experimental results show speedups of up to 13Ã\u2014 for our incremental solver, as compared to a full resolve of the power grid."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13388","fieldValue":" FlexRay has now become a well-established in-vehicle communication bus at most original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as BMW, Audi, and GM. Given the increasing cost of verification and the high degree of crosslinking between components in automotive architectures, an incremental design process is commonly followed. In order to incorporate FlexRay-based designs in such a process, the resulting schedules must be extensible, that is: (i) when messages are added in later iterations, they must preserve deadline guarantees of already scheduled messages, and (ii) they must accommodate as many new messages as possible without changes to existing schedules. Apart from extensible scheduling having not received much attention so far, traditional metrics used for quantifying them cannot be trivially adapted to FlexRay schedules. This is because they do not exploit specific properties of the FlexRay protocol. In this article we, for the first time, introduce new notions of extensibility for FlexRay that capture all the protocol-specific properties. In particular, we focus on the dynamic segment of FlexRay and we present a number of metrics to quantify extensible schedules. Based on the introduced metrics, we propose strategies to synthesize extensible schedules and compare the results of different scheduling algorithms. We demonstrate the applicability of the results with industrial-size case studies and also show that the proposed metrics may also be visually represented, thereby allowing for easy interpretation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13388","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13388","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13389","fieldValue":"Pan, Gung-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13389","fieldValue":"Jou, Jing-Yang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13389","fieldValue":"Lai, Bo-Cheng"}
