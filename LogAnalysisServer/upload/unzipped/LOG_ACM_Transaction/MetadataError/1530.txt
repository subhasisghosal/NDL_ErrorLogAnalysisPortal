The proposed aggressive visibility solution is based on stochastic ray shooting and can take any triangular model as input. We do not rely on connectivity information, volumetric occluders, or the availability of large occluders, and can therefore process any given input scene. The proposed algorithm is practically memoryless, thereby alleviating the large memory consumption problems prevalent in several previous algorithms. The strategy of our algorithm is to use ray mutations in ray space to cast rays that are likely to sample new triangles. Our algorithm improves the sampling efficiency of previous work by over two orders of magnitude."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15650","fieldValue":"PVS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15650","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15650","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15651","fieldValue":" Sampling distributions with blue noise characteristics are widely used in computer graphics. Although Poisson-disk distributions are known to have excellent blue noise characteristics, they are generally regarded as too computationally expensive to generate in real time. We present a new method for sampling by dart-throwing in O(N log N) time and introduce a novel and efficient variation for generating Poisson-disk distributions in O(N) time and space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15651","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15651","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15652","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}
