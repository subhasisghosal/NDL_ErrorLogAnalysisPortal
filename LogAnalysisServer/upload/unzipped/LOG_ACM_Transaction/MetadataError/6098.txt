{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6273","fieldValue":" Classical compiler optimizations assume a fixed cache architecture and modify the program to take best advantage of it. In some cases, this may not be the best strategy because each nest might work best with a different cache configuration and transforming a nest for a given fixed cache configuration may not be possible due to data and control dependences. Working with a fixed cache configuration can also increase energy consumption in loops where the best required configuration is smaller than the default (fixed) one. In this paper, we take an alternate approach and modify the cache configuration for each nest, depending on the access pattern exhibited by the nest. We call this technique compiler-directed cache polymorphism (CDCP). More specifically, in this paper, we make the following contributions. First, we present an approach for analyzing data reuse properties of loop nests. Second, we give algorithms to simulate the footprints of array references in their reuse space. Third, based on our reuse analysis, we present an optimization algorithm to compute the cache configurations for each loop nest. Our experimental results show that CDCP is very effective in finding the near-optimal data cache configurations for different nests in array-intensive applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6273","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6273","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6274","fieldValue":" With the proliferation of location dependent applications in sensor networks, location awareness becomes an essential capability of sensor nodes. Because coarse accuracy is sufficient for most sensor network applications, solutions in range-free localization are being pursued as a cost-effective alternative to more expensive range-based approaches. In this paper, we present APIT, a novel localization algorithm that is range-free. We show that our APIT scheme performs best when an irregular radio pattern and random node placement are considered, and low communication overhead is desired. We compare our work, via extensive simulation, with three state-of-the-art range-free localization schemes to identify the preferable system configurations of each. In addition, we provide insight into the impact of localization accuracy on various location dependent applications and suggestions on improving their performance in the presence of such inaccuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1522","fieldValue":" The dominance of computer technology in work and leisure poses challenges for older people. Their lack of computer experience and computer literacy impedes their ability to explore and use new interactive systems. This is particularly challenging for the design of public access systems, such as ticket vending machines (TVM). This article describes a conflict relevant for many designers considering age-related differences in technology use: should the user be taught to use the existing design or should the design be changed to accommodate older users? An experiment was conducted to directly compare these alternative approaches with each other and with a simulation of an existing TVM. It compares three TVM designs regarding the usability criteria of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction, controlling for age, and cognitive and motivational characteristics. 62 older (M &equals; 68 years) and 62 younger (M &equals; 25 years) participants were split into three groups: The control group solved 11 tasks using a simulation of the TVM, the video group watched a brief instructional video before solving the same tasks with the same TVM, and the wizard group used a redesigned wizard interface instead. Results indicate that young and old participantsâ\u20AC™ performance improved after watching the video, but older participants improved more, reaching the effectiveness of the young control group. In the wizard condition, age differences in effectiveness and satisfaction were eliminated; however, speed differences remained in all conditions. The results suggest that the simple integration of minimal video instruction or a task-oriented wizard design can make public access systems truly universally usable, and that the wizard TVM was a true â\u20ACœwalk-up-and-use system.â\u20AC?"}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/1522","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Department of Psychology, Humboldt-Universit&#228;t zu Berlin, Germany (Sengpiel, Michael)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1522","fieldValue":"ACM"}
