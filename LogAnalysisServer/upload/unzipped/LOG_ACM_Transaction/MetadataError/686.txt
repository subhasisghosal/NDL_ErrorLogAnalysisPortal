During construction of such a system, constraint violations often arise, and they need to be resolved. Previous algorithms for this task fall into two groups: those algorithms that are fast but cannot resolve all violations, and those algorithms that can resolve all violations but are exponentially slow. We propose the first algorithms that are fast as well as able to resolve all violations. Moreover, unlike the previous algorithms, our algorithms support the ordering of violations using their inherent criticality or user-defined priority. We provably and experimentally justify the efficiency and efficacy of our algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13111","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13111","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2249","fieldValue":" We show that for every radio network G &equals; (V, E) and source s ∈ V, there exists a radio broadcast schedule for G of length Rad(G, s) &plus; O(&sqrt;Rad(G, s) $ṡlog^2 n) &equals; O(Rad(G, s) &plus; log4 n), where Rad(G, s) is the radius of the radio network G with respect to the source s.

In this article we extend the design intent coverage methodology to hybrid specifications containing both state-machines and formal properties. We demonstrate the benefits of this extension in two domains of considerable recent interest, namely (a) the use of auxiliary state-machines in formal specifications, and (b) the use of modest sized RTL blocks in the design intent coverage analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13112","fieldValue":"ACM"}
