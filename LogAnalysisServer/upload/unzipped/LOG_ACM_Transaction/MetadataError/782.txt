Thermal simulation based on the detailed thermal structures no longer meets the demanding tasks for efficient design space exploration. The compact and composable model-based simulation provides a viable solution to this difficult problem. However, building such thermal models from detailed thermal structures was not well addressed in the past. In this article, we propose a new compact thermal modeling technique, called ThermComp, standing for thermal modeling with composable modules. ThermComp can be used for fast thermal design space exploration for multicore microprocessors. The new approach builds the composable model from detailed structures for each basic module using the finite difference method and reduces the model complexity by the sampling-based model order reduction technique. These composable models are then used to assemble different multicore architecture thermal models and realized into SPICE-like netlists. The resulting thermal models can be simulated by the general circuit simulator SPICE. ThermComp tries to preserve the accuracy of fine-grained models with the speed of coarse-grained models. Experimental results on a number of multicore microprocessor architectures show the new approach can easily build accurate thermal systems from compact composable models for fast architecture thermal analysis and optimization and is much faster than the existing HotSpot method with similar accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/13322","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442087.2442099\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13322","fieldValue":"Composable thermal modeling and simulation for architecture-level thermal designs of multicore microprocessors"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13322","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13322","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13323","fieldValue":" Modern IC power delivery systems encompass large on-chip passive power grids and active on-chip or off-chip voltage converters and regulators. While there exists little work targeting on holistic design of such complex IC subsystems, the optimal system-level design of power delivery is critical for achieving power integrity and power efficiency. In this article, we conduct a systematic design analysis on power delivery networks that incorporate Buck Converters (BCs) and on-chip Low-Dropout voltage regulators (LDOs) for the entire chip power supply. The electrical interactions between active voltage converters, regulators as well as passive power grids and their influence on key system design specifications are analyzed comprehensively. With the derived design insights, the system-level codesign of a complete power delivery network is facilitated by a proposed automatic optimization flow in which key design parameters of buck converters and on-chip LDOs as well as on-chip decoupling capacitance are jointly optimized. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements resulted from the proposed system cooptimization in terms of achievable area overhead, supply noise and power efficiency. Impacts of different decoupling capacitance technologies are also investigated."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/13323","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2442087.2442100\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13323","fieldValue":"IC power delivery: Voltage regulation and conversion, system-level cooptimization and technology implications"}
