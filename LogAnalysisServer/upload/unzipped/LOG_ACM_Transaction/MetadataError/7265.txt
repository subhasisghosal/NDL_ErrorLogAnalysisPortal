We envision an infrastructure that consists of beacon nodes and provides the service of estimating network distance between pairs of hosts without direct delay measurement. We show that the principal component analysis (PCA) technique can effectively extract topological information from delay measurements between beacon hosts. Based on PCA, we devise a transformation method that projects the raw distance space into a new coordinate system of (much) smaller dimensions. The transformation retains as much topological information as possible and yet enables end hosts to determine their coordinates in the coordinate system. The resulting new coordinate system is termed as the Internet Coordinate System (ICS). As compared to existing work (e.g., IDMaps and GNP), ICS incurs smaller computation overhead in calculating the coordinates of hosts and smaller measurement overhead (required for end hosts to measure their distances to beacon hosts). Finally, we show via experiments with both real-life and synthetic data sets that ICS makes robust and accurate estimates of network distances, incurs little computational overhead, and its performance is not susceptible to the number of beacon nodes (as long as it exceeds a certain threshold) and the network topology."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9348","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9348","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9348","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9349","fieldValue":" We show that significant simplicities can be obtained for the analysis of a network when link capacities are large enough to carry many flows. We develop a network decomposition approach in which network analysis can be greatly simplified. We prove that the queue length at the downstream queue converges to that of a single queue obtained by removing the upstream queue, as the capacity and the number of flows at the upstream queue increase. The precise modes of convergence vary depending on the type of input traffic, i.e., from regulated traffic arrivals to point process inputs. Our results thus help simplify network analysis by decomposing the original network into a simplified network in which all the nodes with large capacity have been eliminated. By means of extensive numerical investigation under various network scenarios, we demonstrate different aspects and implications of our network decomposition approach. Some of our findings are that our techniques perform well especially for the cases when: i) many flows are multiplexed as they enter the queue and\/or ii) departing flows are routed to different downstream nodes, i.e., no single flow dominates at any node."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9349","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
