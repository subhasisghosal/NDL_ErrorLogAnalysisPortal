Our goal is to design practical scheduling policies that can achieve provably good performance in terms of both throughput and delay, at a low complexity. While a class of $O(n^2.5 log n)-complexity hybrid scheduling policies is recently developed to guarantee both rate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic regime) and throughput optimality (in the general non-asymptotic setting), their practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we develop a simple greedy policy called Delay-based Server-Side-Greedy (D-SSG) with a lower complexity 2n2 + 2n, and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achieves throughput optimality, but also guarantees near-optimal asymptotic delay performance. Specifically, the rate-function of the delay-violation probability attained by D-SSG for any fixed integer delay threshold b > 0 is no smaller than the maximum achievable rate-function by any scheduling policy for threshold b -- 1. Thus, we are able to achieve a reduction in complexity (from O(n2.5 log n) of the hybrid policies to 2n2$ + 2n) with a minimal drop in the delay performance. More importantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexity than the hybrid policies that typically have a large constant factor hidden in the O(Â·) notation. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate our theoretical results in various scenarios. The simulation results show that in all scenarios we consider, D-SSG not only guarantees a near-optimal rate-function, but also empirically has a similar delay performance to the rate-function delay-optimal policies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10762","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10762","fieldValue":"OFDM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10762","fieldValue":"Achieving optimal throughput and near-optimal asymptotic delay performance in multichannel wireless networks with low complexity: a practical greedy scheduling policy"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10763","fieldValue":"Leung, Victor C M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10763","fieldValue":" In this paper, we investigate fundamental performance limits of cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based scheduling (CS) in downlink cellular networks. CS is known as an efficient scheduling method that can assign different time fractions for users or, equivalently, satisfy different channel access ratio (CAR) requirements of users while exploiting multiuser diversity. We first mathematically analyze the throughput characteristics of CS in arbitrary fading statistics and data rate functions. It is shown that the throughput gain of CS increases as the CAR of a user decreases or the number of users in a cell increases. For Nakagami-m fading channels, we obtain the average throughput in closed form and investigate the effects of the average signal-to-noise ratio, the shape parameter m, and the CAR on the throughput performance. In addition, we propose a threshold-based opportunistic feedback technique in order to reduce feedback overhead while satisfying the CAR requirements of users. We prove that the average feedback overhead of the proposed technique is upper-bounded by -- ln p, where p is the probability that no user satisfies the threshold condition in a cell. Finally, we adopt a novel fairness criterion, called qualitative fairness, which considers not only the quantity of the allocated resources to users, but also the quality of the resources. It is observed that CS provides a better qualitative fairness than other scheduling algorithms designed for controlling CARs of users."}
