Here we introduce a constrained form of this problem in which a partial mapping of a set of nodes (the \"seeds\") in one tree to a corresponding set of nodes in the other tree is given, and present efficient algorithms for both ordered and unordered trees. Whereas ordered tree matching based on seeded nodes has applications in pattern matching of RNA structures, unordered tree matching based on seeded nodes has applications in co-speciation and phylogeny reconciliation. The latter involves the solution of the planar tanglegram layout problem, for which a polynomial-time algorithm is given here."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4381","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4381","fieldValue":"Graph algorithms, Graph Theory, Discrete Mathematics, Mathematics of Computing, Trees, Biology and genetics, Life and Medical Sciences, Computer Applications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4381","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4381","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4382","fieldValue":" The gene-duplication problem is to infer a species supertree from gene trees that are confounded by complex histories of gene duplications. This problem is NP-hard and thus requires efficient and effective heuristics. Existing heuristics perform a stepwise search of the tree space, where each step is guided by an exact solution to an instance of a local search problem. We improve on the time complexity of the local search problem by a factor of n2= log n, where n is the size of the resulting species supertree. Typically, several thousand instances of the local search problem are solved throughout a stepwise heuristic search. Hence, our improvement makes the gene-duplication problem much more tractable for large-scale phylogenetic analyses."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4382","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4382","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4382","fieldValue":"ACM"}
