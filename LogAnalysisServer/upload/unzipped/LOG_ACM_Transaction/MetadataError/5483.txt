Many data compressors for modern genomic sequences rely heavily on finding repeats in the sequences. Small-scale and local repetitive structures are better understood than large and complex interspersed ones. The notion of maximal repeats captures all the repeats in the data in a space-efficient way. Prior work on maximal repeat finding used either a suffix tree or a suffix array along with other auxiliary data structures. Their space usage is 19-50 times the text size with the best engineering efforts, prohibiting their usability on massive data such as the whole human genome. We focus on finding all the maximal repeats from massive texts in a time- and space-efficient manner. Our technique uses the Burrows-Wheeler Transform and wavelet trees. For data sets consisting of natural language texts and protein data, the space usage of our method is no more than three times the text size. For genomic sequences stored using one byte per base, the space usage of our method is less than double the sequence size. Our space-efficient method keeps the timing performance fast. In fact, our method is orders of magnitude faster than the prior methods for processing massive texts such as the whole human genome, since the prior methods must use external memory. For the first time, our method enables a desktop computer with 8 GB internal memory (actual internal memory usage is less than 6 GB) to find all the maximal repeats in the whole human genome in less than 17 hours. We have implemented our method as general-purpose open-source software for public use."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4728","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4728","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4728","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4729","fieldValue":" High-throughput methods systematically measure the internal state of the entire cell, but powerful computational tools are needed to infer dynamics from their raw data. Therefore, we have developed a new computational method, Eigen-genomic System Dynamic-pattern Analysis (ESDA), which uses systems theory to infer dynamic parameters from a time series of gene expression measurements. As many genes are measured at a modest number of time points, estimation of the system matrix is underdetermined and traditional approaches for estimating dynamic parameters are ineffective; thus, ESDA uses the principle of dimensionality reduction to overcome the data imbalance. Since degradation rates are naturally confounded by self-regulation, our model estimates an effective degradation rate that is the difference between self-regulation and degradation. We demonstrate that ESDA is able to recover effective degradation rates with reasonable accuracy in simulation. We also apply ESDA to a budding yeast data set, and find that effective degradation rates are normally slower than experimentally measured degradation rates. Our results suggest that either self-regulation is widespread in budding yeast and that self-promotion dominates self-inhibition, or that self-regulation may be rare and that experimental methods for measuring degradation rates based on transcription arrest may severely overestimate true degradation rates in healthy cells."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4729","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4729","fieldValue":"Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, genome-wide gene expression, systems theory, singular value decomposition."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4729","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4729","fieldValue":"ACM"}
