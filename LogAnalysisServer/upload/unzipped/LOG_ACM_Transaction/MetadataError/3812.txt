At the same time, the acutely restricted and cost-sensitive nature of RFID tags rules out simple reuse of traditional security\/privacy solutions and calls for a new generation of extremely lightweight identification and authentication protocols. This article describes a universally composable security framework designed especially for RFID applications. We adopt RFID-specific setup, communication, and concurrency assumptions in a model that guarantees strong security, privacy, and availability properties. In particular, the framework supports modular deployment, which is most appropriate for ubiquitous applications. We also describe a set of simple, efficient, secure, and anonymous (untraceable) RFID identification and authentication protocols that instantiate the proposed framework. These protocols involve minimal interaction between tags and readers and place only a small computational load on the tag, and a light computational burden on the back-end server. We show that our protocols are provably secure within the proposed framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22275","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22275","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22276","fieldValue":"Brodley, Carla E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22276","fieldValue":" A covert channel can occur when an attacker finds and exploits a shared resource that is not designed to be a communication mechanism. A network covert channel operates by altering the timing of otherwise legitimate network traffic so that the arrival times of packets encode confidential data that an attacker wants to exfiltrate from a secure area from which she has no other means of communication. In this article, we present the first public implementation of an IP covert channel, discuss the subtle issues that arose in its design, and present a discussion on its efficacy. We then show that an IP covert channel can be differentiated from legitimate channels and present new detection measures that provide detection rates over 95&percnt;. We next take the simple step an attacker would of adding noise to the channel to attempt to conceal the covert communication. For these noisy IP covert timing channels, we show that our online detection measures can fail to identify the covert channel for noise levels higher than 10&percnt;. We then provide effective offline search mechanisms that identify the noisy channels."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22277","fieldValue":"ACM"}
