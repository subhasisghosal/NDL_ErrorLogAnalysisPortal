We introduce an interactive 3D extension of scatterplots called the Regression Cube (RC), which augments a 3D scatterplot with three facets on which the correlations between the two variables are revealed by sensitivity lines and sensitivity streamlines. The sensitivity visualization of local regression on the 2D projections provides insights about the shape of the data through its orientation and continuity cues. We also introduce a series of visual operations such as clustering, brushing, and selection supported in RC. By iteratively refining the selection of data points of interest, RC is able to reveal salient local correlation patterns that may otherwise remain hidden with a global analysis. We have demonstrated our system with two examples and a user-oriented evaluation, and we show how RCs enable interactive visual exploration of multidimensional datasets via a variety of classification and information retrieval tasks. A video demo of RC is available."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7189","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7189","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7190","fieldValue":" Recommender systems are firmly established as a standard technology for assisting users with their choices; however, little attention has been paid to the application of the user model in recommender systems, particularly the variability and noise that are an intrinsic part of human behavior and activity. To enable recommender systems to suggest items that are useful to a particular user, it can be essential to understand the user and his or her interactions with the system. These interactions typically manifest themselves as explicit and implicit user feedback that provides the key indicators for modeling usersâ\u20AC™ preferences for items and essential information for personalizing recommendations. In this article, we propose a classification framework for the use of explicit and implicit user feedback in recommender systems based on a set of distinct properties that include Cognitive Effort, User Model, Scale of Measurement, and Domain Relevance. We develop a set of comparison criteria for explicit and implicit user feedback to emphasize the key properties. Using our framework, we provide a classification of recommender systems that have addressed questions about user feedback, and we review state-of-the-art techniques to improve such user feedback and thereby improve the performance of the recommender system. Finally, we formulate challenges for future research on improvement of user feedback."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7190","fieldValue":"Modeling User Preferences in Recommender Systems: A Classification Framework for Explicit and Implicit User Feedback"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7190","fieldValue":"ACM"}
