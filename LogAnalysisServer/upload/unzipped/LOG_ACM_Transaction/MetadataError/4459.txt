In recent years the extreme growth of digital documents brought to light the need for novel approaches and more efficient techniques to improve the accuracy of IR systems to take into account real users' information needs. In this article we propose a novel metric to measure the semantic relatedness between words. Our approach is based on ontologies represented using a general knowledge base for dynamically building a semantic network. This network is based on linguistic properties and it is combined with our metric to create a measure of semantic relatedness. In this way we obtain an efficient strategy to rank digital documents from the Internet according to the user's interest domain. The proposed methods, metrics, and techniques are implemented in a system for information retrieval on the Web. Experiments are performed on a test set built using a directory service having information about analyzed documents. The obtained results compared to other similar systems show an effective improvement."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24399","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24399","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24400","fieldValue":" Increasingly, application developers seek the ability to search for existing Web services within large Internet-based repositories. The goal is to retrieve services that match the user's requirements. With the growing number of services in the repositories and the challenges of quickly finding the right ones, the need for clustering related services becomes evident to enhance search engine results with a list of similar services for each hit. In this article, a statistical clustering approach is presented that enhances an existing distributed vector space search engine for Web services with the possibility of dynamically calculating clusters of similar services for each hit in the list found by the search engine. The focus is laid on a very efficient and scalable clustering implementation that can handle very large service repositories. The evaluation with a large service repository demonstrates the feasibility and performance of the approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24401","fieldValue":" E-commerce Web site assessment helps determine whether a corporation's Web site is effectively designed to meet its business needs and whether the investment in Web sites is well justified. Due to the complexity of commercial Web sites that may include hundreds of Web pages for many big corporations, there may inevitably exist uncertainties when human assessors express their subjective judgments in assessing e-commerce Web sites. Fuzzy set theory is widely used to model uncertain and imprecise information in applications. Prior studies in e-commerce Web site assessment identified some key factors to assess commercial Web sites by using a numeric assessment scale that may not be effective and efficient in modeling uncertainty. This study intends to propose an e-commerce Web site assessment framework using a fuzzy classification approach. Based on this framework, a Web-based e-commerce assessment system was designed and developed, which can provide online assessment services to corporations on evaluating their commercial Web sites. An empirical investigation into assessing commercial Web sites of the top 120 Fortune Corporations of the USA was conducted using the developed online assessment system to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework. Research findings and implications are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24401","fieldValue":"ACM"}
