An un-annotated protein P and a GO annotation term T are represented by their characteristics. The characteristics of P are GO terms found within the abstracts of biomedical literature associated with P. The characteristics of T are GO terms found within the abstracts of biomedical literature associated with the proteins annotated with the function of T. Let F and F' be the important (dominant) sets of characteristic terms representing T and P, respectively. iPFPi would annotate P with the function of T, if F and F' are semantically similar. We constructed a novel semantic similarity measure that takes into consideration several factors, such as the dominance degree of each characteristic term t in set F based on its score, which is a value that reflects the dominance status of t relative to other characteristic terms, using pairwise beats and looses procedure. Every time a protein P is annotated with the function of T, iPFPi updates and optimizes the current scores of the characteristic terms for T based on the weights of the characteristic terms for P. Set F will be updated accordingly. Thus, the accuracy of predicting the function of T as the function of subsequent proteins improves. This prediction accuracy keeps improving over time iteratively through the cumulative weights of the characteristic terms representing proteins that are successively annotated with the function of T. We evaluated the quality of iPFPi by comparing it experimentally with two recent protein function prediction systems. Results showed marked improvement."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5214","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5214","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5214","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5215","fieldValue":" In the computational biology community, machine learning algorithms are key instruments for many applications, including the prediction of gene-functions based upon the available biomolecular annotations. Additionally, they may also be employed to compute similarity between genes or proteins. Here, we describe and discuss a software suite we developed to implement and make publicly available some of such prediction methods and a computational technique based upon Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), which leverages both inferred and available annotations to search for semantically similar genes. The suite consists of three components. BioAnnotationPredictor is a computational software module to predict new gene-functions based upon Singular Value Decomposition of available annotations. SimilBio is a Web module that leverages annotations available or predicted by BioAnnotationPredictor to discover similarities between genes via LSI. The suite includes also SemSim, a new Web service built upon these modules to allow accessing them programmatically. We integrated SemSim in the Bio Search Computing framework (http:\/\/www.bioinformatics.deib.polimi.it\/bio-seco\/seco\/), where users can exploit the Search Computing technology to run multi-topic complex queries on multiple integrated Web services. Accordingly, researchers may obtain ranked answers involving the computation of the functional similarity between genes in support of biomedical knowledge discovery."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5215","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5215","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5215","fieldValue":"ACM"}
