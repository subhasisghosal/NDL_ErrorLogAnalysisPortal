{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10034","fieldValue":" We consider a scheduled orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) wireless cellular network where the channels from the base-station to the n mobile users undergo flat fading. Spectral resources are to be divided among the users in order to maximize total user utility. We show that this problem can be cast as a nonlinear convex optimization problem, and describe an O(n) algorithm to solve it. Computational experiments show that the algorithm typically converges in around 25 iterations, where each iteration has a cost that is O(n), with a modest constant. When the algorithm starts from an initial resource allocation that is close to optimal, convergence typically takes even fewer iterations. Thus, the algorithm can efficiently track the optimal resource allocation as the channel conditions change due to fading. We also show how our techniques can be extended to solve resource allocation problems that arise in wideband networks with frequency selective fading and when the utility of a user is also a function of the resource allocations in the past."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10034","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10034","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10034","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10035","fieldValue":" Availability in connection-oriented service in networks has traditionally been \"all-or-nothing,\" i.e., when a failure occurs, a connection either is unprotected or fully protected. The differences in availability and cost between these two extremes can be quite high. A general framework for service availability will be presented that fills the gap. It is shown how network resources and cost are related to service parameters of the framework for networks that are bandwidth-efficient. In addition, a simple revenue model is presented and characterized, revealing when nontraditional service agreements may be attractive."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10035","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10035","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1012","fieldValue":" This paper shows how to make the latency of scanning a page in the Appel-Ellis-Li real-time garbage collector be proportional only to the number of object references on a page (the page size), instead of to the sum of the sizes of the objects referenced by the page.
