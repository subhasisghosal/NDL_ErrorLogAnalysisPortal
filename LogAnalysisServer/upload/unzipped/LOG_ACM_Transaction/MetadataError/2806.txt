However, this kind of entity type information is often insufficient for machines to understand the facts contained in the texts, thus precluding the possibility of implementing more advanced, intelligent applications, such as concept-based search. In this work, we try to create more refined thematic metadata inherent in texts. Based on Web resource mining, our approach acquires training corpora necessary to describe both the thematic categories and the metadata extracted from the texts. The approach then finds the corresponding relationships among them by means of categorization and thus generates thematic metadata for the textual data. Experimental results confirm the potential and wide adaptability of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19265","fieldValue":" We describe an efficient implementation of a hierarchy of algorithms for multiplication of dense matrices over the field with two elements $(F_2). In particular we present our implementationâ\u20AC\u201Din the M4RI libraryâ\u20AC\u201Dof Strassen-Winograd matrix multiplication and the â\u20ACœMethod of the Four Russians for Multiplicationâ\u20AC? (M4RM) and compare it against other available implementations. Good performance is demonstrated on AMD's Opteron processor and particulary good performance on Intel's Core 2 uo processor. The open-source M4RI library is available as a stand-alone package as well as part of the Sage mathematics system. In machine terms, addition in F2 is logical-XOR, and multiplication is logical-AND, thus a machine word of 64 bits allows one to operate on 64 elements of F2 in parallel: at most one CPU cycle for 64 parallel additions or multiplications. As such, element-wise operations over F2$ are relatively cheap. In fact, in this paper, we conclude that the actual bottlenecks are memory reads and writes and issues of data locality. We present our empirical findings in relation to minimizing these and give an analysis thereof."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19266","fieldValue":" Global polynomial approximation methods applied to piecewise continuous functions exhibit the well-known Gibbs phenomenon.
