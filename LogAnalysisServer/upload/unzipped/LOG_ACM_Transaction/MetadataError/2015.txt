{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16893","fieldValue":" We present an approach to detailed reconstruction of complex real-world scenes with a handheld commodity range sensor. The user moves the sensor freely through the environment and images the scene. An offline registration and integration pipeline produces a detailed scene model. To deal with the complex sensor trajectories required to produce detailed reconstructions with a consumer-grade sensor, our pipeline detects points of interest in the scene and preserves detailed geometry around them while a global optimization distributes residual registration errors through the environment. Our results demonstrate that detailed reconstructions of complex scenes can be obtained with a consumer-grade camera."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16894","fieldValue":" We address the fundamental challenge of scalability for real-time volumetric surface reconstruction methods. We design a memory efficient, hierarchical data structure for commodity graphics hardware, which supports live reconstruction of large-scale scenes with fine geometric details. Our sparse data structure fuses overlapping depth maps from a moving depth camera into a single volumetric representation, from which detailed surface models are extracted. Our hierarchy losslessly streams data bidirectionally between GPU and host, allowing for unbounded reconstructions. Our pipeline, comprised of depth map post-processing, camera pose estimation, volumetric fusion, surface extraction, and streaming, runs entirely in real-time. We experimentally demonstrate that a shallow hierarchy with relatively large branching factors yields the best memory\/speed tradeoff, consuming an order of magnitude less memory than a regular grid. We compare an implementation of our data structure to existing methods and demonstrate higher-quality reconstructions on a variety of large-scale scenes, all captured in real-time."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16894","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16894","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16894","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16895","fieldValue":"Wong, Sai-Keung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16895","fieldValue":"Lin, Wen-Chieh"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16895","fieldValue":"Hung, Chun-Hung"}
