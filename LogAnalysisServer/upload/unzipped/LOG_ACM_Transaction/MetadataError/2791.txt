Several random graph models have been proposed that capture key properties of real-life networks. These models provide realistic, parametrized matrices for testing linear system and eigenvalue solvers. CONTEST (CONtrollable TEST matrices) is a random network toolbox for MATLAB that implements nine models. The models produce unweighted directed or undirected graphs; that is, symmetric or unsymmetric matrices with elements equal to zero or one. They have one or more parameters that affect features such as sparsity and characteristic pathlength and all can be of arbitrary dimension. Utility functions are supplied for rewiring, adding extra shortcuts and subsampling in order to create further classes of networks. Other utilities convert the adjacency matrices into real-valued coefficient matrices for naturally arising computational tasks that reduce to sparse linear system and eigenvalue problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19232","fieldValue":"Davis, Timothy A"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19232","fieldValue":"Hager, William W"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19232","fieldValue":" The supernodal method for sparse Cholesky factorization represents the factor L as a set of supernodes, each consisting of a contiguous set of columns of L with identical nonzero pattern. A conventional supernode is stored as a dense submatrix. While this is suitable for sparse Cholesky factorization where the nonzero pattern of L does not change, it is not suitable for methods that modify a sparse Cholesky factorization after a low-rank change to A (an update\/downdate, Ä\u20AC = A Â± $WW^T$). Supernodes merge and split apart during an update\/downdate. Dynamic supernodes are introduced which allow a sparse Cholesky update\/downdate to obtain performance competitive with conventional supernodal methods. A dynamic supernodal solver is shown to exceed the performance of the conventional (BLAS-based) supernodal method for solving triangular systems. These methods are incorporated into CHOLMOD, a sparse Cholesky factorization and update\/downdate package which forms the basis of x = A\\b MATLAB when A is sparse and symmetric positive definite."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19232","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19232","fieldValue":"ACM"}
