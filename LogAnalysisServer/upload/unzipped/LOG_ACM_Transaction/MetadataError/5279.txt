In the face of thesenew data, we address the need to find a consensus map â\u20AC\u201D a map that combines the information from multiple partialand possibly inconsistent input maps. We model eachinput map as a partial order and formulate the consensusproblem as finding a median partial order. Finding themedian of multiple total orders (preferences or rankings)is a well studied problem in social choice. We choose tofind the median using the weighted symmetric differencedistance, a more general version of both the symmetricdifference distance and the Kemeny distance. Finding amedian order using this distance is NP-hard. We showthat for our chosen weight assignment, a median ordersatisfies the positive responsiveness, extended Condorcet,and unanimity criteria. Our solution involves finding themaximum acyclic subgraph of a weighted directed graph.We present a method that dynamically switches betweenan exact branch and bound algorithm and a heuristicalgorithm, and show that for real data from closely relatedorganisms, an exact median can often be found.We presentexperimental results using seven populations of the cropplant Zea mays."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4348","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4348","fieldValue":"Genetic map, median order, path and circuit problems, Kemeny distance, symmetric difference distance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4348","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4348","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4349","fieldValue":"Bar-Joseph, Ziv"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4349","fieldValue":" Static expression experiments analyze samples from many individuals. These samples are often snapshots of the progression of a certain disease such as cancer. This raises an intriguing question: Can we determine a temporal order for these samples? Such an ordering can lead to better understanding of the dynamics of the disease and to the identification of genes associated with its progression. In this paper we formally prove, for the first time, that under a model for the dynamics of the expression levels of a single gene, it is indeed possible to recover the correct ordering of the static expression datasets by solving an instance of the traveling salesman problem (TSP). In addition, we devise an algorithm that combines a TSP heuristic and probabilistic modeling for inferring the underlying temporal order of the microarray experiments. This algorithm constructs probabilistic continuous curves to represent expression profiles leading to accurate temporal reconstruction for human data. Applying our method to cancer expression data we show that the ordering derived agrees well with survival duration. A classifier that utilizes this ordering improves upon other classifiers suggested for this task. The set of genes displaying consistent behavior for the determined ordering are enriched for genes associated with cancer progression."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4349","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4349","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4349","fieldValue":"ACM"}
