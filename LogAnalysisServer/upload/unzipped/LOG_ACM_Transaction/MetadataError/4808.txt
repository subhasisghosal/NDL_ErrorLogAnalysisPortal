{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3459","fieldValue":" In two experiments, visual cues from gesture control of spatialization were found to affect auditory movement perception depending on the identifiability of auditory motion trajectories, the congruency of audiovisual stimulation, the sensory focus of attention, and the attentional process involved. Visibility of the performerâ\u20AC™s gestures improved spatial audio trajectory identification, but it shifted the listenersâ\u20AC™ attention to vision, impairing auditory motion encoding in the case of incongruent stimulation. On the other hand, selectively directing attention to audition resulted in interference from the visual cues for acoustically ambiguous trajectories. Auditory motion information was poorly preserved when dividing attention between auditory and visual movement feedback from performance gestures. An auditory focus of attention is a listener strategy that maximizes performance, due to the improvement caused by congruent visual stimulation and its robustness to interference from incongruent stimulation for acoustically unambiguous trajectories. Attentional strategy and auditory motion calibration are two aspects that need to be considered when employing gesture control of spatialization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3459","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3459","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25460","fieldValue":" In this article we propose a novel, robust, and high-capacity watermarking method for 3D meshes with arbitrary connectivities in the spatial domain based on affine invariants. Given a 3D mesh model, a watermark is embedded as affine-invariant length ratios of one diagonal segment to the residing diagonal intersected by the other one in a coplanar convex quadrilateral. In the extraction process, a watermark is recovered by combining all the watermark pieces embedded in length ratios through majority voting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the robustness, high computational efficiency, high capacity, and affine-transformation-invariant characteristics of the proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25460","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25460","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25461","fieldValue":" Audio recordings should be authenticated before they are used as evidence. Although audio watermarking and signature are widely applied for authentication, these two techniques require accessing the original audio before it is published. Passive authentication is necessary for digital audio, especially for the most popular audio format: MP3. In this article, we propose a passive approach to detect forgeries of MP3 audio. During the process of MP3 encoding the audio samples are divided into frames, and thus each frame has its own frame offset after encoding. Forgeries lead to the breaking of framing grids. So the frame offset is a good indication for locating forgeries, and it can be retrieved by the identification of the quantization characteristic. In this way, the doctored positions can be automatically located. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in detecting some common forgeries, such as deletion, insertion, substitution, and splicing. Even when the bit rate is as low as 32 kbps, the detection rate is above 99&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25461","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25461","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25462","fieldValue":" Collusion attack is a cost-efficient attack for digital fingerprinting. In this article, we propose a novel collusion attack strategy, Iterative Optimization Collusion Attack (IOCA), which is based upon the gradient attack and the principle of informed watermark embedding. We evaluate the performance of the proposed collusion attack strategy in defeating four typical fingerprinting schemes under a well-constructed evaluation framework. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy performs more effectively than the gradient attack, and adopting no more than three fingerprinted copies can sufficiently collapse examined fingerprinting schemes. Meanwhile, the content resulted from the proposed attack still preserves high perceptual quality."}
