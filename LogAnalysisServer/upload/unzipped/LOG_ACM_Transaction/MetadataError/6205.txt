In this article, a video processing algorithm is dynamically mapped onto a new parallel reconfigurable computing (PRC) architecture which consists of multiple dynamic reconfigurable computing (DRC) units. First, we construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent video coding algorithms in which motion estimation is the focus. A novel parallel partition approach is then proposed to map motion estimation DAG onto the multiple DRC units in a PRC system. This partitioning algorithm is capable of design optimization of parallel processing reconfigurable systems for a given number of processing elements in different search ranges. This speeds up the video processing with minimum sacrifice."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6547","fieldValue":"Parallel Reconfigurable Computing-Based Mapping Algorithm for Motion Estimation in Advanced Video Coding"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6548","fieldValue":"Surs, Jorge A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6548","fieldValue":" In this article, the RapidRadio framework for signal classification and receiver deployment is discussed. The framework is a productivity-enhancing tool that reduces the required knowledge base for implementing a receiver on an FPGA-based SDR platform. The ultimate objective of this framework is to identify unknown signals and to build FPGA-based receivers capable of receiving them. RapidRadio divides the process of radio creation into two phases; the analysis phase and radio synthesis phase. The analysis phase guides the user through the process of classifying an unknown signal and determining its modulation scheme and parameters, resulting in a radio receiver model. In the second phase, this model is transformed into a functional receiver in an FPGA-based platform."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6548","fieldValue":"FPGA"}
