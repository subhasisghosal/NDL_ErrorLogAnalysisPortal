Because textures are maintained in the shadowless image after the extraction process, our approach produces some of the best results to date among shadow removal techniques. Using the image formation equation typical of computer vision, we advocate a new model for shadow formation where shadow effect is understood as light attenuation instead of a mixture of two colors governed by the conventional matting equation. This leads to a new shadow equation with fewer unknowns to solve, where a three-channel shadow matte and a shadowless image are considered in our optimization. Our problem is formulated as one of energy minimization guided by user-supplied hints in the form of a quadmap which can be specified easily by the user. This formulation allows for robust shadow matte extraction while maintaining texture in the shadowed region by considering color transfer, texture gradient, and shadow smoothness. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in shadow removal, image matting, and compositing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15753","fieldValue":" Lighting is a fundamental aspect of computer cinematography that involves the placement and configuration of lights to establish mood and enhance storytelling. This process is labor intensive as artists repeatedly adjust the parameters of a large set of complex lights to achieve a desired effect. Typical lighting controls affect the final image indirectly, requiring a large number of trials to obtain a suitable result. We present an interactive system wherein an artist paints desired lighting effects directly into the scene, and the computer solves for parameters that achieve the desired look. The artist can paint color, light shape, shadows, highlights, and reflections using a suite of tools designed for painting light. Our system matches these effects using a nonlinear optimizer made robust by a combination of initial estimates, system design, and user-guided optimization. In contrast, previous work on painting light has not permitted the lights to move, allowing for linear optimization but preventing its use in computer cinematography. To demonstrate our approach we lit several scenes, mainly using a direct illumination renderer designed for computer animation, but also including two other rendering styles. We show that painting interfaces can quickly produce high quality lighting setups, easing the lighting artist's workflow."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1175","fieldValue":" Network applications are increasingly required to be autonomous, scalable, adaptive to dynamic changes in the network, and survivable against partial system failures. Based on the observation that various biological systems have already satisfied these requirements, this article proposes and evaluates a biologically-inspired framework that makes network applications to be autonomous, scalable, adaptive, and survivable. With the proposed framework, called iNet, each network application is designed as a decentralized group of software agents, analogous to a bee colony (application) consisting of multiple bees (agents). Each agent provides a particular functionality of a network application, and implements biological behaviors such as reproduction, migration, energy exchange, and death. iNet is designed after the mechanisms behind how the immune system detects antigens (e.g., viruses) and produces specific antibodies to eliminate them. It models a set of environment conditions (e.g., network traffic and resource availability) as an antigen and an agent behavior (e.g., migration) as an antibody. iNet allows each agent to autonomously sense its surrounding environment conditions (an antigen) to evaluate whether it adapts well to the sensed environment, and if it does not, adaptively perform a behavior (an antibody) suitable for the environment conditions. In iNet, a configuration of antibodies is encoded as a set of genes, and antibodies evolve via genetic operations such as crossover and mutation. Empirical measurement results show that iNet is lightweight enough. Simulation results show that agents adapt to dynamic and heterogeneous network environments by evolving their antibodies across generations. The results also show that iNet allows agents to scale to workload volume and network size and to survive partial link failures in the network."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1175","fieldValue":"An immunologically-inspired autonomic framework for self-organizing and evolvable network applications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1175","fieldValue":"ACM"}
