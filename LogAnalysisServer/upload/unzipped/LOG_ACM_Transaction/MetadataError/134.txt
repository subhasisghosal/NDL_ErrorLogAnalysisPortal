These are conservative extensions of classical automata and logics defining the regular languages on finite alphabets. Specifically, we consider register and pebble automata, and extensions of first-order logic and monadic second-order logic. For each type of automaton we consider one-way and two-way variants, as well as deterministic, nondeterministic, and alternating control. We investigate the expressiveness and complexity of the automata and their connection to the logics, as well as standard decision problems. Some of our results answer open questions of Kaminski and Francez on register automata."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11407","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11408","fieldValue":" Value passing process algebras with infinite data domains need to be equipped with symbolic semantic models in order for their analysis to be possible. This means that appropriate symbolic models and the related verification algorithms must be developed, together with suitable semantic rules mapping the value passing process descriptions to such symbolic models. In this article, we first introduce the model of the symbolic transition graphs with lookahead assignment (STGLAs), a variant of the symbolic transition graphs with assignment (STGAs) of Lin that can undergo to the strong, weak and observational bisimulation equivalence checking algorithms of Li and Chen. We then define a set of symbolic semantic rules that map a useful fragment of value passing CCS to finite STGLAs without making any assumption about the variable names. We demonstrate that the symbolic semantic rules are correct with respect to both the usual concrete semantic rules and the novel issue of the assignment application order. Finally, we prove that, for the considered fragment of value passing CCS, the STGLAs produced by the symbolic semantic rules are optimal with respect to a certain compactness criterion, thus improving on the symbolic models and the semantic rules previously proposed in the literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11409","fieldValue":"Smaus, Jan-Georg"}
