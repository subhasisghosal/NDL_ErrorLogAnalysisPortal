{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10084","fieldValue":" Aggregate traffic loads and topology in multihop wireless networks may vary slowly, permitting MAC protocols to \"learn\" how to spatially coordinate and adapt contention patterns. Such an approach could reduce contention, leading to better throughput. To that end, we propose a family of MAC scheduling algorithms and demonstrate general conditions, which, if satisfied, ensure lattice rate optimality (i.e., achieving any rate-point on a uniform discrete lattice within the throughput region). This general framework enables the design of MAC protocols that meet various objectives and conditions. In this paper, as instances of such a lattice-rate-optimal family, we propose distributed, synchronous contention-based scheduling algorithms that: 1) are lattice-rate-optimal under both the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-based and graph-based interference models; 2) do not require node location information; and 3) only require three-stage RTS\/CTS message exchanges for contention signaling. Thus, the protocols are amenable to simple implementation and may be robust to network dynamics such as topology and load changes. Finally, we propose a heuristic, which also belongs to the proposed lattice-rate-optimal family of protocols and achieves faster convergence, leading to a better transient throughput."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10084","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10084","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10084","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10085","fieldValue":" This paper presents \"Self-Chord,\" a peer-to-peer (P2P) system that inherits the ability of Chord-like structured systems for the construction and maintenance of an overlay of peers, but features enhanced functionalities deriving from ant-inspired algorithms, such as autonomous behavior, self-organization, and capacity to adapt to a changing environment. As opposed to the structured P2P systems deployed so far, resource indexing and placement is uncorrelated with network structure and topology, and resource keys are organized and managed by self-organizing mobile agents through simple local operations driven by probabilistic choices. Self-Chord has three main features that are particularly advantageous in Grid and Cloud Computing: 1) it is possible to give a semantic meaning to keys, which enables the execution of range queries; 2) the keys are fairly distributed over the peers, thus improving the balancing of storage responsibilities; 3) maintenance load is also limited because it is not necessary to reassign keys when new peers or resources are added to the system--the mobile agents will spontaneously reorganize the keys. The efficiency and effectiveness of Self-Chord were assessed both with a simulation framework and with an analytical model inspired by fluid dynamics."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10085","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10085","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10085","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10086","fieldValue":"Bremler-Barr, Anat"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10086","fieldValue":" Ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) devices are increasingly used for performing high-speed packet classification. A TCAM consists of an associative memory that compares a search key in parallel against all entries. TCAMs may suffer from error events that cause ternary cells to change their value to any symbol in the ternary alphabet {\"0\",\"1\",\"*\"}. Due to their parallel access feature, standard error detection schemes are not directly applicable to TCAMs; an additional difficulty is posed by the special semantic of the \"*\" symbol. This paper introduces PEDS, a novel parallel error detection scheme that locates the erroneous entries in a TCAM device. PEDS is based on applying an error-detecting code to each TCAM entry and utilizing the parallel capabilities of the TCAM by simultaneously checking the correctness of multiple TCAM entries. A key feature of PEDS is that the number of TCAM lookup operations required to locate all errors depends on the number of symbols per entry in a manner that is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the number of TCAM entries. For large TCAM devices, a specific instance of PEDS requires only 200 lookups for 100-symbol entries, while a naive approach may need hundreds of thousands of lookups. PEDS allows flexible and dynamic selection of tradeoff points between robustness, space complexity, and number of lookups."}
