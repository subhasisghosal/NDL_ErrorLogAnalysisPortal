In this study, we focus on the problem of stemming several resource-poor languages from Eastern India, viz., Assamese, Bengali, Bishnupriya Manipuri and Bodo. While Assamese, Bengali and Bishnupriya Manipuri are Indo-Aryan, Bodo is a Tibeto-Burman language. We design a rule-based approach to remove suffixes from words. To reduce over-stemming and under-stemming errors, we introduce a dictionary of frequent words. We observe that, for these languages a dominant amount of suffixes are single letters creating problems during suffix stripping. As a result, we introduce an HMM-based hybrid approach to classify the mis-matched last character. For each word, the stem is extracted by calculating the most probable path in four HMM states. At each step we measure the stemming accuracy for each language. We obtain 94&percnt; accuracy for Assamese and Bengali and 87&percnt;, and 82&percnt; for Bishnupriya Manipuri and Bodo, respectively, using the hybrid approach. We compare our work with Morfessor [Creutz and Lagus 2005]. As of now, there is no reported work on stemming for Bishnupriya Manipuri and Bodo. Our results on Assamese and Bengali show significant improvement over prior published work [Sarkar and Bandyopadhyay 2008; Sharma et al. 2002, 2003]."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3046","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3046","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21471","fieldValue":"Walle, Rik van de"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21471","fieldValue":" Wyner-Ziv video coding constitutes an alluring paradigm for visual sensor networks, offering efficient video compression with low complexity encoding characteristics. This work presents a novel hash-driven Wyner-Ziv video coding architecture for visual sensors, implementing the principles of successively refined Wyner-Ziv coding. To this end, so-called side-information refinement levels are constructed for a number of grouped frequency bands of the discrete cosine transform. The proposed codec creates side-information by means of an original overlapped block motion estimation and pixel-based multihypothesis prediction technique, specifically built around the pursued refinement strategy. The quality of the side-information generated at every refinement level is successively improved, leading to gradually enhanced Wyner-Ziv coding performance. Additionally, this work explores several temporal prediction structures, including a new hierarchical unidirectional prediction structure, providing both temporal scalability and low delay coding. Experimental results include a thorough evaluation of our novel Wyner-Ziv codec, assessing the impact of the proposed successive refinement scheme and the supported temporal prediction structures for a wide range of hash configurations and group of pictures sizes. The results report significant compression gains with respect to benchmark systems in Wyner-Ziv video coding (e.g., up to 42.03&percnt; over DISCOVER) as well as versus alternative state-of-the-art schemes refining the side-information."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21471","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21471","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21472","fieldValue":"Shin, Paul J"}
