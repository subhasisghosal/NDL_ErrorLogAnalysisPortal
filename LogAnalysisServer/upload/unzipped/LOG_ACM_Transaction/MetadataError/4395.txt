Our motivation builds on the assumption that human interpretation should lead to the most accurate assessment of sentiment in text. We call this automated process Human Reading for Sentiment (HRS). Previous research in sentiment analysis has produced many frameworks that can fit one or more of the HRS aspects; however, none of these methods has addressed them all in one approach. HRS provides a meta-framework for developing new sentiment analysis methods or improving existing ones. The proposed framework provides a theoretical lens for zooming in and evaluating aspects of any sentiment analysis method to identify gaps for improvements towards matching the human reading process. Key steps in HRS include the automation of humans low-level and high-level cognitive text processing. This methodology paves the way towards the integration of psychology with computational linguistics and machine learning to employ models of pragmatics and discourse analysis for sentiment analysis. HRS is tested with two state-of-the-art methods; one is based on feature engineering, and the other is based on deep learning. HRS highlighted the gaps in both methods and showed improvements for both."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24165","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24165","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24166","fieldValue":"Wen, Ji-Rong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24166","fieldValue":" With the pervasiveness of location-based social networks, it becomes increasingly important to consider the social characteristics of locations shared among persons. Several studies have been proposed to infer social strength by using trajectory similarity. However, these studies have two major shortcomings. First, they rely on the explicit co-occurrence of check-in locations. In this situation, a user pair of two friends who seldom share common locations or a user pair of two strangers who heavily share common visited locations will receive an unreliable estimation of the real social strength between them. Second, these studies do not consider how the overall trajectory patterns of users change with the varying of living styles. In this article, we propose a probabilistic generative model to mine latent lifestyle-related patterns from human trajectory data for inferring social strength. It can automatically learn functionality topics consisting of locations with similar service functions and transition probabilities over the set of functionality topics. Furthermore, a lifestyle is modeled as a unique transition probability matrix over the set of functionality topics. A user has a preference distribution over the set of lifestyles, and he or she is able to select over multiple lifestyles to adapt to different living contexts. The learned lifestyle-related patterns are subsequently used as features in a supervised learner for both strength estimation and link prediction. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24166","fieldValue":"A Probabilistic Lifestyle-Based Trajectory Model for Social Strength Inference from Human Trajectory Data"}
