In contrast to previous systems, SWORD allows users to describe desired resources as a topology of interconnected groups with required intragroup, intergroup, and per-node characteristics, along with the utility that the application derives from specified ranges of metric values. This design gives users the flexibility to find geographically distributed resources for applications that are sensitive to both node and network characteristics, and allows the system to rank acceptable configurations based on their quality for that application. Rather than evaluating a single implementation of SWORD, we explore a variety of architectural designs that deliver the required functionality in a scalable and highly available manner. We discuss the trade-offs of using a centralized architecture as compared to a fully decentralized design to perform wide-area resource discovery. To summarize our results, we found that a centralized architecture based on 4-node server cluster sites at network-peering facilities outperforms a decentralized DHT-based resource discovery infrastructure with respect to query latency for all but the smallest number of sites. However, although a centralized architecture shows significant promise in stable environments, we find that our decentralized implementation has acceptable performance and also benefits from the DHT's self-healing properties in more volatile environments. We evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of centralized and distributed resource discovery architectures on 1000 hosts in emulation and on approximately 200 PlanetLab nodes spread across the Internet."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24386","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24386","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24387","fieldValue":" Service discovery and service aggregation are two crucial issues in the emerging area of service-oriented computing (SOC). We propose a new technique for the discovery of (Web) services that accounts for the need of composing several services to satisfy a client query. The proposed algorithm makes use of OWL-S ontologies, and explicitly returns the sequence of atomic process invocations that the client must perform in order to achieve the desired result. When no full match is possible, the algorithm features a flexible matching by returning partial matches and by suggesting additional inputs that would produce a full match."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24388","fieldValue":" Semantics exhibits diversity in the real world, mental abstraction world, document world, and machine world. Studying mappings between different forms of semantics helps unveil the uniformity in the diversity. This article investigates the mappings between three typical semantic models: the Web ontology language (OWL), relational database model, and resource space model (a classification-based semantic model). By establishing mappings between the semantic primitives of the three models, we study the mapping from OWL description onto resource space and analyze the normal forms of the generated resource space. Mapping back from resource space onto OWL description is then discussed. Further, we investigate the mapping between OWL description and relational database, as well as the mapping between relational database and resource space. Normal forms of the generated relational tables are analyzed. To support advanced applications on the future Web, we suggest integrating the resource space, OWL, and databases to form a powerful semantic platform that enables different semantic models to enhance each other."}
