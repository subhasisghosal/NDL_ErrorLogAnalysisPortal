Communication performance can be improved significantly by adaptive transmissions based on the quality of received signals, i.e., the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). However, for multihop wireless communications, most link scheduling schemes have been developed under simplified interference models that do not account for accumulative interference and cannot fully exploit the recent advances in PHY-layer communication theory. This paper focuses on developing link scheduling schemes that can achieve optimal performance under the SINR model. One key idea is to treat an adaptive wireless link as multiple parallel virtual links with different signal quality, building on which we develop throughput-optimal scheduling schemes using a two-stage queueing structure in conjunction with recently developed carrier-sensing techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a novel three-way handshake to ensure, in a distributed manner, that all transmitting links satisfy their SINR requirements. We evaluate the proposed schemes through rigorous analysis and simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10638","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10638","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10638","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10639","fieldValue":" Datacenter networking has gained increasing popularity in the past few years. While researchers paid considerable efforts to enhance the performance and scalability of datacenter networks, achieving reliable data delivery in these emerging networks with misbehaving routers and switches received far less attention. Unfortunately, documented incidents of router compromise underscore that the capability to identify adversarial routers and switches is an imperative and practical need rather than merely a theoretical exercise. To this end, data-plane fault localization (FL) aims to identify faulty links and is an effective means of achieving high network availability. However, existing secure FL protocols assume that the source node knows the entire outgoing path that delivers the source node's packets and that the path is static and long-lived. These assumptions are invalidated by the dynamic traffic patterns and agile load balancing commonly seen in modern datacenter networks. We propose the first secure FL protocol, DFL, with no requirements on path durability or the source node knowing the outgoing paths. Through a core technique we named delayed function disclosure, DFL incurs little communication overhead and a small, constant router state independent of the network size or the number of flows traversing a router."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10639","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10639","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10639","fieldValue":"ACM"}
