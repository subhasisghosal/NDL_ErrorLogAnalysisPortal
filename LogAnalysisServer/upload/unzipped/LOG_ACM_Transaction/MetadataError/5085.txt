We train the parameters with mixture data in which the sources are competing with the same average signal power. Compared with factorial hidden Markov model (HMM) baselines, the CRF settings require fewer training mixture data to improve objective speech quality measures and speech recognition accuracy of the reconstructed sources, when mixing ratios of training and testing mixture data are matched. The CRF settings also handle minor mixing ratio mismatch after adjusting the gain factors of the sources with non-linear mappings inspired from the mixture-maximization model. When the mixing ratio mismatch further increases such that the speech mixture is dominated by only one source, factorial HMM finally catches up with and performs better than the CRF settings due to improved model accuracy. We also develop a convex statistical inference simplification based on linear-chain CRFs. The simplification achieves the same performance level as the original CRF settings after integrating additional observations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3872","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3872","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3873","fieldValue":" Multizone soundfield reproduction over an extended spatial region is a challenging problem in acoustic signal processing. We introduce a method of reproducing a multizone soundfield within a desired region in reverberant environments. It is based on the identification of the acoustic transfer function (ATF) from the loudspeaker over the desired reproduction region using a limited number of microphone measurements. We assume that the soundfield is sparse in the domain of planewave decomposition and identify the ATF using sparse methods. The estimates of the ATFs are then used to derive the optimal least-squares solution for the loudspeaker filters that minimize the reproduction error over the entire reproduction region. Simulations confirm that the method leads to a significantly reduced number of required microphones for accurate multizone sound reproduction, while it also facilitates the reproduction over a wide frequency range. Practical experiments are used to verify the sparse planewave representation of the reverberant soundfield in a real-world listening environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3873","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3873","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1295","fieldValue":" Structural relations established among agents influence the performance of decentralized service discovery process in multiagent systems. Moreover, distributed systems should be able to adapt their structural relations to changes in environmental conditions. In this article, we present a service-oriented multiagent systems, where agents initially self-organize their structural relations based on the similarity of their services. During the service discovery process, agents integrate a mechanism that facilitates the self-organization of their structural relations to adapt the structure of the system to the service demand. This mechanism facilitates the task of decentralized service discovery and improves its performance. Each agent has local knowledge about its direct neighbors and the queries received during discovery processes. With this information, an agent is able to analyze its structural relations and decide when it is more appropriate to modify its direct neighbors and select the most suitable acquaintances to replace them. The experimental evaluation shows how this self-organization mechanism improves the overall performance of the service discovery process in the system when the service demand changes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1295","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1295","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3874","fieldValue":" Considering that multiple talkers may appear simultaneously, a time-frequency (TF) masking based random finite set (RFS) particle filtering (PF) method is developed for multiple acoustic source detection and tracking. The time-delay of arrival (TDOA) measurements of multiple sources are extracted by using a time-frequency masking technique, by which each source's TF bins are clustered and separated in a joint gain-ratio and time-delay histogram. Since a joint detection and tracking problem is considered, both source positions and source numbers are time-varying and need to be estimated. The tracker is built within a RFS Bayesian filtering framework. Essentially, an RFS process is used to characterize the source dynamics that include source appearance\/dissappearance and motion trajectories. Latent variables are also introduced to indicate source dynamics and measurement-source associations. Subsequently, a Rao-Blackwellization PF technique is employed so that the source position state can be marginalized and only the latent variables are estimated by using the PF. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that hypothesis-pruning is formulated in a full probabilistic sense. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated in real speech recordings as well as in simulated room environments."}
