These digital contents are automatically managed by different kinds of digital library management systems and more generally by different kinds of information management systems. Even though this topic has already been partially studied by other researchers, the previous research work on annotations has left many open issues. These issues concern the lack of clarity about what an annotation is, what its features are, and how it is used. These issues are mainly due to the fact that models and systems for annotations have only been developed for specific purposes. As a result, there is only a fragmentary picture of the annotation and its management, and this is tied to specific contexts of use and lacks-general validity. The aim of the article is to provide a unified and integrated picture of the annotation, ranging from defining what an annotation is to providing a formal model. The key ideas of the model are: the distinction between the meaning and the sign of the annotation, which represent the semantics and the materialization of an annotation, respectively; the clear formalization of the temporal dimension involved with annotations; and the introduction of a distributed hypertext between digital contents and annotations. Therefore, the proposed formal model captures both syntactic and semantic aspects of the annotations. Furthermore, it is built on previously existing models and may be seen as an extension of them."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23950","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23951","fieldValue":" Collaborative filtering (CF) is a personalization technology that generates recommendations for users based on others' evaluations. CF is used by numerous e-commerce Web sites for providing personalized recommendations. Although much research has focused on refining collaborative filtering algorithms, little is known about the effects of user and domain characteristics on the accuracy of collaborative filtering systems. In this study, the effects of two factorsâ\u20AC\u201Dproduct domain and users' search modeâ\u20AC\u201Don the accuracy of CF are investigated. The effects of those factors are tested using data collected from two experiments in two different product domains, and from two large CF datasets, EachMovie and Book-Crossing. The study shows that the search mode of the users strongly influences the accuracy of the recommendations. CF works better when users look for specific information than when they search for general information. The accuracy drops significantly when data from different modes are mixed. The study also shows that CF is more accurate for knowledge domains than for consumer product domains. The results of this study imply that for more accurate recommendations, collaborative filtering systems should be able to identify and handle users' mode of search, even within the same domain and user group."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23951","fieldValue":"Does a one-size recommendation system fit all? the effectiveness of collaborative filtering based recommendation systems across different domains and search modes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23951","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23952","fieldValue":" Due to the existence of large numbers of legacy documents (such as old books and newspapers), improving retrieval effectiveness for OCR'ed documents continues to be an important problem. This article compares the effect of OCR error correction with and without language modeling and the effect of query garbling with weighted structured queries on the retrieval of OCR degraded Arabic documents. The results suggest that moderate error correction does not yield statistically significant improvement in retrieval effectiveness when indexing and searching using n-grams. Also, reversing error correction models to perform query garbling in conjunction with weighted structured queries yields improved retrieval effectiveness. Lastly, using very good error correction that utilizes language modeling yields the best improvement in retrieval effectiveness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23952","fieldValue":"ACM"}
