Current work on healthcare informatics is highly interdisciplinary involving methodologies from computing, engineering, information science, behavior science, management science, social science, as well as many different areas in medicine and public health. Three major tracks, (i) systems, (ii) analytics, and (iii) human factors, can be identified. The systems track focuses on healthcare system architecture, framework, design, engineering, and application; the analytics track emphasizes data\/information processing, retrieval, mining, analytics, as well as knowledge discovery; the human factors track targets the understanding of users or context, interface design, and user studies of healthcare applications. In this article, we discuss some of the latest development and introduce several articles selected for this special issue. We envision that the development of computing-oriented healthcare informatics research will continue to grow rapidly. The integration of different disciplines to advance the healthcare and wellbeing of our society will also be accelerated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8196","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8196","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8197","fieldValue":"McClean, Sally"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8197","fieldValue":" In this article, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is applied for modeling the throughput of emergency departments via available time-series data. The dynamics of emergency department throughput is developed and evaluated, for the first time, as a stochastic dynamic model that consists of the noisy measurement and first-order autoregressive (AR) stochastic dynamic process. By using the EM algorithm, the model parameters, the actual throughput, as well as the noise intensity, can be identified simultaneously. Four real-world time series collected from an emergency department in West London are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced algorithm. Several quantitative indices are proposed to evaluate the inferred models. The simulation shows that the identified model fits the data very well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8197","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8197","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8198","fieldValue":"Gunter, Carl A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8198","fieldValue":" In electronic medical record (EMR) systems, administrators often provide EMR users with broad access privileges, which may leave the system vulnerable to misuse and abuse. Given that patient care is based on a coordinated workflow, we hypothesize that care pathways can be represented as the progression of a patient through a system and introduce a strategy to model the patientâ\u20AC™s flow as a sequence of accesses defined over a graph. Elements in the sequence correspond to features associated with the access transaction (e.g., reason for access). Based on this motivation, we model patterns of patient record usage, which may indicate deviations from care workflows. We evaluate our approach using several months of data from a large academic medical center. Empirical results show that this framework finds a small portion of accesses constitute outliers from such flows. We also observe that the violation patterns deviate for different types of medical services. Analysis of our results suggests greater deviation from normal access patterns by nonclinical users. We simulate anomalies in the context of real accesses to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method for different medical services. As an illustration of the capabilities of our method, it was observed that the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the Pediatrics service was found to be 0.9166. The results suggest that our approach is competitive with, and often better than, the existing state-of-the-art in its outlier detection performance. At the same time, our method is more efficient, by orders of magnitude, than previous approaches, allowing for detection of thousands of accesses in seconds."}
