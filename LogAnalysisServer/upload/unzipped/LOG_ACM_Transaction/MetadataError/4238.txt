The current trend toward open, extensible, and distributed multiuser hypermedia systems adds additional complexity to the development process. As a means of reducing this complexity, there has been an increasing interest in hyperbase management systems that allow hypermedia system developers to abstract from the intricacies and complexity of the hyperbase layer and fully attend to application and user interface issues. Design, development, and deployment experiences of a dynamic, open, and distributed multiuser hypermedia system development environment called Hyperform is presented. Hyperform is based on the concepts of extensibility, tailorability, and rapid prototyping of hypermedia system services. Open, extensible hyperbase management systems permit hypermedia system developers to tailor hypermedia functionality for specific applications and to serve as a platform for research. The Hyperform development environment is comprised of multiple instances of four component types: (1) a hyperbase management system server, (2) a tool integrator, (3) editors, and (4) participating tools. Hyperform has been deployed in Unix environments, and experiments have shown that Hyperform greatly reduces the effort required to provide customized hyperbase management system support for distributed multiuser hypermedia systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23770","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23770","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3308","fieldValue":" Categorization of scenes is a fundamental process of human vision that allows us to efficiently and rapidly analyze our surroundings. Several studies have explored the processes underlying human scene categorization, but they have focused on processing global image information. In this study, we present both psychophysical and computational experiments that investigate the role of local versus global image information in scene categorization. In a first set of human experiments, categorization performance is tested when only local or only global image information is present. Our results suggest that humans rely on local, region-based information as much as on global, configural information. In addition, humans seem to integrate both types of information for intact scene categorization. In a set of computational experiments, human performance is compared to two state-of-the-art computer vision approaches that have been shown to be psychophysically plausible and that model either local or global information. In addition to the influence of local versus global information, in a second series of experiments, we investigated the effect of color on the categorization performance of both the human observers and the computational model. Analysis of the human data suggests that color is an additional channel of perceptual information that leads to higher categorization results at the expense of increased reaction times in the intact condition. However, it does not affect reaction times when only local information is present. When color is removed, the employed computational model follows the relative performance decrease of human observers for each scene category and can thus be seen as a perceptually plausible model for human scene categorization based on local image information."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3308","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3308","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23771","fieldValue":" We present a probabilistic relational algebra (PRA) which is a generalization of standard relational algebra. In PRA, tuples are assigned probabilistic weights giving the probability that a tuple belongs to a relation. Based on intensional semantics, the tuple weights of the result of a PRA expression always conform to the underlying probabilistic model. We also show for which expressions extensional semantics yields the same results. Furthermore, we discuss complexity issues and indicate possibilities for optimization. With regard to databases, the approach allows for representing imprecise attribute values, whereas for information retrieval, probabilistic document indexing and probabilistic search term weighting can be modeled. We introduce the concept of vague predicates which yield probabilistic weights instead of Boolean values, thus allowing for queries with vague selection conditions. With these features, PRA implements uncertainty and vagueness in combination with the relational model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23771","fieldValue":"ACM"}
