NA faces two algorithmic challenges: 1) Which cost function to use to capture \"similarities\" between nodes in different networks? 2) Which alignment strategy to use to rapidly identify \"high-scoring\" alignments from all possible alignments? We \"break down\" existing state-of-the-art methods that use both different cost functions and different alignment strategies to evaluate each combination of their cost functions and alignment strategies. We find that a combination of the cost function of one method and the alignment strategy of another method beats the existing methods. Hence, we propose this combination as a novel superior NA method. Then, since human aging is hard to study experimentally due to long lifespan, we use NA to transfer aging-related knowledge from well annotated model species to poorly annotated human. By doing so, we produce novel human aging-related knowledge, which complements currently available knowledge about aging that has been obtained mainly by sequence alignment. We demonstrate significant similarity between topological and functional properties of our novel predictions and those of known aging-related genes. We are the first to use NA to learn more about aging."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5182","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5182","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5182","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5183","fieldValue":" Extra-cellular molecules trigger a response inside the cell by initiating a signal at special membrane receptors (i.e., sources), which is then transmitted to reporters (i.e., targets) through various chains of interactions among proteins. Understanding whether such a signal can reach from membrane receptors to reporters is essential in studying the cell response to extracellular events. This problem is drastically complicated due to the unreliability of the interaction data. In this paper, we develop a novel method, called PReach (Probabilistic Reachability), that precisely computes the probability that a signal can reach from a given collection of receptors to a given collection of reporters when the underlying signaling network is uncertain. This is a very difficult computational problem with no known polynomial-time solution. PReach represents each uncertain interaction as a bi-variate polynomial. It transforms the reachability problem to a polynomial multiplication problem. We introduce novel polynomial collapsing operators that associate polynomial terms with possible paths between sources and targets as well as the cuts that separate sources from targets. These operators significantly shrink the number of polynomial terms and thus the running time. PReach has much better time complexity than the recent solutions for this problem. Our experimental results on real data sets demonstrate that this improvement leads to orders of magnitude of reduction in the running time over the most recent methods.
