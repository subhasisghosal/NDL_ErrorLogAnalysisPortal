We consider a network comprising a server with an interface to the wired network, and other nodes requiring access to the information stored at the server. In order to reduce access latency in such a communication environment, an effective strategy is caching the server information at some of the nodes distributed across the network. Caching, however, can imply a considerable overhead cost; for instance, disseminating information incurs additional energy as well as bandwidth burden. Since wireless systems are plagued by scarcity of available energy and bandwidth, we need to design caching strategies that optimally trade-off between overhead cost and access latency. We pose our problem as an integer linear program. We show that this problem is the same as a special case of the connected facility location problem, which is known to be NP-hard. We devise a polynomial time algorithm which provides a suboptimal solution. The proposed algorithm applies to any arbitrary network topology and can be implemented in a distributed and asynchronous manner. In the case of a tree topology, our algorithm gives the optimal solution. In the case of an arbitrary topology, it finds a feasible solution with an objective function value within a factor of 6 of the optimal value. This performance is very close to the best approximate solution known today, which is obtained in a centralized manner. We compare the performance of our algorithm against three candidate cache placement schemes, and show via extensive simulation that our algorithm consistently outperforms these alternative schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9562","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9563","fieldValue":" Although independent consideration of layers simplifies wireless system design, it is inadequate since: 1) it does not consider the effect of co-channel user interference on higher layers; 2) it does not address the impact of local adaptation actions on overall performance; and 3) it attempts to optimize performance at one layer while keeping parameters of other layers fixed. Cross-layer adaptation techniques spanning several layers improve performance and provide better quality of service for users across layers. In this study, we consider a synergy between the physical and access layers and address the joint problem of channel allocation, modulation level, and power control in a multicell network. Since performance is determined by channel reuse, it is important to handle co-channel interference appropriately by constructing co-channel user sets and by assigning transmission parameters so that achievable system rate is maximized. The problem is considered for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, which introduces novel challenges to resource allocation due to different quality of subcarriers for users and existing transmit power constraints. We study the structure of the problem and present two classes of centralized heuristic algorithms. The first one considers each subcarrier separately and sequentially allocates users from different base stations in the subcarrier based on different criteria, while the second is based on water-filling across subcarriers in each cell. Our results show that the first class of heuristics performs better and quantify the impact of different parameters on system performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9563","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9563","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9563","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9564","fieldValue":" We consider a wireless basestation transmitting high-speed data to multiple mobile users in a cell. The channel conditions between the basestation and the users are time-varying and user-dependent. Our objective is to design a scheduler that determines which user to schedule at each time step. Previous work on this problem has typically assumed that the channel conditions are governed by a stationary stochastic process. In this setting, a popular algorithm known as Max-Weight has been shown to have good performance.However, the stationarity assumption is not always reasonable. In this paper, we study a more general worst-case model in which the channel conditions are governed by an adversary and are not necessarily stationary. In this model, we show that the nonstationarities can cause Max-Weight to have extremely poor performance. In particular, even if the set of possible transmission rates is finite, as in the CDMA 1xEV-DO system, Max-Weight can produce queue sizes that are exponential in the number of users. On the positive side, we describe a set of tracking algorithms that aim to track the performance of a schedule maintained by the adversary. For one of these tracking algorithms, the queue sizes are only quadratic.We discuss a number of practical issues associated with the tracking algorithms. We also illustrate the performance of Max-Weight and the tracking algorithms using simulation."}
