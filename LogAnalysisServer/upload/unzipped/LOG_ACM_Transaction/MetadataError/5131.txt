Prevalent solution techniques are centralized and model basedâ\u20AC\u201Dlimitations that we address by distributed reinforcement learning (RL). We particularly favor alternate learning, where agents alternately learn best responses to each other, which appears to outperform concurrent RL. However, alternate learning requires an initial policy. We propose two principled approaches to generating informed initial policies: a naive approach that lays the foundation for a more sophisticated approach. We empirically demonstrate that the refined approach produces near-optimal solutions in many challenging benchmark settings, staking a claim to being an efficient (and realistic) approximate solver in its own right. Furthermore, alternate best response learning seeded with such policies quickly learns high-quality policies as well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3986","fieldValue":" Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is significantly more challenging in the case of multichannel reproduction compared to the single-channel case. This is mainly due to the so-called nonuniqueness problem, which becomes especially severe for massive multichannel reproduction systems like, e.g., wave field synthesis systems or higher-order ambisonics, where the different loudspeaker signals are often strongly correlated. In this paper, a multichannel wave-domain AEC structure is proposed that maintains robustness without altering the loudspeaker signals, as is commonly required to preserve the reproduction quality. The proposed method exploits the dominance of certain couplings in the wave-domain representation of the loudspeaker-enclosure-microphone system. In this representation, preferring a strong weight of the dominant couplings in the identified system improves the system identification performance. A modification of the well-known generalized frequency-domain adaptive filtering algorithm is then presented to implement the proposed approach, including a self-contained description of all necessary components. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed method to competing approaches and shows that the proposed method compares well in terms of convergence behavior while avoiding the performance degradation, which is intrinsic to other approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3986","fieldValue":"Multichannel acoustic echo cancellation in the wave domain with increased robustness to nonuniqueness"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3986","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3986","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3987","fieldValue":"OHanlon, Ken"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3987","fieldValue":" Automatic music transcription (AMT) can be performed by deriving a pitch-time representation through decomposition of a spectrogram with a dictionary of pitch-labelled atoms. Typically, non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) methods are used to decompose magnitude spectrograms. One atom is often used to represent each note. However, the spectrum of a note may change over time. Previous research considered this variability using different atoms to model specific parts of a note, or large dictionaries comprised of datapoints from the spectrograms of full notes. In this paper, the use of subspace modelling of note spectra is explored, with group sparsity employed as a means of coupling activations of related atoms into a pitched subspace. Stepwise and gradient-based methods for non-negative group sparse decompositions are proposed. Finally, a group sparse NMF approach is used to tune a generic harmonic subspace dictionary, leading to improved NMF-based AMT results."}
