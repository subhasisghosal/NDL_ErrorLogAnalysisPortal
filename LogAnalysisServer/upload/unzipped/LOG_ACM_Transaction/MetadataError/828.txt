In contrast to existing storage architectures, we consider a PCM-based storage architecture to enhance the reliability of storage systems. In PCM-based storage systems, the major challenge falls on how to prevent the frequently updated (meta)data from wearing out their residing PCM cells without excessively searching and moving metadata around the PCM space and without extensively updating the index structures of file systems. In this work, we propose an adaptive wear-leveling mechanism to prevent any PCM cell from being worn out prematurely by selecting appropriate data for swapping with constant search\/sort cost. Meanwhile, the concept of indirect pointers is designed in the proposed mechanism to swap data without any modification to the file system's indexes. Experiments were conducted based on well-known benchmarks and realistic workloads to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design, for which the results are encouraging."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13422","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13422","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13423","fieldValue":" Pipelined computing is a promising paradigm for embedded system design. Designing a power management policy to reduce the power consumption of a pipelined system with nondeterministic workload is, however, nontrivial. In this article, we study the problem of energy minimization for coarse-grained pipelined systems under hard real-time constraints and propose new approaches based on an inverse use of the pay-burst-only-once principle. We formulate the problem by means of the resource demands of individual pipeline stages and propose two new approaches, a quadratic programming-based approach and fast heuristic, to solve the problem. In the quadratic programming approach, the problem is transformed into a standard quadratic programming with box constraint and then solved by a standard quadratic programming solver. Observing the problem is NP-hard, the fast heuristic is designed to solve the problem more efficiently. Our approach is scalable with respect to the numbers of pipeline stages. Simulation results using real-life applications are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods."}
