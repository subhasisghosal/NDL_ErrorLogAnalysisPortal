We study topological queries expressible in the standard query language on spatial databases, first-order logic with various amounts of arithmetic. Our main technical result is a combinatorial characterization of the expressive power of topological first-order logic on regular spatial databases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11376","fieldValue":" A category of HO\/N-style games and probabilistic strategies is developed where the possible choices of a strategy are quantified so as to give a measure of the likelihood of seeing a given play. A two-sided die is shown to be universal in this category, in the sense that any strategy breaks down into a composition between some deterministic strategy and that die. The interpretative power of the category is then demonstrated by delineating a Cartesian closed subcategory that provides a fully abstract model of a probabilistic extension of Idealized Algol."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11377","fieldValue":" A syntactical proof is given that all functions definable in a certain affine linear typed Î»-calculus with iteration in all types are polynomial time computable.
