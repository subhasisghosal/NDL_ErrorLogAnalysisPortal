However, computing quality PolyCube base-complexes for general shapes, providing a good trade-off between mapping distortion and singularity counts, remains a challenge. Our work improves on the state-of-the-art in PolyCube computation by adopting a graph-cut inspired approach. We observe that, given an arbitrary input mesh, the computation of a suitable PolyCube base-complex can be formulated as associating, or labeling, each input mesh triangle with one of six signed principal axis directions. Most of the criteria for a desirable PolyCube labeling can be satisfied using a multi-label graph-cut optimization with suitable local unary and pairwise terms. However, the highly constrained nature of PolyCubes, imposed by the need to align each chart with one of the principal axes, enforces additional global constraints that the labeling must satisfy. To enforce these constraints, we develop a constrained discrete optimization technique, PolyCut, which embeds a graph-cut multi-label optimization within a hill-climbing local search framework that looks for solutions that minimize the cut energy while satisfying the global constraints. We further optimize our generated PolyCube base-complexes through a combination of distortion-minimizing deformation, followed by a labeling update and a final PolyCube parameterization step. Our PolyCut formulation captures the desired properties of a PolyCube base-complex, balancing parameterization distortion against singularity count, and produces demonstrably better PolyCube base-complexes then previous work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16952","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16953","fieldValue":" We propose a highly memory-efficient representation for modeling and rendering urban buildings composed predominantly of rectangular block structures, which can be used to completely or partially represent most modern buildings. With the proposed representation, the data size required for modeling most buildings is more than two orders of magnitude less than using the conventional mesh representation. In addition, it substantially reduces the dependency on conventional texture maps, which are not space-efficient for defining visual details of building facades. The proposed representation can be stored and transmitted as images and can be rendered directly without any mesh reconstruction. A ray-casting based shader has been developed to render buildings thus represented on the GPU with a high frame rate to support interactive fly-by as well as street-level walk-through. Comparisons with standard geometric representations and recent urban modeling techniques indicate the proposed representation performs well when viewed from a short and long distance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16953","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16953","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16954","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a novel content-adaptive image downscaling method. The key idea is to optimize the shape and locations of the downsampling kernels to better align with local image features. Our content-adaptive kernels are formed as a bilateral combination of two Gaussian kernels defined over space and color, respectively. This yields a continuum ranging from smoothing to edge\/detail preserving kernels driven by image content. We optimize these kernels to represent the input image well, by finding an output image from which the input can be well reconstructed. This is technically realized as an iterative maximum-likelihood optimization using a constrained variation of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In comparison to previous downscaling algorithms, our results remain crisper without suffering from ringing artifacts. Besides natural images, our algorithm is also effective for creating pixel art images from vector graphics inputs, due to its ability to keep linear features sharp and connected."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16954","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16954","fieldValue":"ACM"}
