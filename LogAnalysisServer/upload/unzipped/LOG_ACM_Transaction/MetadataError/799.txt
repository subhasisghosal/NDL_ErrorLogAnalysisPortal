{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13361","fieldValue":" Spin-Torque Transfer RAM (STT-RAM) is a promising candidate for SRAM replacement because of its excellent features, such as fast read access, high density, low leakage power, and CMOS technology compatibility. However, wide adoption of STT-RAM as cache memories is impeded by its long write latency and high write power. Recent work proposed improving the write performance through relaxing the retention time of STT-RAM cells. The resultant volatile STT-RAM needs to be periodically refreshed to prevent data loss. When volatile STT-RAM is applied as the last-level cache (LLC) in chip multiprocessor (CMP) systems, frequent refresh operations could dissipate significant extra energy. In addition, refresh operations could severely conflict with normal read\/write operations to degrade overall system performance. Therefore, minimizing the performance impact caused by refresh operations is crucial for the adoption of volatile STT-RAM. In this article, we propose Cache-Coherence-Enabled Adaptive Refresh (CCear) to minimize the number of refresh operations for volatile STT-RAM, adopted as the LLC for CMP systems. Specifically, CCear interacts with cache coherence protocol and cache management policy to minimize the number of refresh operations on volatile STT-RAM caches. Full-system simulation results show that CCear performs close to an ideal refresh policy with low overhead. Compared with state-of-the-art refresh policies, CCear simultaneously improves the system performance and reduces the energy consumption. Moreover, the performance of CCear could be further enhanced using small filter caches to accommodate the not-refreshed private STT-RAM blocks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2274","fieldValue":" We study routing and scheduling in multihop wireless networks. When data is transmitted from its source node to its destination node it may go through other wireless nodes as intermediate hops. The data transmission is node constrained, that is, every node can transmit data to at most one neighboring node per time step. The transmission rates are time varying as a result of changing wireless channel conditions. In this article, we assume that data arrivals and transmission rates are governed by an adversary. The power of the adversary is limited by an admissibility condition which forbids the adversary from overloading any wireless node a priori. The node-constrained transmission and time-varying nature of the transmission rates make our model different from and harder than the standard adversarial queueing model which relates to wireline networks. For the case in which the adversary specifies the paths that the data must follow, we design scheduling algorithms that ensure network stability. These algorithms try to give priority to the data that is closest to its source node. However, at each time step only a subset of the data queued at a node is eligible for scheduling. One of our algorithms is fully distributed. For the case in which the adversary does not dictate the data paths, we show how to route data so that the admissibility condition is satisfied. We can then schedule data along the chosen paths using our stable scheduling algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13362","fieldValue":"Liu, Xue-Xin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13362","fieldValue":"Tan, Sheldon X-D"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13362","fieldValue":"Palma-Rodriguez, Adolfo Adair"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13362","fieldValue":"Tlelo-Cuautle, Esteban"}
