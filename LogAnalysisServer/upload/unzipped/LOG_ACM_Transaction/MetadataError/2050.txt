Our key contribution lies in treating the problem in the gradient domain. We use a standard technique to estimate scene depth, but assign depths to image gradients rather than pixels. A novel view is obtained by rendering the horizontal and vertical gradients, from which the final result is reconstructed through Poisson integration using an approximate solution as a data term. Our algorithm is able to handle general scenes including reflections and similar effects without explicitly separating the scene into reflective and transmissive parts, as required by previous work. Our prototype renderer is fully implemented on the GPU and runs in real time on commodity hardware."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16981","fieldValue":" We introduce \"time hallucination\": synthesizing a plausible image at a different time of day from an input image. This challenging task often requires dramatically altering the color appearance of the picture. In this paper, we introduce the first data-driven approach to automatically creating a plausible-looking photo that appears as though it were taken at a different time of day. The time of day is specified by a semantic time label, such as \"night\". Our approach relies on a database of time-lapse videos of various scenes. These videos provide rich information about the variations in color appearance of a scene throughout the day. Our method transfers the color appearance from videos with a similar scene as the input photo. We propose a locally affine model learned from the video for the transfer, allowing our model to synthesize new color data while retaining image details. We show that this model can hallucinate a wide range of different times of day. The model generates a large sparse linear system, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. We validate our methods by synthesizing transforming photos of various outdoor scenes to four times of interest: daytime, the golden hour, the blue hour, and nighttime."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16982","fieldValue":" High dynamic range reconstruction of dynamic scenes requires careful handling of dynamic objects to prevent ghosting. However, in a recent review, Srikantha et al. [2012] conclude that \"there is no single best method and the selection of an approach depends on the user's goal\". We attempt to solve this problem with a novel approach that models the noise distribution of color values. We estimate the likelihood that a pair of colors in different images are observations of the same irradiance, and we use a Markov random field prior to reconstruct irradiance from pixels that are likely to correspond to the same static scene object. Dynamic content is handled by selecting a single low dynamic range source image and hand-held capture is supported through homography-based image alignment. Our noise-based reconstruction method achieves better ghost detection and removal than state-of-the-art methods for cluttered scenes with large object displacements. As such, our method is broadly applicable and helps move the field towards a single method for dynamic scene HDR reconstruction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16982","fieldValue":"ACM"}
