Instantaneous signal strength may be noisy, but the smoothed signal typically exhibits a period that matches the person's stride period. We present an opportunistic packet scheduler that extracts a set of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) samples from application traffic and utilizes an accelerometer to monitor the person's gait cycle. Packets are scheduled based on previous RSSI peaks and the current offset within the gait cycle. We formulate the task of finding a nonoverlapping packet schedule among the different body area network (BAN) devices as a linear programming problem and present an efficient way of solving it with the simplex method. Our experimental evaluation shows that outdoors BAN links with PRR (ratio of correctly received to transmitted packets) values between 50&percnt; and 90&percnt; can typically be turned into reliable links with PRR values well above 90&percnt;. Indoors the improvements are smaller, but still significant at low transmission power. The main price is an increase in packet delivery latency. The energy consumed by the devices is marginal, but the coordinator spends more energy due to signal processing."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21489","fieldValue":"MAC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3047","fieldValue":" This article presents an approach to nonnative pronunciation variants modeling and prediction. The pronunciation variants prediction method was developed by generalized transformation-based error-driven learning (GTBL). The modified goodness of pronunciation (GOP) score was applied to effective mispronunciation detection using logistic regression machine learning under the pronunciation variants prediction. English-read speech data uttered by Korean-speaking learners of English were collected, then pronunciation variation knowledge was extracted from the differences between the canonical phonemes and the actual phonemes of the speech data. With this knowledge, an error-driven learning approach was designed that automatically learns phoneme variation rules from phoneme-level transcriptions. The learned rules generate an extended recognition network to detect mispronunciations. Three different mispronunciation detection methods were tested including our logistic regression machine learning method with modified GOP scores and mispronunciation preference features; all three methods yielded significant improvement in predictions of pronunciation variants, and our logistic regression method showed the best performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21490","fieldValue":" Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) promise researchers a powerful instrument for observing sizable phenomena with fine granularity over long periods. Since the accuracy of data is important to the whole system's performance, detecting nodes with faulty readings is an essential issue in network management. As a complementary solution to detecting nodes with functional faults, this article, proposes FIND, a novel method to detect nodes with data faults that neither assumes a particular sensing model nor requires costly event injections. After the nodes in a network detect a natural event, FIND ranks the nodes based on their sensing readings as well as their physical distances from the event. FIND works for systems where the measured signal attenuates with distance. A node is considered faulty if there is a significant mismatch between the sensor data rank and the distance rank. Theoretically, we show that average ranking difference is a provable indicator of possible data faults. FIND is extensively evaluated in simulations and two test bed experiments with up to 25 MicaZ nodes. Evaluation shows that FIND has a less than 5&percnt; miss detection rate and false alarm rate in most noisy environments."}
