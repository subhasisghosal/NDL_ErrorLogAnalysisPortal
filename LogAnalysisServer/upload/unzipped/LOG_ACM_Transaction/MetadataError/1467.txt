Normal meshes are particularly attractive since their level-to-level displacements are in the local normal direction only. Consequently, they only require scalar coefficients to specify. In this article, we propose a novel method to approximate a given mesh with a normal mesh. Instead of building an associated parameterization on the fly, we assume a globally smooth parameterization at the beginning and cast the problem as one of perturbing this parameterization. Controlling the magnitude of this perturbation gives us explicit control over the range between fully constrained (only scalar coefficients) and unconstrained (3-vector coefficients) approximations. With the unconstrained problem giving the lowest approximation error, we can thus characterize the error cost of normal meshes as a function of the number of nonnormal offsets---we find a significant gain for little (error) cost. Because the normal mesh construction creates a geometry driven approximation, we can replace the difficult geometric distance minimization problem with a much simpler least squares problem. This variational approach reduces magnitude and structure (aliasing) of the error further. Our method separates the parameterization construction into an initial setup followed only by subsequent perturbations, giving us an algorithm which is far simpler to implement, more robust, and significantly faster."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15485","fieldValue":"(semi-)regular meshes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15485","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15485","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2467","fieldValue":" For a given number L, an L-length-bounded edge-cut (node-cut, respectively) in a graph G with source s and sink t is a set C of edges (nodes, respectively) such that no s-t-path of length at most L remains in the graph after removing the edges (nodes, respectively) in C. An L-length-bounded flow is a flow that can be decomposed into flow paths of length at most L. In contrast to classical flow theory, we describe instances for which the minimum L-length-bounded edge-cut (node-cut, respectively) is $Î˜(n^2\/3)-times (Î˜(&sqrt;n)-times, respectively) larger than the maximum L-length-bounded flow, where n denotes the number of nodes; this is the worst case. We show that the minimum length-bounded cut problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of 1.1377 for Lâ\u2030¥ 5 in the case of node-cuts and for Lâ\u2030¥ 4 in the case of edge-cuts. We also describe algorithms with approximation ratio O(min&lbrace;L,n\/L&rbrace;) âŠ\u2020 O&sqrt;n in the node case and O(min &lbrace;L,n2\/L2,&sqrt;m&rbrace; âŠ\u2020 O2\/3$ in the edge case, where m denotes the number of edges. Concerning L-length-bounded flows, we show that in graphs with unit-capacities and general edge lengths it is NP-complete to decide whether there is a fractional length-bounded flow of a given value. We analyze the structure of optimal solutions and present further complexity results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15486","fieldValue":"OSullivan, Carol"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15486","fieldValue":" Hierarchical object representations play an important role in performing efficient collision handling. Many different geometric primitives have been used to construct these representations, which allow areas of interaction to be localized quickly. For time-critical algorithms, there are distinct advantages to using hierarchies of spheres, known as sphere-trees, for object representation. This article presents a novel algorithm for the construction of sphere-trees. The algorithm presented approximates objects, both convex and non-convex, with a higher degree of fit than existing algorithms. In the lower levels of the representations, there is almost an order of magnitude decrease in the number of spheres required to represent the objects to a given accuracy."}
