We designed a look-alike radiology task with artificial stimuli. The task involved a comparative visual search of two side-by-side images, using two different interaction techniques. We tracked the eyegaze of four radiologists while they performed the task and measured the duration of the fixations on the controls, the left and right images, and on the artificial targets. Response time differences between the two interaction techniques exceeded the differences of fixations on the controls. Fixations on the left-side images are longer than the right-side images, and the search for multifeatured targets occurs in two phases: first a regular scan path search phase for a likely target and then a confirmation phase of several fixations on the target in each side-by-side image. We conclude that eyegaze tracking shows that disruption of visual search leads to cognitive disruption; subjects use the left image as a reference image and multiple saccades between left and right side images are necessary, because of the limitations of the visual working memory."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3274","fieldValue":"An application of eyegaze tracking for designing radiologists' workstations: Insights for comparative visual search tasks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23307","fieldValue":"Fletcher, Kenneth K"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23307","fieldValue":"Liu, Xiaoqing F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23307","fieldValue":" For service users to get the best service that meet their requirements, they prefer to personalize their nonfunctional attributes, such as reliability and price. However, the personalization makes it challenging for service providers to completely meet usersâ\u20AC™ preferences, because they have to deal with conflicting nonfunctional attributes when selecting services for users. With this in mind, users may sometimes want to explicitly specify their trade-offs among nonfunctional attributes to make their preferences known to service providers. In this article, we present a novel service selection method based on fuzzy logic that considers usersâ\u20AC™ personalized preferences and their trade-offs on nonfunctional attributes during service selection. The method allows users to represent their elastic nonfunctional requirements and associated importance using linguistic terms to specify their personalized trade-off strategies. We present examples showing how the service selection framework is used and a prototype with real-world airline services to evaluate the proposed framework's application."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23307","fieldValue":"ACM"}
