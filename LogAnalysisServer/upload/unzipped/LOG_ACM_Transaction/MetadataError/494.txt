An early result by Morgenstern from 1973, provides an Î©(nlog n) lower bound for the unnormalized Fourier transform when the constants used in the computation are bounded. The proof uses a potential function related to a determinant. That result does not explain why the normalized Fourier transform (of unit determinant) should be difficult to compute in the same model. Hence, it is not scale insensitive. More recently, Ailon [2013] showed that if only unitary 2-by-2 gates are used, and additionally no extra memory is allowed, then the normalized Fourier transform requires Î©(nlog n) steps. This rather limited result is also sensitive to scaling, but highlights the complexity inherent in the Fourier transform arising from introducing entropy, unlike, say, the identity matrix (which is as complex as the Fourier transform using Morgensternâ\u20AC™s arguments, under proper scaling). This work improves on Ailon [2013] in two ways: First, we eliminate the scaling restriction and provide a lower bound for computing any scaling of the Fourier transform. Second, we allow the computational model to use extra memory. Our restriction is that the composition of all gates up to any point must be a well- conditioned linear transformation. The lower bound is $Î©(R^âˆ\u20191$nlog n), where R is the uniform condition number. Well-conditioned is a natural requirement for algorithms accurately computing linear transformations on machine architectures of bounded word size. Hence, this result can be seen as a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. The main technical contribution is an extension of matrix entropy used in Ailon [2013] for unitary matrices to a potential function computable for any invertible matrix, using â\u20ACœquasi-entropyâ\u20AC? of â\u20ACœquasi-probabilities.â\u20AC?"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12546","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12546","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12547","fieldValue":" We study the query complexity of testing for properties defined by read-once formulas, as instances of massively parametrized properties, and prove several testability and nontestability results. First, we prove the testability of any property accepted by a Boolean read-once formula involving any bounded arity gates, with a number of queries exponential in &epsi;, doubly exponential in the arity, and independent of all other parameters. When the gates are limited to being monotone, we prove that there is an estimation algorithm that outputs an approximation of the distance of the input from satisfying the property. For formulas only involving And\/Or gates, we provide a more efficient test whose query complexity is only quasipolynomial in &epsi;. On the other hand, we show that such testability results do not hold in general for formulas over non-Boolean alphabets. Specifically, we construct a property defined by a read-once arity 2 (non-Boolean) formula over an alphabet of size 4, such that any 1\/4-test for it requires a number of queries depending on the formula size. We also present such a formula over an alphabet of size 5 that also satisfies a strong monotonicity condition."}
