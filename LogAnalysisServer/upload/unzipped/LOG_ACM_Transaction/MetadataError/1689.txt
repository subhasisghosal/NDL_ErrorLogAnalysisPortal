The quality of service is considered in the framework of adversarial queuing. An adversary is determined by injection rate and burstiness, the latter denoting the number of packets that can be injected simultaneously in a round. We consider only injection rates that are less than 1. A protocol is stable when the numbers of packets in queues stay bounded at all rounds, and it is of fair latency when waiting times of packets in queues are O(burstiness\/rate). For channels with collision detection, we give a full-sensing protocol of fair latency for injection rates that are at most 1 2(âŒˆlg nâŒ\u2030 + 1), where n is the number of stations, and show that fair latency is impossible to achieve for injection rates that are Ï\u2030(1 log n). For channels without collision detection, we present a full-sensing protocol of fair latency for injection rates that are at most 1 c $lg^2 n, for some c > 0. We show that there exists an acknowledgment-based protocol that has fair latency for injection rates that are at most 1 cn lg2 n, for some c > 0, and develop an explicit acknowledgment-based protocol of fair latency for injection rates that are at most 1 27n2$ ln n. Regarding impossibility to achieve just stability by restricted protocols, we prove that no acknowledgment-based protocol can be stable for injection rates larger than 3 1 + lg n."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16055","fieldValue":"Gomes, Abel J P"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16055","fieldValue":"Morgado, Jos F M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16055","fieldValue":" Mathematical systems (e.g., Mathematica, Maple, Matlab, and DPGraph) easily plot planar algebraic curves implicitly defined by polynomial functions. However, these systems, and most algorithms found in the literature, cannot draw many implicit curves correctly; in particular, those with singularities (self-intersections, cusps, and isolated points). They do not detect sign-invariant components either, because they use numerical methods based on the Bolzano corollary, that is, they assume that the curve-describing function f flips sign somewhere in a line segment &ABhorbar; that crosses the curve, or f(A)Â·f(B) < 0. To solve these problems, we have generalized the False Position (FP) method to determine two types of zeros: (i) crossing zeros and (ii) extremal zeros (local minima and maxima without function sign variation). We have called this method the Generalized False Position (GFP) method. It allows us to sample an implicit curve against the Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), say bisection lines, of a rectangular region of $R^2$. Interestingly, the GFP method can also be used to determine isolated points of the curve. The result is a general algorithm for sampling and rendering planar implicit curves with topological guarantees."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16055","fieldValue":"A BSP-based algorithm for dimensionally nonhomogeneous planar implicit curves with topological guarantees"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16055","fieldValue":"ACM"}
