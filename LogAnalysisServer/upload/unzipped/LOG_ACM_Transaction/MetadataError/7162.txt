Such models a appear frequently in the teletraffic analysis of computer and communications networks. Our arrival models are assumed to be quite general. They could be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) in successive slots, periodic, Markovian, or described by the moving average time-series model, etc. Our solution framework is novel and unifying and it uses a combination of multidimensional generating functions and combinatorial analysis utilizing extensions of classical ballot theorems. In general, we provide an explicit analytical expression as an infinite sum to obtain the system stationary probability distribution avoiding classical root-finding methods, matrix analytical methodologies, and spectral decomposition approaches. We provide a number of analytical and numerical examples including the i.i.d. models with Poisson and Binomial arrivals, the multiserver queueing systems fed by Markovian sources, queues fed with a discrete moving average source of the first and second order, and an i.i.d. discrete Pareto batch arrival model. Closed-form analytical expressions are obtained for the stationary distribution of the system queue lengths and numerical examples are also provided when appropriate."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9144","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9145","fieldValue":" Channel access has been an active research area for the past two decades. Several protocols have been proposed in literature to efficiently utilize the channel bandwidth. Some of the recently proposed protocols achieve a near-ideal channel utilization. However, the efficiency in utilization comes at the expense of certain unfairness in delay characteristics. In this paper, a new channel-access protocol, called access mechanism for efficient sharing in broadcast medium networks (AMES-BM), is developed based on a deterministic binary tree-splitting technique to achieve efficient sharing of bandwidth. In AMES-BM, the stations are dynamically mapped to leaf nodes of a binary tree. The stations are then divided into smaller groups that mimic the behavior of an ideal transmission queue. Collisions are allowed to occur within these groups and are resolved using a variation of the conventional binary tree-splitting technique.The performance of AMES-BM is similar to that of a collisionbased protocol under low loads and to that of a collision-free protocol under high loads. Besides achieving a near-optimal channel utilization, the proposed protocol also guarantees fairness with respect to delay for messages of varying lengths. The deterministic nature of the protocol makes it more attractive for real-time applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9145","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
