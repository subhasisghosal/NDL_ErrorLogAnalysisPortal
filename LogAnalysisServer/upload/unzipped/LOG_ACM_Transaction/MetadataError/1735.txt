Using a reprojection strategy, we maintain several sets of shading estimates at subpixel precision, and incrementally update these such that for most pixels only one new shaded sample is evaluated per frame. The key difficulty is to prevent accumulated blurring during successive reprojections. We present a theoretical analysis of the blur introduced by reprojection methods. Based on this analysis, we introduce a nonuniform spatial filter, an adaptive recursive temporal filter, and a principled scheme for locally estimating the spatial blur. Our scheme is appropriate for antialiasing shading attributes that vary slowly over time. It works in a single rendering pass on commodity graphics hardware, and offers results that surpass 4x4 stratified supersampling in quality, at a fraction of the cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16173","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16174","fieldValue":" We present an approach for extracting reliefs and details from relief surfaces. We consider a relief surface as a surface composed of two components: a base surface and a height function which is defined over this base. However, since the base surface is unknown, the decoupling of these components is a challenge. We show how to estimate a robust height function over the base, without explicitly extracting the base surface. This height function is utilized to separate the relief from the base. Several applications benefiting from this extraction are demonstrated, including relief segmentation, detail exaggeration and dampening, copying of details from one object to another, and curve drawing on meshes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16174","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16174","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16175","fieldValue":" Man-made objects are ubiquitous in the real world and in virtual environments. While such objects can be very detailed, capturing every small feature, they are often identified and characterized by a small set of defining curves. Compact, abstracted shape descriptions based on such curves are often visually more appealing than the original models, which can appear to be visually cluttered. We introduce a novel algorithm for abstracting three-dimensional geometric models using characteristic curves or contours as building blocks for the abstraction. Our method robustly handles models with poor connectivity, including the extreme cases of polygon soups, common in models of man-made objects taken from online repositories. In our algorithm, we use a two-step procedure that first approximates the input model using a manifold, closed envelope surface and then extracts from it a hierarchical abstraction curve network along with suitable normal information. The constructed curve networks form a compact, yet powerful, representation for the input shapes, retaining their key shape characteristics while discarding minor details and irregularities."}
