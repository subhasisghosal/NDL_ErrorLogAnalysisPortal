It finds that even before joining the incentive program, adopter hospitals had more efficient and effective Medicare operations than those of non-adopters. Adopters were also financially more efficient. After joining the program, adopter hospitals treated significantly more Medicare patients by shortening their stay durations, relative to their own non-Medicare patients and also to patients at non-adopter hospitals, even as their overall capacity utilization remained relatively unchanged. The study concludes that many of these hospitals had implemented EHR even before the initiation of the incentive program. It further infers that they joined this program with opportunistic intentions of tapping into incentive payouts which they maximized by taking on more Medicare patients. These findings give credence to critics of the program who have questioned its utility and alleged that it serves only to reward existing users of EHR technologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8201","fieldValue":"Business Benefits or Incentive Maximization?

Early prediction of patients at risk for septic shock is therefore crucial to minimizing the effects of these complications. Potential indications for septic shock risk span a wide range of measurements, including physiological data gathered at different temporal resolutions and gene expression levels, leading to a nontrivial prediction problem. Previous works on septic shock prediction have used small, carefully curated datasets or clinical measurements that may not be available for many ICU patients. The recent availability of a large, rich ICU dataset called MIMIC-II has provided the opportunity for more extensive modeling of this problem. However, such a large clinical dataset inevitably contains a substantial amount of missing data. We investigate how different imputation selection criteria and methods can overcome the missing data problem. Our results show that imputation methods in conjunction with predictive modeling can lead to accurate septic shock prediction, even if the features are restricted primarily to noninvasive measurements. Our models provide a generalized approach for predicting septic shock in any ICU patient."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1740","fieldValue":" Chip Multiprocessors (CMP) with distributed L2 caches suffer from a cache fragmentation problem; some caches may be overutilized while others may be underutilized. To avoid such fragmentation, researchers have proposed capacity sharing mechanisms where applications that need additional cache space can place their victim blocks in remote caches. However, we found that only allowing victim blocks to be placed on remote caches tends to cause a high number of remote cache hits relative to local cache hits. In this article, we show that many of the remote cache hits can be converted into local cache hits if we allow newly fetched blocks to be selectively placed directly in a remote cache, rather than in the local cache. To demonstrate this, we use future trace information to estimate the near-upperbound performance that can be gained from combined placement and replacement decisions in capacity sharing. Motivated by encouraging experimental results, we design a simple, predictor-based, scheme called Adaptive Placement Policy (APP) that learns from past cache behavior to make a better decision on whether to place a newly fetched block in the local or remote cache. We found that across 50 multiprogrammed workload mixes running on a 4-core CMP, APP's capacity sharing mechanism increases aggregate performance by 29&percnt; on average. At the same time, APP outperforms the state-of-the-art capacity sharing mechanism that uses only replacement-based decisions by up to 18.2&percnt;, with a maximum degradation of only 0.5&percnt;, and an average improvement of 3&percnt;."}
