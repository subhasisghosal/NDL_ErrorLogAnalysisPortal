Unfortunately, in practice this usually means extracting data from a database system into an external tool (such as SAS, R, Arena, or Matlab), and then running the analysis there. This extract-and-model paradigm is typically error-prone, slow, does not support fine-grained modeling, and discourages what-if and sensitivity analyses. In this article we describe MCDB, a database system that permits a wide spectrum of stochastic models to be used in conjunction with the data stored in a large database, without ever extracting the data. MCDB facilitates in-database execution of tasks such as risk assessment, prediction, and imputation of missing data, as well as management of errors due to data integration, information extraction, and privacy-preserving data anonymization. MCDB allows a user to define â\u20ACœrandomâ\u20AC? relations whose contents are determined by stochastic models. The models can then be queried using standard SQL. Monte Carlo techniques are used to analyze the probability distribution of the result of an SQL query over random relations. Novel â\u20ACœtuple-bundleâ\u20AC? processing techniques can effectively control the Monte Carlo overhead, as shown in our experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14543","fieldValue":"MCDB"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14543","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14543","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14544","fieldValue":" Preferences have been traditionally studied in philosophy, psychology, and economics and applied to decision making problems. Recently, they have attracted the attention of researchers in other fields, such as databases where they capture soft criteria for queries. Databases bring a whole fresh perspective to the study of preferences, both computational and representational. From a representational perspective, the central question is how we can effectively represent preferences and incorporate them in database querying. From a computational perspective, we can look at how we can efficiently process preferences in the context of database queries. Several approaches have been proposed but a systematic study of these works is missing. The purpose of this survey is to provide a framework for placing existing works in perspective and highlight critical open challenges to serve as a springboard for researchers in database systems. We organize our study around three axes: preference representation, preference composition, and preference query processing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14544","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14544","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14545","fieldValue":"zsoyolu, Z.
