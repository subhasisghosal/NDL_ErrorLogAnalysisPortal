When a response has a known gradient, it is often easily improved along the path of steepest ascent. On the contrary, a stochastic approximation technique may be used when the gradient is unknown or costly to obtain. We consider the problem of optimizing multiple responses in which the gradient is known for only one response. We propose a hybrid approach for this problem, called simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation steepest ascent, SPSA-SA or $SP(SA)^2 for short. SP(SA)2 is an SPSA technique that leverages information about the known gradient to constrain the perturbations used to approximate the others. We apply SP(SA)2 to the cross-layer optimization of throughput, packet loss, and end-to-end delay in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), a self-organizing wireless network. The results show that SP(SA)2$ achieves higher throughput and lower packet loss and end-to-end delay than the steepest ascent, SPSA, and the Nelder--Mead stochastic approximation approaches. It also reduces the cost in the number of iterations to perform the optimization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25013","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25013","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3420","fieldValue":" In order to better understand how scene motion is perceived in immersive virtual environments, we measured scene-motion thresholds under different conditions across three experiments. Thresholds were measured during quasi-sinusoidal head yaw, single left-to-right or right-to-left head yaw, different phases of head yaw, slow to fast head yaw, scene motion relative to head yaw, and two scene-illumination levels. We found that across various conditions (1) thresholds are greater when the scene moves with head yaw (corresponding to gain 1.0), and (2) thresholds increase as head motion increases."}
