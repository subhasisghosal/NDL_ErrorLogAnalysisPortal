{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17268","fieldValue":" Color selection is required in many computer graphics applications, but can be tedious, as 1D or 2D user interfaces are employed to navigate in a 3D color space. Until now the problem was considered a question of designing general color spaces with meaningful (e.g., perceptual) parameters. In this work, we show how color selection usability improves by applying 1D or 2D color manifolds that predict the most likely change of color in a specific context. A typical use-case is manipulating the color of a banana; instead of presenting a 2D+1D RGB, CIE Lab, or HSV widget, our approach presents a simple 1D slider that captures the most likely change for this context. Technically, for each context, we learn a lower-dimensional manifold with varying density from labeled Internet examples. We demonstrate the increase in task performance of color selection in a user study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17268","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17268","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17269","fieldValue":" Given the current profusion of devices for viewing media, video content created at one aspect ratio is often viewed on displays with different aspect ratios. Many previous solutions address this problem by retargeting or resizing the video, but a more general solution would re-edit the video for the new display. Our method employs the three primary editing operations: pan, cut, and zoom. We let viewers implicitly reveal what is important in a video by tracking their gaze as they watch the video. We present an algorithm that optimizes the path of a cropping window based on the collected eyetracking data, finds places to cut, and computes the size of the cropping window. We present results on a variety of video clips, including close-up and distant shots, and stationary and moving cameras. We conduct two experiments to evaluate our results. First, we eyetrack viewers on the result videos generated by our algorithm, and second, we perform a subjective assessment of viewer preference. These experiments show that viewer gaze patterns are similar on our result videos and on the original video clips, and that viewers prefer our results to an optimized crop-and-warp algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17269","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17269","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2634","fieldValue":" We study an extensive class of movement minimization problems that arise from many practical scenarios but so far have little theoretical study. In general, these problems involve planning the coordinated motion of a collection of agents (representing robots, people, map labels, network messages, etc.) to achieve a global property in the network while minimizing the maximum or average movement (expended energy). The only previous theoretical results about this class of problems are about approximation and are mainly negative: many movement problems of interest have polynomial inapproximability. Given that the number of mobile agents is typically much smaller than the complexity of the environment, we turn to fixed-parameter tractability. We characterize the boundary between tractable and intractable movement problems in a very general setup: it turns out the complexity of the problem fundamentally depends on the treewidth of the minimal configurations. Thus, the complexity of a particular problem can be determined by answering a purely combinatorial question. Using our general tools, we determine the complexity of several concrete problems and fortunately show that many movement problems of interest can be solved efficiently."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2634","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2634","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17270","fieldValue":"Sorkine-Hornung, Olga"}
