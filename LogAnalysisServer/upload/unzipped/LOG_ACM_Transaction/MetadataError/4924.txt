Therefore, data processing and network overload have become two urgent problems. To address these problems, extensive papers have been published on image analysis using deep learning, but only a few works have exploited this approach for video analysis. In this article, a hybrid-stream model is proposed to solve these problems for video analysis. Functionality of this model covers Data Preprocessing, Data Classification, and Data-Load-Reduction Processing. Specifically, an improved Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classification algorithm is designed to evaluate the importance of each video frame and video clip to enhance classification precision. Then, a reliable keyframe extraction mechanism will recognize the importance of each frame or clip, and decide whether to abandon it automatically by a series of correlation operations. The model will reduce data load to a dynamic threshold changed by σ, control the input size of the video in mobile Internet, and thus reduce network overload. Through experimental simulations, we find that the size of processed video has been effectively reduced and the quality of experience (QoE) has not been lowered due to a suitably selected parameter η. The simulation also shows that the model has a steady performance and is powerful enough for continuously growing multimedia big data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25776","fieldValue":" Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture for the next-generation Internet, providing unprecedented network programmability to handle the explosive growth of big data driven by the popularisation of smart mobile devices and the pervasiveness of content-rich multimedia applications. In order to quantitatively investigate the performance characteristics of SDN networks, several research efforts from both simulation experiments and analytical modelling have been reported in the current literature. Among those studies, analytical modelling has demonstrated its superiority in terms of cost-effectiveness in the evaluation of large-scale networks. However, for analytical tractability and simplification, existing analytical models are derived based on the unrealistic assumptions that the network traffic follows the Poisson process, which is suitable to model nonbursty text data, and the data plane of SDN is modelled by one simplified Single-Server Single-Queue (SSSQ) system. Recent measurement studies have shown that, due to the features of heavy volume and high velocity, the multimedia big data generated by real-world multimedia applications reveals the bursty and correlated nature in the network transmission. With the aim of capturing such features of realistic traffic patterns and obtaining a comprehensive and deeper understanding of the performance behaviour of SDN networks, this article presents a new analytical model to investigate the performance of SDN in the presence of the bursty and correlated arrivals modelled by the Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). The Quality-of-Service performance metrics in terms of the average latency and average network throughput of the SDN networks are derived based on the developed analytical model. To consider a realistic multiqueue system of forwarding elements, a Priority-Queue (PQ) system is adopted to model the SDN data plane. To address the challenging problem of obtaining the key performance metrics, for example, queue-length distribution of a PQ system with a given service capacity, a versatile methodology extending the Empty Buffer Approximation (EBA) method is proposed to facilitate the decomposition of such a PQ system to two SSSQ systems. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated through extensive simulation experiments. To illustrate its application, the developed model is then utilised to study the strategy of the network configuration and resource allocation in SDN networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25777","fieldValue":"Feng, Wu-chi"}
