{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4084","fieldValue":" Many natural signals, such as voiced speech and some musical instruments, are approximately periodic over short intervals. These signals are often described in mathematics by the sum of sinusoids (harmonics) with frequencies that are proportional to the fundamental frequency, or pitch. In sensor (microphone) array signal processing, the periodic signals are estimated from spatiotemporal samples regarding to the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal of interest. In this paper, we consider the problem of pitch and DOA estimation of quasi-periodic audio signals. In reallife scenarios, recorded signals are often contaminated by different types of noise, which challenges the assumption of white Gaussian noise in most state-of-the-art methods. We establish filtering methods based on noise statistics to apply to nonparametric spectral and spatial parameter estimates of the harmonics. We design minimum variance solutions with distortionless constraints to estimate the pitch from the frequency estimates, and to estimate the DOA from multichannel phase estimates of the harmonics. Applying this filtering method as the sum of weighted frequency and DOA estimates of the harmonics, we also design a joint DOA and pitch estimator. In white Gaussian noise, we derive even more computationally efficient solutions which are designed using the narrowband power spectrum of the harmonics. Numerical results reveal the performance of the estimators in colored noise compared with the Cram√©r--Rao lower bound. Experiments on real-life signals indicate the applicability of the methods in practical low local signal-to-noise ratios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4084","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4084","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4084","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4085","fieldValue":" This paper addresses the determined blind source separation problem and proposes a new effective method unifying independent vector analysis (IVA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). IVA is a state-of-the-art technique that utilizes the statistical independence between sources in a mixture signal, and an efficient optimization scheme has been proposed for IVA. However, since the source model in IVA is based on a spherical multivariate distribution, IVA cannot utilize specific spectral structures such as the harmonic structures of pitched instrumental sounds. To solve this problem, we introduce NMF decomposition as the source model in IVA to capture the spectral structures. The formulation of the proposed method is derived from conventional multichannel NMF (MNMF), which reveals the relationship between MNMF and IVA. The proposed method can be optimized by the update rules of IVA and single-channel NMF. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed method compared with IVA and MNMF in terms of separation accuracy and convergence speed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4085","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4085","fieldValue":"Determined blind source separation unifying independent vector analysis and nonnegative matrix factorization"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4085","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4085","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4086","fieldValue":" This paper presents a large-scale similarity search of professionally acted voices for computer-aided voice casting. The proposed voice casting system explores Gaussian mixture model-based acoustic models and multilabel recognition of perceived paralinguistic content (speaker states and speaker traits, e.g., age\/gender, voice quality, emotion) for the voice casting of professionally acted voices. First, acoustic models (universal background model, super-vector, i-vector) are constructed to model the acoustic space of voices, from which the similarity between voices can be measured directly in the acoustic space. Second, multiple binary classification of speaker traits and states is added to the acoustic models in order to represent the vocal signature of a voice, which is then used to measure the similarity between voices in the paralinguistic space. Finally, a similarity search is processed in order to determine the set of target actors that are the most similar to the voice of a source actor. In a subjective experiment conducted in the real-context of cross-language voice casting, the multilabel scoring system significantly outperforms the acoustic scoring system. This constitutes a proof of concept for the role of perceived para-linguistic categories in the perception of voice similarity."}
