Specifically, we demonstrate a weak attacker intercepting more than 80&percnt; of the data between peers and causing over 94&percnt; loss rate. We show that our attacks are practical through experimental validation on popular industrial and open-source products, with realistic network setups that involve NAT or tunneling and include concurrent legitimate traffic as well as packet losses. The interception attack requires a zombie agent behind the same NAT or tunnel-gateway as the victim destination; the DoS attack only requires a puppet agent, that is, a sandboxed applet or script running in web-browser context. The complexity of our attacks depends on the predictability of the IP Identification (ID) field which is typically implemented as one or multiple counters, as allowed and recommended by the IP specifications. The attacks are much simpler and more efficient for implementations, such as Windows, which use one ID counter for all destinations. Therefore, much of our focus is on presenting effective attacks for implementations, such as Linux, which use per-destination ID counters. We present practical defenses for the attacks presented in this article, the defenses can be deployed on network firewalls without changes to hosts or operating system kernel."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22365","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22365","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22366","fieldValue":"Al-Shaer, Ehab"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22366","fieldValue":" Real-time network- and host-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) transform a continuous stream of input data into meaningful and quantifiable anomaly scores. These scores are subsequently compared to a fixed detection threshold and classified as either benign or malicious. We argue that a real-time ADSâ\u20AC™ input changes considerably over time and a fixed threshold value cannot guarantee good anomaly detection accuracy for such a time-varying input. In this article, we propose a simple and generic technique to adaptively tune the detection threshold of any ADS that works on threshold method. To this end, we first perform statistical and information-theoretic analysis of network- and host-based ADSsâ\u20AC™ anomaly scores to reveal a consistent time correlation structure during benign activity periods. We model the observed correlation structure using Markov chains, which are in turn used in a stochastic target tracking framework to adapt an ADSâ\u20AC™ detection threshold in accordance with real-time measurements. We also use statistical techniques to make the proposed algorithm resilient to sporadic changes and evasion attacks. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we incorporate the proposed adaptive thresholding module into multiple ADSs and evaluate those ADSs over comprehensive and independently collected network and host attack datasets. We show that, while reducing the need of human threshold configuration, the proposed technique provides considerable and consistent accuracy improvements for all evaluated ADSs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22366","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22366","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22367","fieldValue":" Verifying that access-control systems maintain desired security properties is recognized as an important problem in security. Enterprise access-control systems have grown to protect tens of thousands of resources, and there is a need for verification to scale commensurately. We present techniques for abstraction-refinement and bound-estimation for bounded model checkers to automatically find errors in Administrative Role-Based Access Control (ARBAC) security policies. ARBAC is the first and most comprehensive administrative scheme for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems. In the abstraction-refinement portion of our approach, we identify and discard roles that are unlikely to be relevant to the verification question (the abstraction step). We then restore such abstracted roles incrementally (the refinement steps). In the bound-estimation portion of our approach, we lower the estimate of the diameter of the reachability graph from the worst-case by recognizing relationships between roles and state-change rules. Our techniques complement one another, and are used with conventional bounded model checking. Our approach is sound and complete: an error is found if and only if it exists. We have implemented our technique in an access-control policy analysis tool called Mohawk. We show empirically that Mohawk scales well to realistic policies, and provide a comparison with prior tools."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22367","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22367","fieldValue":"ACM"}
