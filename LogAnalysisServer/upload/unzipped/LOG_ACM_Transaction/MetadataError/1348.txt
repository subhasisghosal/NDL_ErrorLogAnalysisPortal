Nonetheless, appropriate refinement of light transfers, high quality meshing, and accurate visibility calculation can be challenging tasks. This is particularly true for scenes containing multiple light sources and scenes lit mainly by indirect light. We present solutions to these problems by extending a global visibility data structure, the Visibility Skeleton. This extension allows us to calculate exact point-to-polygon form-factors at vertices created by subdivision. The structures also provides visibility information for all light interactions, allowing intelligent refinement strategies. High-quality meshing is effected based on a perceptualy based ranking strategy which results in appropriate insertions of discontinuity curves into the meshes representing illumination. We introduce a hierarchy of triangulations that allows the generation of a hierarchical radiosity solution using accurate visibility and meshing. Results of our implementation show that our new algorithm produces high quality view-independent lighting solutions for direct illumination, for scenes with multiple lights and also scenes lit mainly by indirect illumination."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15172","fieldValue":"McCool, Michael D."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15172","fieldValue":" Monte Carlo sampling can be used to estimate solutions to global light transport and other rendering problems. However, a large number of observations may be needed to reduce the variance to acceptable levels. Rather than computing more observations within each pixel, if spatial coherence exists in image space it can be used to reduce visual error by averaging estimators in adjacent pixels. Anisotropic diffusion is a space-variant noise reduction technique that can selectively preserve texture, edges, and other details using a map of image coherence. The coherence map can be estimated from depth and normal information as well as interpixel color distance. Incremental estimation of the reduction in variance, in conjunction with statistical normalization of interpixel color distances, yields an energy-preserving algorithm that converges to a spatially nonconstant steady state."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15172","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15173","fieldValue":"Bloor, Malcolm I G"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15173","fieldValue":" Interactive design of practical surfaces using the partial differential equation (PDE) method is considered. The PDE method treats surface design as a boundary value problem (ensuring that surfaces can be defined using a small set of design parameters). Owing to the elliptic nature of the PDE operator, the boundary conditions imposed around the edges of the surface control the internal shape of the surface. Moreover, surfaces obtained in this manner tend to be smooth and fair. The PDE chosen has a closed form solution allowing the interactive manipulation of the surfaces in real time. Thus we present efficient techniques by which we show how surfaces of practical significance can be constructed interactively in real time. "}
