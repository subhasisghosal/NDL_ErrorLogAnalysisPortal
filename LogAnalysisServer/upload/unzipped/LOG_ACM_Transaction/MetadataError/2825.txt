Although a number of strategies addressing this problem have been investigated in several communities, we are not aware of any robust algorithm, and present the first such algorithm. Our calculation relies on the decomposition of the volume of the union into convex regions, namely the restrictions of the balls to their regions in the power diagram. Theoretically, we establish a formula for the volume of a restriction, based on Gauss' divergence theorem. The proof being constructive, we develop the associated algorithm. On the implementation side, we carefully analyse the predicates and constructions involved in the volume calculation, and present a certified implementation relying on interval arithmetic. The result is certified in the sense that the exact volume belongs to the interval computed. Experimental results are presented on hand-crafted models illustrating various difficulties, as well as on the 58,898 models found in the tenth of July 2009 release of the Protein Data Bank."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19306","fieldValue":"&alpha;-shapes"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19306","fieldValue":"&alpha;-shapes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19306","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19307","fieldValue":"Van De Geijn, Robert A."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19307","fieldValue":"Van Zee, Field G."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19307","fieldValue":" We present high-performance algorithms for up-and-downdating a Cholesky factor or QR factorization. The method uses Householder-like transformations, sometimes called hyperbolic Householder transformations, that are accumulated so that most computation can be cast in terms of high-performance matrix-matrix operations. The resulting algorithms can then be used as building blocks for an algorithm-by-blocks that allows computation to be conveniently scheduled to multithreaded architectures like multicore processors. Performance is shown to be similar to that achieved by a blocked QR factorization via Householder transformations."}
