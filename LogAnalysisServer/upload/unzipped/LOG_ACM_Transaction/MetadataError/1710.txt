The benchmark comprises a data set with 4,300 manually generated segmentations for 380 surface meshes of 19 different object categories, and it includes software for analyzing 11 geometric properties of segmentations and producing 4 quantitative metrics for comparison of segmentations. The paper investigates the design decisions made in building the benchmark, analyzes properties of human-generated and computer-generated segmentations, and provides quantitative comparisons of 7 recently published mesh segmentation algorithms. Our results suggest that people are remarkably consistent in the way that they segment most 3D surface meshes, that no one automatic segmentation algorithm is better than the others for all types of objects, and that algorithms based on non-local shape features seem to produce segmentations that most closely resemble ones made by humans."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16111","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16111","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16112","fieldValue":" We present a simple algorithm to compute the Hausdorff distance between complicated, polygonal models at interactive rates. The algorithm requires no assumptions about the underlying topology and geometry. To avoid the high computational and implementation complexity of exact Hausdorff distance calculation, we approximate the Hausdorff distance within a user-specified error bound. The main ingredient of our approximation algorithm is a novel polygon subdivision scheme, called Voronoi subdivision, combined with culling between the models based on bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). This cross-culling method relies on tight yet simple computation of bounds on the Hausdorff distance, and it discards unnecessary polygon pairs from each of the input models alternatively based on the distance bounds. This algorithm can approximate the Hausdorff distance between polygonal models consisting of tens of thousands triangles with a small error bound in real-time, and outperforms the existing algorithm by more than an order of magnitude. We apply our Hausdorff distance algorithm to the measurement of shape similarity, and the computation of penetration depth for physically-based animation. In particular, the penetration depth computation using Hausdorff distance runs at highly interactive rates for complicated dynamics scene."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16113","fieldValue":" We present a practical approach to isotropic tetrahedral meshing of 3D domains bounded by piecewise smooth surfaces. Building upon recent theoretical and practical advances, our algorithm interleaves Delaunay refinement and mesh optimization to generate quality meshes that satisfy a set of user-defined criteria. This interleaving is shown to be more conservative in number of Steiner point insertions than refinement alone, and to produce higher quality meshes than optimization alone. A careful treatment of boundaries and their features is presented, offering a versatile framework for designing smoothly graded tetrahedral meshes."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16113","fieldValue":"Interleaving Delaunay refinement and optimization for practical isotropic tetrahedron mesh generation"}
