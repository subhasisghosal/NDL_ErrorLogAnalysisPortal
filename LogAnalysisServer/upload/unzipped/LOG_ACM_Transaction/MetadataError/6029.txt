It offers increased tactile and proprioceptive feedback compared to a phone and, because it is always available, it should allow for quick audio output control without having to retrieve the phone from a pocket or bag. Despite this potential, there has been little investigation of on-body input for users with visual impairments. To assess blind usersâ\u20AC™ performance with on-body input versus touchscreen input, we conducted a controlled lab study with 12 sighted and 11 blind participants. Study tasks included basic pointing and drawing more complex shape gestures. Our findings confirm past work with sighted users showing that the hand results in faster pointing than the phone. Most important, we also show that: (1) the performance gain of the hand applies to blind users as well, (2) the accuracy of where the pointing finger first lands is higher with the hand than the phone, (3) on-hand pointing performance is affected by the location of targets, and (4) shape gestures drawn on the hand result in higher gesture recognition rates than those on the phone. Our findings highlight the potential of on-body input to support accessible nonvisual mobile computing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6011","fieldValue":"Kash, Ian A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6011","fieldValue":" When making a decision, a decision maker selects one of several possible actions and hopes to achieve a desirable outcome. To make a better decision, the decision maker often asks experts for advice. In this article, we consider two methods of acquiring advice for decision making. We begin with a method where one or more experts predict the effect of each action and the decision maker then selects an action based on the predictions. We characterize strictly proper decision making, where experts have an incentive to accurately reveal their beliefs about the outcome of each action. However, strictly proper decision making requires the decision maker use a completely mixed strategy to choose an action. To address this limitation, we consider a second method where the decision maker asks a single expert to recommend an action. We show that it is possible to elicit the decision makerâ\u20AC™s most preferred action for a broad class of preferences of the decision maker, including when the decision maker is an expected value maximizer."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6011","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6011","fieldValue":"ACM"}
