One potential design approach to improve the learnability of mobile devices is a Multi-Layered (ML) interface, where novice users start with a reduced-functionality interface layer that only allows them to perform basic tasks, before progressing to a more complex interface layer when they are comfortable. We studied the effects of a ML interface on older adultsâ\u20AC™ performance in learning tasks on a mobile device. We conducted a controlled experiment with 16 older (ages 65--81) and 16 younger participants (age 21--36), who performed tasks on either a 2-layer or a nonlayered (control) address book application, implemented on a commercial smart phone. We found that the ML interfaceâ\u20AC™s Reduced-Functionality layer, compared to the controlâ\u20AC™s Full-Functionality layer, better helped users to master a set of basic tasks and to retain that ability 30 minutes later. When users transitioned from the Reduced-Functionality to the Full-Functionality interface layer, their performance on the previously learned tasks was negatively affected, but no negative impact was found on learning new, advanced tasks. Overall, the ML interface provided greater benefit for older participants than for younger participants in terms of task completion time during initial learning, perceived complexity, and preference. We discuss how the ML interface approach is suitable for improving the learnability of mobile applications, particularly for older adults."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1437","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5129","fieldValue":" Attractors in gene regulatory networks represent cell types or states of cells. In system biology and synthetic biology, it is important to generate gene regulatory networks with desired attractors. In this paper, we focus on a singleton attractor, which is also called a fixed point. Using a Boolean network (BN) model, we consider the problem of finding Boolean functions such that the system has desired singleton attractors and has no undesired singleton attractors. To solve this problem, we propose a matrix-based representation of BNs. Using this representation, the problem of finding Boolean functions can be rewritten as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem and a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problem. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by a numerical example on a WNT5A network, which is related to melanoma. The proposed method provides us a basic method for design of gene regulatory networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5129","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5129","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5129","fieldValue":"ACM"}
