However, cost considerations make network providers less inclined to take robustness measures against failures that are unlikely to manifest, like several failures coinciding simultaneously in different geographic regions of their network. Considering networks embedded in a two-dimensional plane, we study the problem of finding a critical region---a part of the network that can be enclosed by a given elementary figure of predetermined size---whose destruction would lead to the highest network disruption. We determine that only a polynomial, in the input, number of nontrivial positions for such a figure needs to be considered and propose a corresponding polynomial-time algorithm. In addition, we consider region-aware network augmentation to decrease the impact of a regional failure. We subsequently address the region-disjoint paths problem, which asks for two paths with minimum total weight between a source (s) and a destination (d) that cannot both be cut by a single regional failure of diameter D (unless that failure includes s or d). We prove that deciding whether region-disjoint paths exist is NP-hard and propose a heuristic region-disjoint paths algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10764","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10765","fieldValue":" In order to simultaneously achieve good energy efficiency and high packet delivery performance, a multihop forwarding scheme should generally involve three design elements: media access mechanism, link estimation scheme, and routing strategy. Disregarding the low-duty-cycle nature of media access often leads to overestimation of link quality. Neglecting the bursty loss characteristic of wireless links inevitably consumes much more energy than necessary and underutilizes wireless channels. The routing strategy, if not well tailored to the above two factors, results in poor packet delivery performance. In this paper, we propose $L^2, a practical design of data forwarding in low-duty-cycle wireless sensor networks. L2 addresses link burstiness by employing multivariate Bernoulli link model. Further incorporated with synchronized rendezvous, L2 enables sensor nodes to work in a lazy mode, keep their radios off most of the time, and realize highly reliable forwarding by scheduling very limited packet transmissions. We implement L2 on a real sensor network testbed. The results demonstrate that L2$ outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of energy efficiency and network yield."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10765","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
