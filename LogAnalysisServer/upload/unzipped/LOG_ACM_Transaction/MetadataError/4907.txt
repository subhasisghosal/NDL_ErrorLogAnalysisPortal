The designing of visual-textual presentation layout is therefore becoming ubiquitous in both commercially printed publications and online digital magazines. However, handcrafting aesthetically compelling layouts still remains challenging for many small businesses and amateur users. This article presents a system to automatically generate visual-textual presentation layouts by investigating a set of aesthetic design principles, through which an average user can easily create visually appealing layouts. The system is attributed with a set of topic-dependent layout templates and a computational framework integrating high-level aesthetic principles (in a top-down manner) and low-level image features (in a bottom-up manner). The layout templates, designed with prior knowledge from domain experts, define spatial layouts, semantic colors, harmonic color models, and font emotion and size constraints. We formulate the typography as an energy optimization problem by minimizing the cost of text intrusion, the utility of visual space, and the mismatch of information importance in perception and semantics, constrained by the automatically selected template and further preserving color harmonization. We demonstrate that our designs achieve the best reading experience compared with the reimplementation of parts of existing state-of-the-art designs through a series of user studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25731","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25731","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25732","fieldValue":" Crowd system has motivated a surge of interests in many areas of multimedia, as it contains plenty of information about crowd scenes. In crowd systems, individuals tend to exhibit collective behaviors, and the motion of all those individuals is called collective motion. As a comprehensive descriptor of collective motion, collectiveness has been proposed to reflect the degree of individuals moving as an entirety. Nevertheless, existing works mostly have limitations to correctly find the individuals of a crowd system and precisely capture the various relationships between individuals, both of which are essential to measure collectiveness. In this article, we propose a collectiveness-measuring method that is capable of quantifying collectiveness accurately. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) we compute relatively accurate collectiveness by making the tracked feature points represent the individuals more precisely with a point selection strategy; (2) we jointly investigate the spatial-temporal information of individuals and utilize it to characterize the topological relationship between individuals by manifold learning; (3) we propose a stability descriptor to deal with the irregular individuals, which influence the calculation of collectiveness. Intensive experiments on the simulated and real world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to compute relatively accurate collectiveness and keep high consistency with human perception."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25732","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25733","fieldValue":" Today, the Internet is a large multimedia delivery infrastructure, with websites such as YouTube appearing at the top of most measurement studies. However, most traffic studies have ignored an important domain: adult multimedia distribution. Whereas, traditionally, such services were provided primarily via bespoke websites, recently these have converged towards what is known as â\u20ACœPorn 2.0â\u20AC?. These services allow users to upload, view, rate, and comment on videos for free (much like YouTube). Despite their scale, we still lack even a basic understanding of their operation. This article addresses this gap by performing a large-scale study of one of the most popular Porn 2.0 websites: YouPorn. Our measurements reveal a global delivery infrastructure that we have repeatedly crawled to collect statistics (on 183k videos). We use this data to characterise the corpus, as well as to inspect popularity trends and how they relate to other features, for example, categories and ratings. To explore our discoveries further, we use a small-scale user study, highlighting key system implications."}
