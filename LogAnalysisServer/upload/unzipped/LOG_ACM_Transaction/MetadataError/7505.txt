Extensive work has focused on two approaches to measuring bandwidth: measuring it hop-by-hop, and measuring it end-to-end along a path. Unfortunately, best-practice techniques for the former are inefficient and techniques for the latter are only able to observe bottlenecks visible at end-to-end scope. In this paper, we develop end-to-end probing methods which can measure bottleneck capacity bandwidth along arbitrary, targeted subpaths of a path in the network, including subpaths shared by a set of flows. We evaluate our technique through ns simulations, then provide a comparative Internet performance evaluation against hop-by-hop and end-to-end techniques. We also describe a number of applications which we foresee as standing to benefit from solutions to this problem, ranging from network troubleshooting and capacity provisioning to optimizing the layout of application-level overlay networks, to optimized replica placement."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9818","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9818","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9819","fieldValue":"Van Mieghem, Piet"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9819","fieldValue":" The union of all shortest path trees GUspt is the maximally observable part of a network when traffic follows shortest paths. Overlay networks such as peer to peer networks or virtual private networks can be regarded as a subgraph of GUspt. We investigate properties of GUspt in different underlying topologies with regular i.i.d. link weights. In particular, we show that the overlay GUspt in an Erdös-Rényi random graph Gp (N) is a connected GPc (N) where Pc ∼ log N\/N is the critical link density, an observation with potential for ad-hoc networks. Shortest paths and, thus also the overlay GUspt, can be controlled by link weights. By tuning the power exponent α of polynomial link weights in different underlying graphs, the phase transitions in the structure of GUspt are shown by simulations to follow a same universal curve FT (α) = Pr[GUspt is a tree]. The existence of a controllable phase transition in networks may allow network operators to steer and balance flows in their network. The structure of GUspt in terms of the extreme value index α is further examined together with its spectrum, the eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix of GUspt."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9819","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9819","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9819","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9820","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present NetQuest, a flexible framework for large-scale network measurement. We apply Bayesian experimental design to select active measurements that maximize the amount of information we gain about the network path properties subject to given resource constraints. We then apply network inference techniques to reconstruct the properties of interest based on the partial, indirect observations we get through these measurements. By casting network measurement in a general Bayesian decision theoretic framework, we achieve flexibility. Our framework can support a variety of design requirements, including i) differentiated design for providing better resolution to certain parts of the network; ii) augmented design for conducting additional measurements given existing observations; and iii) joint design for supporting multiple users who are interested in different parts of the network. Our framework is also scalable and can design measurement experiments that span thousands of routers and end hosts. We develop a toolkit that realizes the framework on PlanetLab. We conduct extensive evaluation using both real traces and synthetic data. Our results show that the approach can accurately estimate network-wide and individual path properties by only monitoring within 2%-10% of paths. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in providing differentiated monitoring, supporting continuous monitoring, and satisfying the requirements of multiple users."}
