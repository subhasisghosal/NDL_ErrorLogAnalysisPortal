{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25743","fieldValue":" The pervasive computing environment and wide network bandwidth provide users more opportunities to share screen content among multiple devices. In this article, we introduce a remote display system to enable screen sharing among multiple devices with high fidelity and responsive interaction. In the developed system, the frame-level screen content is compressed and transmitted to the client side for screen sharing, and the instant control inputs are simultaneously transmitted to the server side for interaction. Even if the screen responds immediately to the control messages and updates at a high frame rate on the server side, it is difficult to update the screen content with low delay and high frame rate in the client side due to non-negligible time consumption on the whole screen frame compression, transmission, and display buffer updating. To address this critical problem, we propose a layered structure for screen coding and rendering to deliver diverse screen content to the client side with an adaptive frame rate. More specifically, the interaction content with small region screen update is compressed by a blockwise screen codec and rendered at a high frame rate to achieve smooth interaction, while the natural video screen content is compressed by standard video codec and rendered at a regular frame rate for a smooth video display. Experimental results with real applications demonstrate that the proposed system can successfully reduce transmission bandwidth cost and interaction delay during screen sharing. Especially for user interaction in small regions, the proposed system can achieve a higher frame rate than most previous counterparts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25743","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25743","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25744","fieldValue":" This work discusses a distributed interactive video system that supports video annotation using simultaneous hyperlinking by multiple users. The users mark and annotate objects within the video with links to other media such as text, images, websites, or other videos. Annotations are visualized on the client user interface as an overlay close to the objects. Our system is intuitive to use; for example, it contains automatic object-tracking functionality that correctly positions the annotations, even when the form or location of an object changes. Thus, our first contribution discusses the adaptive object-tracking algorithm used for this repositioning. It shows improved precision and reliability in comparison to nonadaptive algorithms. A second key issue is to keep the system responsive when the number of concurrent annotators increases. Thus, we rely on the concept of eventual consistency between different network entities. While this weak form of consistency allows temporary inconsistencies, it ensures that a consistent state can be reached. Thus, the second contribution is the design and evaluation of our distributed interactive video system, which relies on the weak consistency paradigm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25745","fieldValue":" Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is a recently proposed standard that offers different versions of the same media content to adapt the delivery process over the Internet to dynamic bandwidth fluctuations and different user device capabilities. The peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm for video streaming allows us to leverage the cooperation among peers, guaranteeing the service of video requests with increased scalability and reduced cost. We propose to combine these two approaches in a P2P-DASH architecture, exploiting the potentiality of both. The new platform is made of several swarms and a different DASH representation is streamed within each of them; unlike client-server DASH architectures, where each client autonomously selects which version to download according to current network conditions and to its device resources, we put forth a new rate control strategy implemented at peer site to maintain a good viewing quality to the local user and to simultaneously guarantee the successful operation of the P2P swarms. The effectiveness of the solution is demonstrated through simulation and it indicates that the P2P-DASH platform is able to provide its users with very good performance, much more satisfying than in a conventional P2P environment where DASH is not employed. Through a comparison with a reference DASH system modeled via the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach, the new system is shown to outperform such reference architecture. To further validate the proposal, in terms of both robustness and scalability, system behavior is investigated in the critical condition of a flash crowd, showing that the strong upsurge of new users can be successfully revealed and gradually accommodated."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25745","fieldValue":"DASH"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25745","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25745","fieldValue":"ACM"}
