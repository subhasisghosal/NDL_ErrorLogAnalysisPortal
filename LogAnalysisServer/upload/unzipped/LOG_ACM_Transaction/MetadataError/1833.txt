Our method uses parameterized locomotion controllers that correspond to specific motion skills, such as jumping or obstacle avoidance. The controllers are created from motion capture data with reinforcement learning. A space-time planner determines the sequence in which controllers must be executed to reach a goal location, and admits a variety of cost functions to produce paths that exhibit different behaviors. By planning in space and time, the planner can discover paths through dynamically changing environments, even if no path exists in any static snapshot. By using parameterized controllers able to handle navigational tasks, the planner can operate efficiently at a high level, leading to interactive replanning rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16421","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16421","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16422","fieldValue":"Kim, Ig-Jae"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16422","fieldValue":" We present a photographic method to enhance intensity differences between objects at varying distances from the focal plane. By combining a unique capture procedure with simple image processing techniques, the detected brightness of an object is decreased proportional to its degree of defocus. A camera-projector system casts distinct grid patterns onto a scene to generate a spatial distribution of point reflections. These point reflections relay a relative measure of defocus that is utilized in postprocessing to generate a highlighted DOF photograph. Trade-offs between three different projector-processing pairs are analyzed, and a model is developed to help describe a new intensity-dependent depth of field that is controlled by the pattern of illumination. Results are presented for a primary single snapshot design as well as a scanning method and a comparison method. As an application, automatic matting results are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16422","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16422","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2557","fieldValue":" Given a sequencing of jobs on a single machine, each one with a weight, processing time, and a due date, the tardiness of a job is the time needed for its completion beyond its due date. We present an FPTAS for the basic scheduling problem of minimizing the total weighted tardiness when the number of distinct due dates is fixed. Previously, an FPTAS was known only for the case where all jobs have a common due date."}
