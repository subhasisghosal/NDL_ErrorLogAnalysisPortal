As these systems support higher and higher resolutions with more complex 3D graphics, a high-throughput and low-power memory system is essential for the mobile GPU. In this article, we propose to improve throughput\/watt in a mobile GPU memory system by using intelligent scheduling to reduce power and multi-band radio frequency interconnect (MRF-I) to offset any throughput degradation caused by our intelligent scheduling. Overall, we are able to improve throughput 17&percnt; up to 66&percnt; while increasing throughput per watt by an average of 18&percnt; up to 26&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1776","fieldValue":"DRAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1776","fieldValue":"GPU"}
