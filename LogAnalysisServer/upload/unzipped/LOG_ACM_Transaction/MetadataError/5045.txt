The definition of the discourse structure and the dialogue strategy consequently require the tagging of dialogue corpora in terms of dialogue acts. The tagging problem presents two basic variants: a batch variant (annotation of whole dialogues, in order to define dialogue strategy or study discourse structure) and an online variant (decoding of the dialogue act sequence of a given turn, in order to interpret user intentions). In the two variants is unusual having the segmentation of each turn into the dialogue meaningful units (segments) to which a dialogue act is assigned. In this paper we present the use of the N-Gram Transducer technique for tagging dialogues, without needing to provide a prior segmentation, in these two different variants (dialogue annotation and turn decoding). Experiments were performed in two corpora of different nature and results show that N-Gram Transducer models are suitable for these tasks and provide good performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3778","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3778","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1287","fieldValue":"Dai, Y S"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1287","fieldValue":"Xiang, Y P"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1287","fieldValue":" Computing systems and networks become increasingly large and complex with a variety of compromises and vulnerabilities. The network security and privacy are of great concern today, where self-defense against different kinds of attacks in an autonomous and holistic manner is a challenging topic. To address this problem, we developed an innovative technology called Bionic Autonomic Nervous System (BANS). The BANS is analogous to biological nervous system, which consists of basic modules like cyber axon, cyber neuron, peripheral nerve and central nerve. We also presented an innovative self-defense mechanism which utilizes the Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Entropy Awareness, etc. Equipped with the BANS, computer and network systems can intelligently self-defend against both known and unknown compromises\/attacks including denial of services (DoS), spyware, malware, and virus. BANS also enabled multiple computers to collaboratively fight against some distributed intelligent attacks like DDoS. We have implemented the BANS in practice. Some case studies and experimental results exhibited the effectiveness and efficiency of the BANS and the self-defense mechanism."}
