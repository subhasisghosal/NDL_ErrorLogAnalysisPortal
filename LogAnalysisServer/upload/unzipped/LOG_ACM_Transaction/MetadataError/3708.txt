Using a third language to link two other languages is a well-known solution and usually requires only two input bilingual dictionaries A-B and B-C to automatically induce the new one, A-C. This approach, however, has never been demonstrated to utilize the complete structures of the input bilingual dictionaries, and this is a key failing because the dropped meanings negatively influence the result. This article proposes a constraint approach to pivot-based dictionary induction where language A and C are closely related. We create constraints from language similarity and model the structures of the input dictionaries as a Boolean optimization problem, which is then formulated within the Weighted Partial Max-SAT framework, an extension of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). All of the encoded CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form), the predominant input language of modern SAT\/MAX-SAT solvers, formulas are evaluated by a solver to produce the target (output) bilingual dictionary. Moreover, we discuss alternative formalizations as a comparison study. We designed a tool that uses the Sat4j library as the default solver to implement our method and conducted an experiment in which the output bilingual dictionary achieved better quality than the baseline method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3097","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3097","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21932","fieldValue":" The Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) detection algorithm serves as a keystone for many graph analysis applications. The SCC execution time for large-scale graphs, as with many other graph algorithms, is dominated by memory latency. In this article, we investigate the design of a parallel hardware architecture for the detection of SCCs in directed graphs. We propose a design methodology that alleviates memory latency and problems with irregular memory access. The design is composed of 16 processing elements dedicated to parallel Breadth-First Search (BFS) and eight processing elements dedicated to finding intersection in parallel. Processing elements are organized to reuse resources and utilize memory bandwidth efficiently. We demonstrate a prototype of our design using the Convey HC-2 system, a commercial high-performance reconfigurable computing coprocessor. Our experimental results show a speedup of as much as 17Ã\u2014 for detecting SCCs in large-scale graphs when compared to a conventional sequential software implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21932","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21932","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21933","fieldValue":" Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems typically use orthogonal-triangular (QR) decomposition. In this article, we present an enhanced systolic array architecture to realize QR decomposition based on the Givens rotation (GR) method for a 4 Ã\u2014 4 real matrix. The coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm is adopted and modified to speed up and simplify the process of GR. To verify the function and evaluate the performance, the proposed architectures are validated on a Virtex 5 FPGA development platform. Compared to a commercial implementation of vectoring CORDIC, the enhanced vectoring CORDIC is presented that uses 37.7&percnt; less hardware resources, dissipates 71.6&percnt; less power, and provides a 1.8 times speedup while maintaining the same computation accuracy. The enhanced QR systolic array architecture based on the enhanced vectoring CORDIC saves 24.5&percnt; in power dissipation, provides a factor of 1.5-fold improvement in throughput, and the hardware efficiency is improved 1.45-fold with no accuracy penalty when compared to our previously proposed QR systolic array architecture."}
