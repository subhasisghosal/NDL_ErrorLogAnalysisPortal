In practice, a large-scale sensor network often has a complex and irregular topology, possibly containing obstacles\/holes. Convex network partitioning, also known as convex segmentation, is a technique to divide a network into convex regions in which traditional algorithms designed for a simple network geometry can be applied. Existing segmentation algorithms heavily depend on concave node detection, or sink extraction from the median axis\/skeleton, resulting in sensitivity of performance to network boundary noise. Furthermore, since they rely on the network's 2-D geometric properties, they do not work for 3-D cases. This paper presents a novel segmentation approach based on Morse function, bringing together the notions of convex components and the Reeb graph of a network. The segmentation is realized by a distributed and scalable algorithm, named CONSEL, for CONnectivity-based SEgmentation in Large-scale 2-D\/3-D sensor networks. In CONSEL, several boundary nodes first flood the network to construct the Reeb graph. The ordinary nodes then compute mutex pairs locally, generating a coarse segmentation. Next, neighboring regions that are not mutex pairs are merged together. Finally, by ignoring mutex pairs that lead to small concavity, we provide an approximate convex decomposition. CONSEL has a number of advantages over previous solutions: 1) it works for both 2-D and 3-D sensor networks; 2) it uses merely network connectivity information; 3) it guarantees a bound for the generated regions' deviation from convexity. We further propose to integrate network segmentation with existing applications that are oriented to simple network geometry. Extensive simulations show the efficacy of CONSEL in segmenting networks and in improving the performance of two applications: geographic routing and connectivity-based localization."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10725","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10725","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10725","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10726","fieldValue":" Application firewalls are increasingly used to inspect upper-layer protocols (as HTTP) that are the target or vehicle of several attacks and are not properly addressed by network firewalls. Like other security controls, application firewalls need to be carefully configured, as errors have a significant impact on service security and availability. However, currently no technique is available to analyze their configuration for correctness and consistency. This paper extends a previousmodel for analysis of packet filters to the policy anomaly analysis in application firewalls. Both rule-pair and multirule anomalies are detected, hence reducing the likelihood of conflicting and suboptimal configurations. The expressiveness of this model has been successfully tested against the features of Squid, a popularWeb caching proxy offering various access control capabilities. The tool implementing this model has been tested on various scenarios and exhibits good performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10726","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10726","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10726","fieldValue":"ACM"}
