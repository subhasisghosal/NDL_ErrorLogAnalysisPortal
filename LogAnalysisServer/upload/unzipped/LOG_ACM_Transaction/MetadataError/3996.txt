{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22870","fieldValue":" Models are key artifacts in Model-Driven Development (MDD) methods. To produce high-quality software by using MDD methods, quality assurance of models is of paramount importance. To evaluate the quality of models, defect detection is considered a suitable approach and is usually applied using reading techniques. However, these reading techniques have limitations and constraints, and new techniques are required to improve the efficiency at finding as many defects as possible. This article presents a case study that has been carried out to evaluate the use of a Functional Size Measurement (FSM) procedure in the detection of defects in models of an MDD environment. To do this, we compare the defects and the defect types found by an inspection group with the defects and the defect types found by the FSM procedure. The results indicate that the FSM is useful since it finds all the defects related to a specific defect type, it finds different defect types than an inspection group, and it finds defects related to the correctness and the consistency of the models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22870","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22870","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22871","fieldValue":" User Interface (UI) development methods are poorly integrated with standard software engineering practice. The differences in terms of artifacts involved, development philosophies, and lifecycles can often result in inconsistent system and UI specifications leading to duplication of effort and increased maintenance costs. To address such shortcomings, we propose an integrated development methodology for use case and task models. Use cases are generally used to capture functional requirements whereas task models specify the detailed user interactions with the UI. Our methodology can assist practitioners in developing software processes which allow these two kinds of artifacts to be developed in a codependent and integrated manner. We present our methodology, describe its semantic foundations along with a set of formal conformance relations, and introduce an automated verification tool."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22871","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22871","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3233","fieldValue":"OSullivan, Carol"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3233","fieldValue":" Attention is an important factor in the perception of static and dynamic scenes, which should, therefore, be taken into account when creating graphical images and animation. Recently, researchers have recognized this fact and have been investigating how the focus of attention can be measured, predicted, and exploited in graphical systems. In this article, we explore some preliminary strategies for developing an automatic means of predicting and exploiting attention in the processing of collisions and other dynamic events. Recent work on the perception of causality has shown that attention can change the way in which a dynamic scene consisting of collision events is perceived. We describe a series of experiments designed to determine the source of biases in the perception of anomalous collision dynamics and, in particular, whether attention plays a role. Using an eye-tracker, eye-movements were recorded while participants viewed animations of simple causal launching events in 3D involving two colliding spheres. Results indicated that there was indeed a definite pattern to the allocation of attention based on the nature of the event, which is promising for the goal of developing a predictive metric. As a follow-up, a paper-based experiment was carried out in which participants were asked to sketch the predicted post-collision trajectories of the same two spheres printed on paper. These experiments demonstrated that attention alone was not sufficient in determining performance, but rather the nature of the dynamic event itself also played a role."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3233","fieldValue":"ACM"}
