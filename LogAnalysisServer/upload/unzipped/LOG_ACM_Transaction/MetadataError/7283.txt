This is because the size and the heterogeneity of the Internet makes it time-consuming and difficult to devise traffic models and analytic tools which would allow us to work with summary statistics.We explore a method to side step these problems by combining sampling, modeling, and simulation. Our hypothesis is this: if we take a sample of the input traffic and feed it into a suitably scaled version of the system, we can extrapolate from the performance of the scaled system to that of the original.Our main findings are as follows. When we scale an IP network which is shared by short- and long-lived TCP-like and UDP flows and which is controlled by a variety of active queue management schemes, then performance measures such as queueing delay and drop probability are left virtually unchanged. We show this in theory and in simulations. This makes it possible to capture the performance of large networks quite faithfully using smaller scale replicas."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9383","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9383","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9383","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9384","fieldValue":" In wireless mobile networks, quantities such as call blocking probability, call dropping probability, handoff probability, handoff rate, and the actual call holding times for both complete and incomplete calls are very important performance parameters in the network performance evaluation and design. In the past, their analytical computations are given only when the classical exponential assumptions for all involved time variables are imposed. In this paper, we relax the exponential assumptions for the involved time variables and, under independence assumption on the cell residence times, derive analytical formulae for these parameters using a novel unifying analytical approach. It turns out that the computation of many performance parameters is boiled down to computing a certain type of probability, and the obtained analytical results can be easily applied when the Laplace transform of probability density function of call holding time is a rational function. Thus, easily computable results can be obtained when the call holding time is distributed with the mixed-Erlang distribution, a distribution model having universal approximation capability. More importantly, this paper develops a new analytical approach to performance evaluation for wireless networks and mobile computing systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9384","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9384","fieldValue":"PCS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9384","fieldValue":"ACM"}
