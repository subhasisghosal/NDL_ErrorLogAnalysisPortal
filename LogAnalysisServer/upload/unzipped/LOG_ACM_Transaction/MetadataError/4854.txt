{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25600","fieldValue":" The daunting volumes of community-contributed media contents on the Internet have become one of the primary sources for online advertising. However, conventional advertising treats image and video advertising as general text advertising by displaying relevant ads based on the contents of the Web page, without considering the inherent characteristics of visual contents. This article presents a contextual advertising system driven by images, which automatically associates relevant ads with an image rather than the entire text in a Web page and seamlessly inserts the ads in the nonintrusive areas within each individual image. The proposed system, called ImageSense, supports scalable advertising of, from root to node, Web sites, pages, and images. In ImageSense, the ads are selected based on not only textual relevance but also visual similarity, so that the ads yield contextual relevance to both the text in the Web page and the image content. The ad insertion positions are detected based on image salience, as well as face and text detection, to minimize intrusiveness to the user. We evaluate ImageSense on a large-scale real-world images and Web pages, and demonstrate the effectiveness of ImageSense for online image advertising."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25601","fieldValue":" Real-time detection, tracking, recognition, and activity understanding of moving objects from multiple sensors represent fundamental issues to be solved in order to develop surveillance systems that are able to autonomously monitor wide and complex environments. The algorithms that are needed span therefore from image processing to event detection and behaviour understanding, and each of them requires dedicated study and research. In this context, sensor fusion plays a pivotal role in managing the information and improving system performance. Here we present a novel fusion framework for combining the data coming from multiple and possibly heterogeneous sensors observing a surveillance area."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25601","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25601","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25602","fieldValue":"Huang, Jiun-Long"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25602","fieldValue":"Chiu, Shih-Chuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25602","fieldValue":"Shan, Man-Kwan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25602","fieldValue":" Score reduction is a process that arranges music for a target instrument by reducing original music. In this study we present a music arrangement framework that uses score reduction to automatically arrange music for a target instrument. The original music is first analyzed to determine the type of arrangement element of each section, then the phrases are identified and each is assigned a utility according to its type of arrangement element. For a set of utility-assigned phrases, we transform the music arrangement into an optimization problem and propose a phrase selection algorithm. The music is arranged by selecting appropriate phrases satisfying the playability constraints of a target instrument. Using the proposed framework, we implement a music arrangement system for the piano. An approach similar to Turing test is used to evaluate the quality of the music arranged by our system. The experiment results show that our system is able to create viable music for the piano."}
