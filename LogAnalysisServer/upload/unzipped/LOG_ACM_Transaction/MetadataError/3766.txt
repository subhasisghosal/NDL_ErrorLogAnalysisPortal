{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22161","fieldValue":" The major emphasis of public key infrastructure has been to provide a cryptographically secure means of authenticating identities. However, procedures for authorizing the holders of these identities to perform specific actions still need additional research and development. While there are a number of proposed standards for authorization structures and protocols such as KeyNote, SPKI, and SAML based on X.509 or other key-based identities, none have been widely adopted. As part of an effort to use X.509 identities to provide authorization in highly distributed environments, we have developed and deployed an authorization service based on X.509 identified users and access policy contained in certificates signed by X.509 identified stakeholders. The major goal of this system, called Akenti, is to produce a usable authorization system for an environment consisting of distributed resources used by geographically and administratively distributed users. Akenti assumes communication between users and resources over a secure protocol such as transport layer security (TLS) to provide mutual authentication with X.509 certificates. This paper explains the authorization model and policy language used by Akenti, and how we have implemented an Apache authorization module to provide Akenti authorization."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22161","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22161","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22161","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22162","fieldValue":" In this paper we present the Session Token Protocol (STOP), a new protocol that can assist in the forensic analysis of a computer involved in malicious network activity. It has been designed to help automate the process of tracing attackers who log on to a series of hosts to hide their identity. STOP utilizes the Identification Protocol infrastructure, improving both its capabilities and user privacy. On request, the STOP protocol saves user-level and application-level data associated with a particular TCP connection and returns a random token specifically related to that session. The saved data are not revealed to the requester unless the token is returned to the local administrator, who verifies the legitimacy of the need for the release of information. The protocol supports recursive traceback requests to gather information about the entire path of a connection. This allows an incident investigator to trace attackers to their home systems, but does not violate the privacy of normal users. This paper details the new protocol and presents implementation and performance results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22162","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22162","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22163","fieldValue":" In large organizations the administration of access privileges (such as the assignment of access rights to a user in a particular role) is handled cooperatively through distributed administrators in various different capacities. A quorum may be necessary, or a veto may be possible for such a decision. In this paper, we present two major contributions: We develop a role-based access control (RBAC) approach for specifying distributed administration requirements, and procedures between administrators, or administration teams, extending earlier work on distributed (modular) authorization. While a comprehensive specification in such a language is conceivable it would be quite tedious to evaluate, or analyze, their operational aspects and properties in practice. For this reason we create a new class of extended Petri Nets called Administration Nets (Adm-Nets) such that any RBAC specification of (cooperative) administration requirements (given in terms of predicate logic formulas) can be embedded into an Adm-Net. This net behaves within the constraints specified by the logical formulas, and at the same time, it explicitly exhibits all needed operational details such as allowing for an efficient and comprehensive formal analysis of administrative behavior. We introduce the new concepts and illustrate their use in several examples. While Adm-Nets are much more refined and (behaviorally) explicit than workflow systems our work provides for a constructive step towards novel workflow management tools as well. We demonstrate the usefulness of Adm-Nets by modeling typical examples of administration processes concerned with sets of distributed authorization rules."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22163","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22163","fieldValue":"ACM"}
