{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21564","fieldValue":" We propose a framework for dynamic composition of communication services that is well suited for facilitating research and prototyping on real experimental infrastructures of remotely configurable embedded devices. By using the concept of composability, our framework supports modular component development for various networking functions, thereby promoting code reuse. The framework consists of four components: the physical testbed, the module library, the declarative language, and the workbench. Its reference implementation, ProtoStack, developed using semantic web technologies, supports remote experimentation on sensor platform-based infrastructure and is thus well suited also for experimenters who do not possess their own physical experimentation infrastructure. We illustrate how ProtoStack supports research in service-oriented networks and cognitive networking. The cost of increased flexibility and prototyping speed of the protocol stack is paid in terms of increased memory footprint, processing speed, and energy consumption. Compared to the most related noncomposable approach, the CRime library used by ProtoStack has a 16--17&percnt; larger footprint, takes 2.4 times longer to execute an open-send-recv-close sequence, and consumes 1.6&percnt; more power in doing so. Even though with ProtoStack more resources are consumed by the node, the tradeoff in terms of prototyping speed pays off."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21564","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21564","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21565","fieldValue":" Troubleshooting unresponsive sensor nodes is a significant challenge in remote sensor network deployments. While prior work often targets low-end sensor networks, this article introduces a novel diagnostic tool, called the telediagnostic powertracer, geared for remote high-end sensing systems. Leveraging special properties of high-end systems, this in situ troubleshooting tool uses external power measurements to determine the internal health condition of an unresponsive node and the most likely cause of its failure. We develop our own low-cost power meter with low-bandwidth radio, propose both passive and active sampling schemes to measure the power consumption of the host node, and then report the measurements to a base station, hence allowing remote (i.e., tele-) diagnosis. The tool was deployed and tested in a remote solar-powered sensing system for acoustic and visual environmental monitoring. It was shown to successfully distinguish between several categories of failures that cause unresponsive behavior including energy depletion, antenna damage, radio disconnection, system crashes, and anomalous reboots. It was also able to determine the internal health conditions of an unresponsive node, such as the presence or absence of sensing and data storage activities (for each of multiple applications). The article explores the feasibility of building such a remote diagnostic tool from the standpoint of economy, scale, and diagnostic accuracy. The main novelty lies in its use of power consumption as a side channel, which has more availability than other I\/O ports, to diagnose sensing system failures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21566","fieldValue":" Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are commonly deployed in dynamic environments where events, such as moving sensor nodes and changing external interference, impact the performance, or Quality of Service (QoS), of the network. QoS is expressed by the values of multiple, possibly conflicting, network quality metrics, such as network lifetime and maximum latency of communicating a packet to the sink. Sufficient QoS should be provided by the WSN to ensure that the end-user can successfully use the WSN to perform its application. We propose a distributed reconfiguration approach that actively maintains a sufficient level of QoS at runtime for a heterogeneous WSN in a dynamic environment. Every node uses a feedback control strategy to resolve any difference between the current and required QoS of the network by adapting controllable parameters of the protocol stack. Example parameters are the transmission power and maximum number of packet retransmissions. Nodes collaborate such that, with the combined adaptations, the required network QoS is achieved. The behavior of the reconfiguration approach and the tradeoffs involved are analyzed in detail. With the use of simulations and experiments with actual deployments, we show that our approach allows a better optimization of QoS objectives while constraints are met; for example, it achieves the same packet loss with a significantly longer lifetime, compared to current (re-)configuration approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21566","fieldValue":"A Distributed Reconfiguration Approach for Quality-of-Service Provisioning in Dynamic Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks"}
