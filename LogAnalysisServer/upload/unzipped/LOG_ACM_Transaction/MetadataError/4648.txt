The optimal policy is the one that maximizes cell throughput while maintaining a level of fairness between the users in the cell. A discrete stochastic dynamic programming model for the HSDPA downlink scheduler is presented. Value iteration is then used to solve for the optimal scheduling policy. We use a FSMC (Finite State Markov Channel) to model the HSDPA downlink channel. A near-optimal heuristic scheduling policy is developed. Simulation is used to study the performance of the resulting heuristic policy and compare it to the computed optimal policy. The results show that the performance of the heuristic policy is very close to that of the optimal policy. The heuristic policy has much less computational complexity, which makes it easy to deploy, with only slight reduction in performance compared to the optimal policy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25014","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25015","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a constrained queueing model to investigate the performance of multihop wireless sensor networks. Specifically, the cross-layer interactions of rate admission control, traffic engineering, dynamic routing, and adaptive link scheduling are studied jointly with the proposed queueing model. In addition, the stochastic network utility maximization problem in wireless sensor networks is addressed within this framework. We propose an adaptive network resource allocation scheme, called the ANRA algorithm, which provides a joint solution to the multiple-layer components of the stochastic network utility maximization problem. We show that the proposed ANRA algorithm achieves a near-optimal solution, that is, (1-&epsis;) of the global optimum network utility where &epsis; can be arbitrarily small, with a trade-off with the average delay experienced in the network. The proposed ANRA algorithm enjoys the merit of self-adaptability through its online nature and thus is of particular interest for time-varying scenarios such as multihop wireless sensor networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25016","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of throughput-optimal cross-layer design of wireless networks. We propose a joint congestion control and scheduling algorithm that achieves a fraction $1\/d_I(G) of the capacity region, where dI(G) depends on certain structural properties of the underlying connectivity graph G of the wireless network, and also on the type of interference constraints. For a wide range of wireless networks, dI$(G) can be upper bounded by a constant, independent of the number of nodes in the network. The scheduling element of our algorithm is the maximal scheduling policy. Although this scheduling policy has been considered in several previous works, the challenges underlying its practical implementation in a fully distributed manner while accounting for necessary message exchanges have not been addressed in the literature. In this article, we propose two algorithms for the distributed implementation of the maximal scheduling policy accounting for message exchanges, and analytically show that they still can achieve the performance guarantee under the 1-hop and 2-hop interference models. We also evaluate the performance of our cross-layer solutions in more realistic network settings with imperfect synchronization under the Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) interference model, and compare with the standard layered approaches such as TCP over IEEE 802.11b DCF networks."}
