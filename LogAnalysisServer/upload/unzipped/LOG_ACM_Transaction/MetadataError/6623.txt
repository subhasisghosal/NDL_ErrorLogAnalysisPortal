Analysis of social events has real-world importance because events bring about impacts on many aspects of city life. Traditionally, detection and impact measurement of social events rely on social investigation, which involves considerable human effort. Recently, by analyzing messages in social networks, researchers can also detect and evaluate country-scale events. Nevertheless, the analysis of city-scale events has not been explored. In this article, we use human flow dynamics, which reflect the social activeness of a region, to detect social events and measure their impacts. We first extract human flow dynamics from taxi traces. Second, we propose a method that can not only discover the happening time and venue of events from abnormal social activeness, but also measure the scale of events through changes in such activeness. Third, we extract traffic congestion information from traces and use its change during social events to measure their impact. The results of experiments validate the effectiveness of both the event detection and impact measurement methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7638","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7638","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7639","fieldValue":" While on the go, people are using their phones as a personal concierge discovering what is around and deciding what to do. Mobile phone has become a recommendation terminal customized for individualsâ\u20AC\u201Dcapable of recommending activities and simplifying the accomplishment of related tasks. In this article, we conduct usage mining on the check-in data, with summarized statistics identifying the local recommendation challenges of huge solution space, sparse available data, and complicated user intent, and discovered observations to motivate the hierarchical, contextual, and sequential solution. We present a point-of-interest (POI) category-transition--based approach, with a goal of estimating the visiting probability of a series of successive POIs conditioned on current user context and sensor context. A mobile local recommendation demo application is deployed. The objective and subjective evaluations validate the effectiveness in providing mobile users both accurate recommendation and favorable user experience."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7639","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7639","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7640","fieldValue":" Participatory sensing systems can be used for concurrent event monitoring applications, like noise levels, fire, and pollutant concentrations. However, they are facing new challenges as to how to accurately detect the exact boundaries of these events, and further, to select the most appropriate participants to collect the sensing data. On the one hand, participantsâ\u20AC™ handheld smart devices are constrained with different energy conditions and sensing capabilities, and they move around with uncontrollable mobility patterns in their daily life. On the other hand, these sensing tasks are within time-varying quality-of-information (QoI) requirements and budget to afford the usersâ\u20AC™ incentive expectations. Toward this end, this article proposes an event-driven QoI-aware participatory sensing framework with energy and budget constraints. The main method of this framework is event boundary detection. For the former, a two-step heuristic solution is proposed where the coarse-grained detection step finds its approximation and the fine-grained detection step identifies the exact location. Participants are selected by explicitly considering their mobility pattern, required QoI of multiple tasks, and usersâ\u20AC™ incentive requirements, under the constraint of an aggregated task budget. Extensive experimental results, based on a real trace in Beijing, show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, while comparing with existing schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7640","fieldValue":"ACM"}
