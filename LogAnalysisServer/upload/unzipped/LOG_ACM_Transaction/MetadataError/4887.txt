Transcoding tasks require a lot of computation, and each task typically has its own real-time constraint. These make it difficult to manage transcoding, but the more efficient use of energy in servers is an imperative. We characterize transcoding workloads in terms of deadlines and computation times, and propose a new dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) scheme that allocates a frequency and a workload to each CPU with the aim of minimizing power consumption while meeting all transcoding deadlines. This scheme has been simulated, and also implemented in a Linux transcoding server, in which a frontend node distributes transcoding requests to heterogeneous backend nodes. This required a new protocol for communication between nodes, a DVFS management scheme to reduce power consumption and thread management and scheduling schemes which ensure that transcoding deadlines are met. Power measurements show that this approach can reduce system-wide energy consumption by 17&percnt; to 31&percnt;, compared with the Linux Ondemand governor."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25679","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25679","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25680","fieldValue":" For mobile multimedia systems, advances in battery technology have been much slower than those in memory, graphics, and processing power, making power consumption a major concern in mobile systems. The computational complexity of video codecs, which consists of CPU operations and memory accesses, is one of the main factors affecting power consumption. In this article, we propose a method that achieves near-optimal video quality while respecting user-defined bounds on the complexity needed to decode a video. We specifically focus on the motion compensation process, including motion vector prediction and interpolation, because it is the single largest component of computation-based power consumption. We start by formulating a scenario with a single receiver as a rate-distortion optimization problem and we develop an efficient decoder-complexity-aware video encoding method to solve it. Then we extend our approach to handle multiple heterogeneous receivers, each with a different complexity requirement. We test our method experimentally using the H.264 standard for the single receiver scenario and the H.264 SVC extension for the multiple receiver scenario. Our experimental results show that our method can achieve up to 97&percnt; of the optimal solution value in the single receiver scenario, and an average of 97&percnt; of the optimal solution value in the multiple receiver scenario. Furthermore, our tests with actual power measurements show a power saving of up to 23&percnt; at the decoder when the complexity threshold is halved in the encoder."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25680","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25680","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25681","fieldValue":" 3DTI Amphitheater is a live broadcasting system for dissemination of 3DTI (3D Tele-immersive) content. The virtual environment constructed by the system mimics an amphitheater in the real world, where performers interact with each other in the central circular stage, and the audience is placed in virtual seats that surround the stage. Users of the Amphitheater can be geographically dispersed and the streams created by the performer sites are disseminated in a P2P network among the participants. To deal with the high bandwidth demand and strict latency bound of the service, we identify the hierarchical priority of streams in construction of the content dissemination forest. Result shows that the Amphitheater outperforms prior 3DTI systems by boosting the application QoS by a factor of 2.8 while sustaining the same hundred-scale audience group."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25681","fieldValue":"ACM"}
