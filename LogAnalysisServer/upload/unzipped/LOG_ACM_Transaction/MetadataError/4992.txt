To overcome this problem they propose a new algorithm that provides separate error signals to each of the narrowband adaptive filters, generated by filtering the error signal using bandpass filters tuned to the control frequency of each of the adaptive filters. Although these bandpass filters do not introduce an additional phase shift at the control frequency they do introduce an additional group delay into the secondary path. It is shown in this correspondence that although introducing these bandpass filters allows an increase in the step size it may also limit the convergence speed compared to the conventional algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3657","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3657","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3658","fieldValue":" For music transcription or musical source separation, apart from knowing the multi-F0 contours, it is also important to know which F0 has been played by which instrument. This paper focuses on this aspect, i.e. given the polyphonic audio along with its multiple F0 contours, the proposed system clusters them so as to decide 'which instrument played when.' For the task of identifying the instrument or singers in the polyphonic audio, there are many supervised methods available. But many times individual source audio is not available for training. To address this problem, this paper proposes novel schemes using semi-supervised as well as unsupervised approach to source clustering. The proposed theoretical framework is based on auditory perception theory and is implemented using various tools like probabilistic latent component analysis and graph clustering, while taking into account various perceptual cues for characterizing a source. Experiments have been carried out over a wide variety of datasets - ranging from vocal to instrumental as well as from synthetic to real world music. The proposed scheme significantly outperforms a state of the art unsupervised scheme, which does not make use of the given F0 contours. The proposed semi-supervised approach also performs better than another semi-supervised scheme, which makes use of the given F0 information, in terms of computations as well as accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3658","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3658","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3659","fieldValue":" Broadband beamformers with small-size microphone arrays are known to be highly sensitive to microphone imperfections. A new method for the design of minimax broadband beamformers that are robust to microphone gain, phase, and position errors is proposed. In the method, the maximum variations in the microphone errors are used in formulating a convex optimization problem where the worst-case passband error is minimized under the constraint that the worst-case stopband error is below a prescribed level. To include the microphone imperfections in the optimization problem, we developed a suitable model that incorporates the variations due to the microphone errors and at the same time is efficient to compute. An important advantage of the proposed method is the availability of corresponding worst-case passband - and stopband-error bounds for the beamformer that has been designed; a second advantage is that it does not require the probability distributions of microphone errors. We then describe a two-phase method where the proposed method is used in the first phase to derive the passband and stopband error constraints for solving an optimization problem in the second phase where the white noise gain (WNG) of the beamformer is maximized. In our experiments, we compare beamformers designed using the proposed method, the two-phase method and a modified version of a competing method. Experimental results show that beamformers designed using the proposed method have much better performance than those of the modified competing method and comparable performance with those of the two-phase method; however, unlike the two-phase method, the proposed method provides the additional guarantee that the errors will always lie within the worst-case error bounds."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3659","fieldValue":"Design of minimax broadband beamformers that are robust to microphone gain, phase and position errors"}
