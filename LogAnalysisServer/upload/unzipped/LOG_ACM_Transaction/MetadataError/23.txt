{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11027","fieldValue":" This paper presents a distanceless networking approach for wireless sensor networks sparsely deployed in large areas. By leveraging rateless codes, we provide distanceless transmission to expand the communication range of sensor motes and fully exploit network diversity. We address a variety of practical challenges to accommodate rateless coding on resource-constrained sensor motes and devise a communication protocol to efficiently coordinate the distanceless link transmissions. We propose a new metric expected distanceless transmission time for routing selection and further adapt the distanceless transmissions to low duty-cycled sensor networks. We implement the proposed scheme in TinyOS on the TinyNode platform and deploy the sensor network in a real-world project, in which 12 wind measurement sensors are installed around a large urban reservoir of 2.5 Ã\u2014 3.0 km$ ^2$ to monitor the field wind distribution. Extensive experiments show that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for data collection in sparse sensor networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11027","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11028","fieldValue":"Ming Fai Wong, Felix"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11028","fieldValue":"Zhenming Liu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11028","fieldValue":"Mung Chiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11028","fieldValue":" We study a fundamental question that arises in social recommender systems: whether it is possible to simultaneously maximize: 1 an individual's benefit from using a social network, and 2 the efficiency of the network in disseminating information. To tackle this question, our study consists of three components. First, we introduce a stylized stochastic model for recommendation diffusion. Such a model allows us to highlight the connection between user experience at the individual level, and network efficiency at the macroscopic level. We also propose a set of metrics for quantifying both user experience and network efficiency. Second, based on these metrics, we extensively study the tradeoff between the two factors in a Yelp dataset, concluding that Yelp's social network is surprisingly efficient, though not optimal. Finally, we design a friend recommendation and news feed curation algorithm that can simultaneously address individuals' need to connect to high-quality friends, and service providers' need to maximize network efficiency in information propagation."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11028","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Depts. of Comput.
