The trustworthiness of the advisors is also modeled, using an approach that combines both personal and public knowledge and allows the relative weighting to be adjusted over time. Through a series of experiments that simulate e-marketplaces, including ones where sellers may vary their behavior over time, we are able to demonstrate that our proposed framework delivers effective seller recommendations to buyers, resulting in important buyer profit. We also propose limiting seller bids as a method for promoting seller honesty, thus facilitating successful selection of sellers by buyers, and demonstrate the value of this approach through experimental results. Overall, this research is focused on the technological aspects of electronic commerce and specifically on technology that would be used to manage trust."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7466","fieldValue":"A framework for trust modeling in multiagent electronic marketplaces with buying advisors to consider varying seller behavior and the limiting of seller bids"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1679","fieldValue":" Benchmarks set standards for innovation in computer architecture research and industry product development. Consequently, it is of paramount importance that these workloads are representative of real-world applications. However, composing such representative workloads poses practical challenges to application analysis teams and benchmark developers (1) real-world workloads are intellectual property and vendors hesitate to share these proprietary applications; and (2) porting and reducing these applications to benchmarks that can be simulated in a tractable amount of time is a nontrivial task. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a technique that automatically distills key inherent behavioral attributes of a proprietary workload and captures them into a miniature synthetic benchmark clone. The advantage of the benchmark clone is that it hides the functional meaning of the code but exhibits similar performance characteristics as the target application. Moreover, the dynamic instruction count of the synthetic benchmark clone is substantially shorter than the proprietary application, greatly reducing overall simulation time for SPEC CPU, the simulation time reduction is over five orders of magnitude compared to entire benchmark execution. Using a set of benchmarks representative of general-purpose, scientific, and embedded applications, we demonstrate that the power and performance characteristics of the synthetic benchmark clone correlate well with those of the original application across a wide range of microarchitecture configurations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1679","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1679","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7467","fieldValue":"Hoek, Wiebe van der"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7467","fieldValue":" This article investigates the conjecture that agents who make decisions in scenarios where trust is important can benefit from the use of a social structure, representing the social relationships that exist between agents. We propose techniques that can be used by agents to initially build and then progressively update such a structure in the light of experience. We describe an implementation of our techniques in the domain of the Agent ART testbed: we take two existing agents for this domain (â\u20ACœSimpletâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœConnectedâ\u20AC?) and compare their performance with versions that use our social structure (â\u20ACœSocialSimpletâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœSocialConnectedâ\u20AC?). We show that SocialSimplet and SocialConnected outperform their counterparts with respect to the quality of the interactions, the number of rounds won in a competition, and the total utility gained."}
