For applications in open space, the transfer function describing waves propagation has an explicit expression, which can be employed for beamformer design. However, the function becomes very complex in an indoor environment due to the effects of reverberation. In this paper, this problem is discussed. A method based on the image source method (ISM) is applied to model the room impulse responses (RIRs), which will act as the transfer function between source and sensor. The indoor beamformer design problem is formulated as a minimax optimization problem. We propose and study several optimization models based on the L1-norm to design the beamformer. We found that it is advantageous to separate early and late reverberations in the design process and better designs can be achieved. Several numerical experiments are presented using both simulated data and real recordings to evaluate the proposed methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3677","fieldValue":" Sparse wideband array design for sensor location optimization is highly nonlinear and it is traditionally solved by genetic algorithms (GAs) or other similar optimization methods. This is an extremely time-consuming process and an optimum solution is not always guaranteed. In this work, this problem is studied from the viewpoint of compressive sensing (CS). Although there have been CS-based methods proposed for the design of sparse narrowband arrays, its extension to the wideband case is not straightforward, as there are multiple coefficients associated with each sensor and they have to be simultaneously minimized in order to discard the corresponding sensor locations. At first, sensor location optimization for both general wideband beamforming and frequency invariant beamforming is considered. Then, sparsity in the tapped delay-line (TDL) coefficients associated with each sensor is considered in order to reduce the implementation complexity of each TDL. Finally, design of robust wideband arrays against norm-bounded steering vector errors is addressed. Design examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, with comparisons drawn with a GA-based design method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3677","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3677","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3678","fieldValue":"FanChiang, Yi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3678","fieldValue":"Wei, Cheng-Wen"}
