{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21293","fieldValue":" Cooperative communications represent a potential candidate to combat the effects of channel fading and to increase the transmit energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks with the downside being the increased complexity. In sensor networks the power consumed in the receiving and processing circuitry can constitute a significant portion of the total consumed power. By taking into consideration such overhead, an analytical framework for studying the energy efficiency trade-off of cooperation in sensor networks is presented. This trade-off is shown to depend on several parameters such as the receive and processing power, the required quality-of-service, the power amplifier loss, and several other factors. The analytical and numerical results reveal that for small distance separation between the source and destination, direct transmission is more energy efficient than relaying. The results also reveal that equal power allocation performs as well as optimal power allocation for some scenarios. The effects of the relay location and the number of employed relays on energy efficiency are also investigated in this work. Moreover, there are experimental results conducted to verify the channel model assumed in the article."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21293","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21293","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21294","fieldValue":"Ahn, Gahng-Seop"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21294","fieldValue":" We present BikeNet, a mobile sensing system for mapping the cyclist experience. Built leveraging the MetroSense architecture to provide insight into the real-world challenges of people-centric sensing, BikeNet uses a number of sensors embedded into a cyclist's bicycle to gather quantitative data about the cyclist's rides. BikeNet uses a dual-mode operation for data collection, using opportunistically encountered wireless access points in a delay-tolerant fashion by default, and leveraging the cellular data channel of the cyclist's mobile phone for real-time communication as required. BikeNet also provides a Web-based portal for each cyclist to access various representations of her data, and to allow for the sharing of cycling-related data (for example, favorite cycling routes) within cycling interest groups, and data of more general interest (for example, pollution data) with the broader community. We present: a description and prototype implementation of the system architecture based on customized Moteiv Tmote Invent motes and sensor-enabled Nokia N80 mobile phones; an evaluation of sensing and inference that quantifies cyclist performance and the cyclist environment; a report on networking performance in an environment characterized by bicycle mobility and human unpredictability; and a description of BikeNet system user interfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21294","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21294","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21295","fieldValue":" Anomalies in wireless sensor networks can occur due to malicious attacks, faulty sensors, changes in the observed external phenomena, or errors in communication. Defining and detecting these interesting events in energy-constrained situations is an important task in managing these types of networks. A key challenge is how to detect anomalies with few false alarms while preserving the limited energy in the network. In this article, we define different types of anomalies that occur in wireless sensor networks and provide formal models for them. We illustrate the model using statistical parameters on a dataset gathered from a real wireless sensor network deployment at the Intel Berkeley Research Laboratory. Our experiments with a novel distributed anomaly detection algorithm show that it can detect elliptical anomalies with exactly the same accuracy as that of a centralized scheme, while achieving a significant reduction in energy consumption in the network. Finally, we demonstrate that our model compares favorably to four other well-known schemes on four datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21295","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21295","fieldValue":"ACM"}
