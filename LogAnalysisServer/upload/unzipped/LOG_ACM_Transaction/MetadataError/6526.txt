Most previous works can only count moving people from a single camera, which cannot count still people or can fail badly when there is a crowd (i.e., heavy occlusion occurs). In this article, we build a system for robust and fast people counting under occlusion through multiple cameras. To improve the reliability of human detection from a single camera, we use a dimensionality reduction method on the multilevel edge and texture features to handle the large variations in human appearance and poses. To accelerate the detection speed, we propose a novel two-stage cascade-of-rejectors method. To handle the heavy occlusion in crowded scenes, we present a fusion method with error tolerance to combine human detection from multiple cameras. To improve the speed and accuracy of moving people counting, we combine our multiview fusion detection method with particle tracking to count the number of people moving in\/out the camera view (â\u20ACœborder controlâ\u20AC?). Extensive experiments and analyses show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in single- and multicamera datasets for both speed and reliability. We also design a deployed system for fast and reliable people (still or moving) counting by using multiple cameras."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7396","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7396","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7397","fieldValue":" Future Web business models involve virtual environments where entities interact in order to sell or buy information goods. Such environments are known as Information Markets (IMs). Intelligent agents are used in IMs for representing buyers or information providers (sellers). We focus on the decisions taken by the buyer in the purchase negotiation process with sellers. We propose a reasoning mechanism on the offers (prices of information goods) issued by sellers based on fuzzy logic. The buyerâ\u20AC™s knowledge on the negotiation process is modeled through fuzzy sets. We propose a fuzzy inference engine dealing with the decisions that the buyer takes on each stage of the negotiation process. The outcome of the proposed reasoning method indicates whether the buyer should accept or reject the sellersâ\u20AC™ offers. Our findings are very promising for the efficiency of automated transactions undertaken by intelligent agents."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7398","fieldValue":" We study a novel problem of batch mode active learning for networked data. In this problem, data instances are connected with links and their labels are correlated with each other, and the goal of batch mode active learning is to exploit the link-based dependencies and node-specific content information to actively select a batch of instances to query the user for learning an accurate model to label unknown instances in the network. We present three criteria (i.e., minimum redundancy, maximum uncertainty, and maximum impact) to quantify the informativeness of a set of instances, and formalize the batch mode active learning problem as selecting a set of instances by maximizing an objective function which combines both link and content information. As solving the objective function is NP-hard, we present an efficient algorithm to optimize the objective function with a bounded approximation rate. To scale to real large networks, we develop a parallel implementation of the algorithm. Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach."}
