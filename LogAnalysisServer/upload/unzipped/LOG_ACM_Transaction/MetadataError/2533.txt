{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18555","fieldValue":" FIDISOL is a program package for the solution of nonlinear systems of two-dimensional and three-dimensional elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with nonlinear boundary conditions (BCs) on the boundaries of a rectangular domain. A finite difference method (FDM) with an arbitrary grid and arbitrary consistency order is used, these are either prescribed by the user or are self-adapted for a given relative tolerance. FIDISOL has been designed to be fully vectorizable on vector computers. In this paper we discuss several problems from the viewpoint of software development and user interface, for example, how to deliver the PDEs and BCs to FIDISOL and how to allow a flexible use by a suitable parameter list."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18555","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18555","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18556","fieldValue":" We describe a specialization of the primal truncated Newton algorithm for solving nonlinear optimization problems on networks with gains. The algorithm and its implementation are able to capitalize on the special structure of the constraints. Extensive computational tests show that the algorithm is capable of solving very large problems. Testing of numerous tactical issues are described, including maximal basis, projected line search, and pivot strategies. Comparisons with NLPNET, a nonlinear network code, and MINOS, a general-purpose nonlinear programming code, are also included."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18556","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18556","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18557","fieldValue":" A new pseudorandom number generator, the Multiple Prime Random Number Generator, has been developed; it is efficient, conceptually simple, flexible, and easy to program. The generator utilizes cycles around prime numbers to guarantee the length of the period, which can easily be programmed to surpass the maximum period of any other presently available random number generator. There are minimum limits placed on the seed values of the variables because the period of the generator is not a function of the initial values of the variables. The generator passes thirteen standard random number generator tests. It requires only about fifteen lines of FORTRAN code to program and utilizes programming language constructs found in most major languages. Finally, it compares very favorably to the fastest of the other available generators."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18557","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18557","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2743","fieldValue":"Segal-Halevi, Erel"}
