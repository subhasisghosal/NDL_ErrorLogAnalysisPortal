MLC and TLC flash technology made it possible to store multiple bits in the same silicon area as SLC, thus reducing the cost per amount of data stored. However, at current sub-20nm technology nodes, MLC flash devices fail to provide the levels of raw reliability, mainly cycling endurance, that are required by typical enterprise applications. Advanced signal processing and coding schemes are needed to improve the flash bit error rate and thus elevate the device reliability to the desired level. In this article, we report on the use of adaptive voltage thresholds and cell-to-cell interference cancellation in the read operation of NAND flash devices. We discuss how the optimal read voltage thresholds can be determined and assess the benefit of cancelling cell-to-cell interference in terms of cycling endurance, data retention, and resilience to read disturb."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13447","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13447","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13448","fieldValue":" Resistive random access memory (ReRAM) technology is an emerging candidate for next-generation nonvolatile memory (NVM) architecture due to its simple structure, low programming voltage, fast switching speed, high on\/off ratio, excellent scalability, good endurance, and great compatibility with silicon CMOS technology. The most attractive of the characteristics of ReRAM is its cross-point structure, which features a $4F^2$ cell size. In a cross-point structure, the existence of sneak current and resulting voltage loss due to the wire's resistance might cause read and write failures if not designed properly. In addition, a robust ReRAM design needs to deal with both soft and hard errors. In this article, we summarize mechanisms of both soft and hard errors of ReRAM cells and propose a unified model to characterize different failure behaviors. We quantitatively analyze the impact of cell failure types on the reliability of the cross-point array. We also propose an error-resilient architecture, which avoids unnecessary writes in the hard error detection unit. Assuming constant soft error rate, our approach can extend the lifetime of ReRAM up to 75&percnt; over a design without hard error detection and up to 12&percnt; over the design with a â\u20ACœwrite-verifyâ\u20AC? detection mechanism. Our approach yields greater significant lifetime improvement when considering postcycling retention degradation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13448","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13448","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13449","fieldValue":" The feasibility of designing digitally programmable delay elements (PDEs) employing neuron-MOS mechanism is investigated in this work. By coupling the capacitors on the gate of the MOS transistor, the current flowing through the transistor can be digitally tuned without additional static power consumption. Various switching delays are generated by a clock buffer stage in this manner. Two types of neuron-MOS-based PDEs are suggested in this article. One of them is realized by directly applying capacitor-coupling technology on the transistors of an inverter as a clock buffer. The delay programmability is realized by tuning the charging\/discharging current through the neuron-MOS inverter digitally. Since no additional transistor is introduced into the charging\/discharging path, the performance fluctuation due to process variations on MOS transistors is reduced. The temperature effect is also partially compensated by the proposed neuron-MOS implementation. Another type of PDE circuit is proposed by employing a reliable reference-current-generator, where the neuron-MOS transistor acts as a linearly tunable resistance. A stable reference current is generated and used for charging\/discharging the inverter as a clock buffer. As a result, the switching delay of the inverter is linearly programmed by digital input patterns. In general, both types of suggested PDE circuits achieve improved or fair performances over the robustness, power consumption, and linearity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13449","fieldValue":"ACM"}
