Given a character sequence S of length L and a pattern P of length l, we consider P a frequently occurring pattern in S if the probability of observing P given a randomly picked length-l subsequence of S exceeds a certain threshold. In many applications, particularly those related to bioinformatics, interesting patterns are periodic with a gap requirement. That is to say, the characters in P should match subsequences of S in such a way that the matching characters in S are separated by gaps of more or less the same size. We show the complexity of the mining problem and discuss why traditional mining algorithms are computationally infeasible. We propose practical algorithms for solving the problem and study their characteristics. We also present a case study in which we apply our algorithms on some DNA sequences. We discuss some interesting patterns obtained from the case study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7827","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7827","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7828","fieldValue":"Huang, Jen-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7828","fieldValue":"Dai, Bi-Ru"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7828","fieldValue":"Chen, Ming-Syan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7828","fieldValue":" We investigate the general model of mining associations in a temporal database, where the exhibition periods of items are allowed to be different from one to another. The database is divided into partitions according to the time granularity imposed. Such temporal association rules allow us to observe short-term but interesting patterns that are absent when the whole range of the database is evaluated altogether. Prior work may omit some temporal association rules and thus have limited practicability. To remedy this and to give more precise frequent exhibition periods of frequent temporal itemsets, we devise an efficient algorithm Twain (standing for TWo end AssocIation miNer.) Twain not only generates frequent patterns with more precise frequent exhibition periods, but also discovers more interesting frequent patterns. Twain employs Start time and End time of each item to provide precise frequent exhibition period while progressively handling itemsets from one partition to another. Along with one scan of the database, Twain can generate frequent 2-itemsets directly according to the cumulative filtering threshold. Then, Twain adopts the scan reduction technique to generate all frequent k-itemsets (k > 2) from the generated frequent 2-itemsets. Theoretical properties of Twain are derived as well in this article. The experimental results show that Twain outperforms the prior works in the quality of frequent patterns, execution time, I\/O cost, CPU overhead and scalability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7828","fieldValue":"ACM"}
