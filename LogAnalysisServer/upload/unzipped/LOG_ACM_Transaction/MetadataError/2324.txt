{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17658","fieldValue":" We present an approach for adding directed gaze movements to characters animated using full-body motion capture. Our approach provides a comprehensive authoring solution that automatically infers plausible directed gaze from the captured body motion, provides convenient controls for manual editing, and adds synthetic gaze movements onto the original motion. The foundation of the approach is an abstract representation of gaze behavior as a sequence of gaze shifts and fixations toward targets in the scene. We present methods for automatic inference of this representation by analyzing the head and torso kinematics and scene features. We introduce tools for convenient editing of the gaze sequence and target layout that allow an animator to adjust the gaze behavior without worrying about the details of pose and timing. A synthesis component translates the gaze sequence into coordinated movements of the eyes, head, and torso, and blends these with the original body motion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our inference methods, the efficiency of the authoring process, and the quality of the resulting animation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17658","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17658","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17659","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17659","fieldValue":" Marker-based and marker-less optical skeletal motion-capture methods use an outside-in arrangement of cameras placed around a scene, with viewpoints converging on the center. They often create discomfort with marker suits, and their recording volume is severely restricted and often constrained to indoor scenes with controlled backgrounds. Alternative suit-based systems use several inertial measurement units or an exoskeleton to capture motion with an inside-in setup, i.e. without external sensors. This makes capture independent of a confined volume, but requires substantial, often constraining, and hard to set up body instrumentation. Therefore, we propose a new method for real-time, marker-less, and egocentric motion capture: estimating the full-body skeleton pose from a lightweight stereo pair of fisheye cameras attached to a helmet or virtual reality headset - an optical inside-in method, so to speak. This allows full-body motion capture in general indoor and outdoor scenes, including crowded scenes with many people nearby, which enables reconstruction in larger-scale activities. Our approach combines the strength of a new generative pose estimation framework for fisheye views with a ConvNet-based body-part detector trained on a large new dataset. It is particularly useful in virtual reality to freely roam and interact, while seeing the fully motion-captured virtual body."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17659","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17659","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2670","fieldValue":"Mitchell, Joseph S B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2670","fieldValue":" In the relay placement problem, the input is a set of sensors and a number r &ges; 1, the communication range of a relay. In the one-tier version of the problem, the objective is to place a minimum number of relays so that between every pair of sensors there is a path through sensors and\/or relays such that the consecutive vertices of the path are within distance r if both vertices are relays and within distance 1 otherwise. The two-tier version adds the restrictions that the path must go through relays, and not through sensors. We present a 3.11-approximation algorithm for the one-tier version and a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the two-tier version. We also show that the one-tier version admits no PTAS, assuming P â\u2030  NP."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2670","fieldValue":"ACM"}
