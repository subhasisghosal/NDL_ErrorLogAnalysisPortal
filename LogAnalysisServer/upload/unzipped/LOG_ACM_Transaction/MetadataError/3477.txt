{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21371","fieldValue":" This article describes a novel approach to localizing networks of embedded cameras and sensors. In this scheme, the cameras and the sensors are equipped with controllable light sources (either visible or infrared), which are used for signaling. Each camera node can then determine automatically the bearing to all of the nodes that are visible from its vantage point. By fusing these measurements with the measurements obtained from onboard accelerometers, the camera nodes are able to determine the relative positions and orientations of other nodes in the network. The method uses angular measurements derived from images, rather than range measurements derived from time-of-flight or signal attenuation. The scheme can be implemented relatively easily with commonly available components, and it scales well since the localization calculations exploit the sparse structure of the system of measurements. Additionally, the method provides estimates of camera orientation which cannot be determined solely from range measurements. The localization technology could serve as a basic capability on which higher-level applications could be built. The method could also be used to automatically survey the locations of sensors of interest, to implement distributed surveillance systems, or to analyze the structure of a scene, based on images obtained from multiple registered vantage points. It also provides a mechanism for integrating the imagery obtained from the cameras with the measurements obtained from distributed sensors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21371","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21371","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21372","fieldValue":" We consider a small extent sensor network for event detection, in which nodes periodically take samples and then contend over a random access network to transmit their measurement packets to the fusion center. We consider two procedures at the fusion center for processing the measurements. The Bayesian setting, is assumed, that is, the fusion center has a prior distribution on the change time. In the first procedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion center is network--oblivious and makes a decision only when a complete vector of measurements taken at a sampling instant is available. In the second procedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion center is network--aware and processes measurements as they arrive, but in a time-causal order. In this case, the decision statistic depends on the network delays, whereas in the network--oblivious case, the decision statistic does not. This yields a Bayesian change-detection problem with a trade-off between the random network delay and the decision delay that is, a higher sampling rate reduces the decision delay but increases the random access delay. Under periodic sampling, in the network--oblivious case, the structure of the optimal stopping rule is the same as that without the network, and the optimal change detection delay decouples into the network delay and the optimal decision delay without the network. In the network--aware case, the optimal stopping problem is analyzed as a partially observable Markov decision process, in which the states of the queues and delays in the network need to be maintained. A sufficient decision statistic is the network state and the posterior probability of change having occurred, given the measurements received and the state of the network. The optimal regimes are studied using simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21372","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21372","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21373","fieldValue":"Chang, Shih-Ying"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21373","fieldValue":"Lin, Yue-Hsun"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21373","fieldValue":"Sun, Hung-Min"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21373","fieldValue":"Wu, Mu-En"}
