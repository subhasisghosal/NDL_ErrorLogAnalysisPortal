This article investigates the potential for deviating from the conventional wisdom of writing concurrency bug--free, parallel programs. It explores the benefit of accepting buggy but approximately correct parallel programs by leveraging the inherent tolerance of emerging parallel applications to inaccuracy in computations. Under algorithmic noise tolerance, a new class of concurrency bugs, accuracy bugs, degrade the accuracy of computation (often at acceptable levels) rather than causing catastrophic termination. This study demonstrates how embracing accuracy bugs affects the application output quality and performance and analyzes the impact on execution semantics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12204","fieldValue":"Melliar-Smith, P.

This consistent message order is maintained in the presenceof network partitioning and remerging, and of processor failure andrecovery. The protocol provides accurate topology change information aspart of the global total order of messages. It addresses the issue ofscalability and achieves a latency that increases logarithmically withsystem size by exploiting process group locality and selectiveforwarding of messages through the gateways. Pseudocode for the protocoland an evaluation of its performance are given."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12204","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12204","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12205","fieldValue":" Recent archaeological discoveries on the island of Paxos reveal that the parliament functioned despite the peripatetic propensity of its part-time legislators. The legislators maintained consistent copies of the parliamentary record, despite their frequent forays from the chamber and the forgetfulness of their messengers. The Paxon parliament's protocol provides a new way of implementing the state machine approach to the design of distributed systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12205","fieldValue":"ACM"}
