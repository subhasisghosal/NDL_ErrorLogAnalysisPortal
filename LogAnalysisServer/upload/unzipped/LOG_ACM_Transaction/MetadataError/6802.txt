It has become increasingly important to understand how WOM content and metrics influence consumer purchases and product sales. By integrating marketing theories with text mining techniques, we propose a set of novel measures that focus on sentiment divergence in consumer product reviews. To test the validity of these metrics, we conduct an empirical study based on data from Amazon.com and BN.com (Barnes & Noble). The results demonstrate significant effects of our proposed measures on product sales. This effect is not fully captured by nontextual review measures such as numerical ratings. Furthermore, in capturing the sales effect of review content, our divergence metrics are shown to be superior to and more appropriate than some commonly used textual measures the literature. The findings provide important insights into the business impact of social media and user-generated content, an emerging problem in business intelligence research. From a managerial perspective, our results suggest that firms should pay special attention to textual content information when managing social media and, more importantly, focus on the right measures."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8166","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8166","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8166","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8167","fieldValue":" Virtual team members increasingly rely on virtual workspace tools to coordinate knowledge that each individual brings to the team. How the use of these tools affects knowledge coordination within virtual teams is not well understood. We distinguish between tools as features and the use of the virtual workspace as providing affordances for behaviors. Using situational awareness theory, we hypothesized two affordances of virtual workspaces that facilitate knowledge coordination. Using trading zone theory, we hypothesized two forms of trading zones created by features of virtual workspaces and the impact of these trading zones on the creation of affordances for team members. Members of 54 teams were asked about the affordances of the virtual workspace, and team leaders were asked about specific tools provided to the team. Our hypothesized model was supported: the different forms of trading zones were differentially related to the different affordances and on affordances were related to knowledge coordination satisfaction. Theoretical implications focus on the distinction between features and affordances and on the identification of specific features that affect specific affordances. Practical implications for managers and engineers supporting virtual teams include the utility of becoming knowledgeable about different forms of trading zones that virtual workspaces can provide and understanding the relationship between trading zones and different affordances."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8167","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8167","fieldValue":"ACM"}
