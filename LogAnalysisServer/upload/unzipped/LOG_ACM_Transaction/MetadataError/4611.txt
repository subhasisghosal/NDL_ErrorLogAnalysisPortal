We then use these to construct perfect samplers for several queueing and network models: Poisson arrivals and exponential service times, several types of customers, and a trunk reservation protocol for accepting new customers; a similar protocol on a network switching model; a queue with a general arrival process; and a queue with both general arrivals and service times. Our samplers give effective ways to generate random samples from the steady-state distributions of these queues."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24919","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24920","fieldValue":" This note corrects an error in Ghosh and Henderson [2003]."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24920","fieldValue":" This note corrects an error in Ghosh and Henderson [2003]."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24920","fieldValue":"Corrigendum: Behavior of the NORTA method for correlated random vector generation as the dimension increases"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24920","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24920","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24921","fieldValue":" In this article we propose a new concept called automated container transportation system between inland port and terminals (ACTIPOT) which involves the use of automated trucks to transfer containers between an inland port and container terminals. The inland port is located a few miles away from the terminals and is used for storing and processing import\/export containers before distribution to customers or transfer to the terminals. We design and analyze the ACTIPOT system with particular attention paid to the overall supervisory controller that synchronizes all the operations inside the ACTIPOT system. We employ the technique of truck platooning in order to simplify the control of the overall system and to minimize the possibility of deadlocks, congestion, and failures. A microscopic simulation model is developed and used to demonstrate the overall performance of the ACTIPOT system. The contribution of this article is the design, analysis, and evaluation of the new concept ACTIPOT."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24921","fieldValue":"ACM"}
