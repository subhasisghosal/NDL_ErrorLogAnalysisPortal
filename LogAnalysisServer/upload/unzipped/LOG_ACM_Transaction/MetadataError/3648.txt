Systems with reconfigurability have unique opportunities for adapting to such effects. Required, however, are low-cost, fine-grained methods for sensing physical parameters. This article presents powerful, novel approaches to online sensing, including methods for designing compact reconfigurable sensors, low-cost threshold detection, and several enhanced measurement procedures. Together, the approaches help enable systems to autonomously uncover a wealth of physical information. A highly efficient counter and improved ring oscillator are introduced, enabling an entire sensor node in just 8 Virtex-5 LUTs. We describe how variations can be measured in delay, temperature, switching-induced IR drop, and leakage-induced IR drop. We demonstrate the proposed approach with an experimental system based on a Virtex-5, instrumented with over 100 sensors at an overhead of only 1.3&percnt;. Results from thermally controlled experiments provide some surprising insights and illustrate the utility of the approach. Online sensing can help open the door to physically adaptive computing, including fine-grained power, reliability, and health management schemes for systems on a chip."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21803","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21803","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21804","fieldValue":" High-throughput and area-efficient designs of hash functions and corresponding mechanisms for Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are in high demand due to new security protocols that have arisen and call for security services in every transmitted data packet. For instance, IPv6 incorporates the IPSec protocol for secure data transmission. However, the IPSec's performance bottleneck is the HMAC mechanism which is responsible for authenticating the transmitted data. HMAC's performance bottleneck in its turn is the underlying hash function. In this article a high-throughput and small-size SHA-256 hash function FPGA design and the corresponding HMAC FPGA design is presented. Advanced optimization techniques have been deployed leading to a SHA-256 hashing core which performs more than 30&percnt; better, compared to the next better design. This improvement is achieved both in terms of throughput as well as in terms of throughput\/area cost factor. It is the first reported SHA-256 hashing core that exceeds 11Gbps (after place and route in Xilinx Virtex 6 board)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21804","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21804","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21805","fieldValue":" Current video coding standards, e.g. MPEG-4 H.264\/AVC, include Variable Block Size Motion Estimation, in this paper, this process is implemented by a reconfigurable architecture based on Signed Digit arithmetic. Bit serial computation is applied to reconfigure pixel precision. The reconfigurable architectural model is extremely simple to reconfigure. Pixel truncation is used to speed up computation saving up 23.5&percnt; of clock cycles for 4-bit precision. This design allows to process all motion vectors of a block in just one iteration. This system has been implemented in FPGA, and HDTVp results are presented.
