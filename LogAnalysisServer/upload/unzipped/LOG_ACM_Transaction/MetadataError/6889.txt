Yet, some processor architectures of choice for DSP and media applications, such as wide-issue VLIW processors, remain impractical: the multi-ported register file makes a very inefficient use of the resources in the FPGA fabric. This paper proposes modifications to existing FPGAs to make soft-VLIW processor viable. We introduce an embedded multi-ported RAM that can be customized to match the issue-width of VLIW processors. To ascertain the benefits of this approach, we map an extensible VLIW processor onto a standard FPGA from Xilinx. For the register file implemented in the modified FPGA, the area occupied is at least 102Ã\u2014 smaller and the dynamic power is reduced by 41&percnt; as compared to the implementation using configurable logic blocks in existing standard FPGAs. A subset of this embedded multi-ported RAM can also be used for mapping the register file in soft-RISC processors. For the soft-RISC processor, the register file in the modified FPGA is at least 22Ã\u2014 smaller than its equivalent that uses configurable logic blocks and 1.5Ã\u2014 the size in comparison to the implementation using block RAMs. Reduction of routing area and the maximum net length is about 39&percnt; and 51&percnt; respectively for RISC processors. As a result, this approach works towards enhancing soft-processor density in FPGAs by orders of magnitude."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1758","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1758","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8514","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8514","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8514","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8515","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
