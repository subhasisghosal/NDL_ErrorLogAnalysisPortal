The generation of real-time constraints will significantly expand the applicability of dynamically reconfigurable systems to new domains, such as digital video processing. We develop a dynamically reconfigurable 2D FIR filtering system that can meet real-time constraints in energy, performance, and accuracy (EPA). The real-time constraints are automatically generated based on user input, image types associated with video communications, and video content. We first generate a set of Pareto-optimal realizations, described by their EPA values and associated 2D FIR hardware description bitstreams. Dynamic management is then achieved by selecting Pareto-optimal realizations that meet the automatically generated time-varying EPA constraints. We validate our approach using three different 2D Gaussian filters. Filter realizations are evaluated in terms of the required energy per frame, accuracy of the resulting image, and performance in frames per second. We demonstrate dynamic EPA management by applying a Difference of Gaussians (DOG) filter to standard video sequences. For video frame sizes that are equal to or larger than the VGA resolution, compared to a static implementation, our dynamic system provides significant reduction in the total energy consumption (>30&percnt;)."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21873","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21873","fieldValue":"Dynamic Energy, Performance, and Accuracy Optimization and Management Using Automatically Generated Constraints for Separable 2D FIR Filtering for Digital Video Processing"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21873","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21873","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21874","fieldValue":" Timing Extraction identifies the delay of fine-grained components within an FPGA. From these computed delays, the delay of any path can be calculated. Moreover, a comparison of the fine-grained delays allows a detailed understanding of the amount and type of process variation that exists in the FPGA. To obtain these delays, Timing Extraction measures, using only resources already available in the FPGA, the delay of a small subset of the total paths in the FPGA. We apply Timing Extraction to the Logic Array Block (LAB) on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA to obtain a view of the delay down to near-individual LUT SRAM cell granularity, characterizing components with delays on the order of tens to a few hundred picoseconds with a resolution of ±3.2ps, matching the expected error bounds. This information reveals that the 65nm process used has, on average, random variation of σ μ =4.0&percnt; with components having an average maximum spread of 83ps. Timing Extraction also shows that as $V_DD decreases from 1.2V to 0.9V in a Cyclone IV 60nm FPGA, paths slow down, and variation increases from σ μ =4.3&percnt; to σ μ =5.8&percnt;, a clear indication that lowering VDD$ magnifies the impact of random variation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21874","fieldValue":"ACM"}
