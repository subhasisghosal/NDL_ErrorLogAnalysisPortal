{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25674","fieldValue":" It is a challenging work to design a robust color image watermarking scheme against geometric distortions. Moments and moment invariants have become a powerful tool in robust image watermarking owing to their image description capability and geometric invariance property. However, the existing moment-based watermarking schemes were mainly designed for gray images but not for color images, and detection quality and robustness will be lowered when watermark is directly embedded into the luminance component or three color channels of color images. Furthermore, the imperceptibility of the embedded watermark is not well guaranteed. Based on algebra of quaternions and polar harmonic transform (PHT), we introduced the quaternion polar harmonic transform (QPHT) for invariant color image watermarking in this article, which can be seen as the generalization of PHT for gray-level images. It is shown that the QPHT can be obtained from the PHT of each color channel. We derived and analyzed the rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) invariant property of QPHT. We also discussed the problem of color image watermarking using QPHT. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed color image watermarking against geometric distortions and common image processing operations (including color attacks)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25674","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25674","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25675","fieldValue":"Chen, Kuan-Ta"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25675","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25675","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25676","fieldValue":" To support the development of any system that includes the generation and evaluation of camcorder copies, as well as to provide a common benchmark for robustness against camcorder copies, we present a tool to simulate digital video re-acquisition using a digital video camera. By resampling each video frame, we simulate the typical artifacts occurring in a camcorder copy: geometric modifications (aspect ratio changes, cropping, perspective and lens distortion), temporal sampling artifacts (due to different frame rates, shutter speeds, rolling shutters, or playback), spatial and color subsampling (rescaling, filtering, Bayer color filter array), and processing steps (automatic gain control, automatic white balance). We also support the simulation of camera movement (e.g., a hand-held camera) and background insertion. Furthermore, we allow for an easy setup and calibration of all the simulated artifacts, using sample\/reference pairs of images and videos. Specifically temporal subsampling effects are analyzed in detail to create realistic frame blending artifacts in the simulated copies. We carefully evaluated our entire camcorder simulation system and found that the models we developed describe and match the real artifacts quite well."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/25676","fieldValue":"Moir&eacute;"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25676","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25676","fieldValue":"ACM"}
