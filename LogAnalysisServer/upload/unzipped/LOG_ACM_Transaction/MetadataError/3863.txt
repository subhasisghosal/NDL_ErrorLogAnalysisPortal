{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22400","fieldValue":" In the attempt to bring modern broadband Internet features to traditional broadcast television, the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) consortium introduced a specification called Hybrid Broadcast-Broadband Television (HbbTV), which allows broadcast streams to include embedded HTML content that is rendered by the television. This system is already in very wide deployment in Europe and has recently been adopted as part of the American digital television standard. Our analyses of the specifications, and of real systems implementing them, show that the broadband and broadcast systems are combined insecurely. This enables a large-scale exploitation technique with a localized geographical footprint based on Radio Frequency (RF) injection, which requires a minimal budget and infrastructure and is remarkably difficult to detect. In this article, we present the attack methodology and a number of follow-on exploitation techniques that provide significant flexibility to attackers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the technical complexity and required budget are low, making this attack practical and realistic, especially in areas with high population density: In a dense urban area, an attacker with a budget of about 450 can target more than 20,000 devices in a single attack. A unique aspect of this attack is that, in contrast to most Internet of Things\/Cyber-Physical System threat scenarios, where the attack comes from the data network side and affects the physical world, our attack uses the physical broadcast network to attack the data network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22401","fieldValue":" Passwords are ubiquitous in our daily digital lives. They protect various types of assets ranging from a simple account on an online newspaper website to our health information on government websites. However, due to the inherent value they protect, attackers have developed insights into cracking\/guessing passwords both offline and online. In many cases, users are forced to choose stronger passwords to comply with password policies; such policies are known to alienate users and do not significantly improve password quality. Another solution is to put in place proactive password-strength meters\/checkers to give feedback to users while they create new passwords. Millions of users are now exposed to these meters on highly popular web services that use user-chosen passwords for authentication. More recently, these meters are also being built into popular password managers, which protect several user secrets including passwords. Recent studies have found evidence that some meters actually guide users to choose better passwordsâ\u20AC\u201Dwhich is a rare bit of good news in password research. However, these meters are mostly based on ad hoc design. At least, as we found, most vendors do not provide any explanation for their design choices, sometimes making them appear as a black box. We analyze password meters deployed in selected popular websites and password managers. We document obfuscated source-available meters, infer the algorithm behind the closed-source ones, and measure the strength labels assigned to common passwords from several password dictionaries. From this empirical analysis with millions of passwords, we shed light on how the server end of some web service meters functions and provide examples of highly inconsistent strength outcomes for the same password in different meters, along with examples of many weak passwords being labeled as strong or even excellent. These weaknesses and inconsistencies may confuse users in choosing a stronger password, and thus may weaken the purpose of these meters. On the other hand, we believe these findings may help improve existing meters and possibly make them an effective tool in the long run."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22401","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22401","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1233","fieldValue":" Embryonic development of multicellular organisms, also known as morphogenesis, is regarded as a robust self-organization process for pattern generation. Inspired by the recent findings in biology indicating that morphogen gradients, together with a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN), play a key role in biological patterning, we propose a framework for self-organized multirobot pattern formation and boundary coverage based on an artificial GRN model. The proposed framework does not need a global coordinate system, which makes it more practical to be implemented in a physical robotic system. Moreover, an adaptation mechanism is included in the framework so that the self-organization algorithm is robust to changes in the number of robots. Various case studies of multirobot pattern formation and boundary coverage show the effectiveness of the framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/3139","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"October 2005\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3157\",\"title\":\"Issue 4, October 2005\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"April 2005\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3155\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, April 2005\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"January 2005\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3154\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, January 2005\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"July 05\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/3156\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, July 05\"}]"}
