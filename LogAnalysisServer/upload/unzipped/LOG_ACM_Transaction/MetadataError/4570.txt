There is therefore significant interest in procedures that efficiently select the best system, where best is defined by the maximum or minimum expected simulation output. In this paper, we examine both two-stage and sequential procedures that represent three structurally different modeling methodologies for allocating simulation replications to identify the best system, and we evaluate them empirically with respect to several measures of effectiveness. Empirical evidence suggests that sequential procedures perform better than their two-stage counterparts, including a heuristic sequential variation on Rinott's procedure. Further, there appears to be significant benefit to using procedures based on a Bayesian, average-case analysis as opposed to the statistically-conservative indifference-zone formulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24816","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24816","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24817","fieldValue":" The nature of the emerging field of web-based simulation is examined in terms of its relationship to the fundamental aspects of simulation research and practice. The presentation, assuming a form of debate, is based on a panel session held at the first International Conference on Web-Based Modeling and Simulation, which was sponsored by the Society for Computer Simulation during 11-14 January 1998 in San Diego, California. While no clear â\u20ACœwinnerâ\u20AC? is evident in this debate, the issues raised here certainly merit ongoing attention and contemplation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24817","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24817","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3399","fieldValue":" We present a method for image interpolation that is able to create high-quality, perceptually convincing transitions between recorded images. By implementing concepts derived from human vision, the problem of a physically correct image interpolation is relaxed to that of image interpolation which is perceived as visually correct by human observers. We find that it suffices to focus on exact edge correspondences, homogeneous regions and coherent motion to compute convincing results. A user study confirms the visual quality of the proposed image interpolation approach. We show how each aspect of our approach increases perceived quality of the result. We compare the results to other methods and assess achievable quality for different types of scenes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3399","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3399","fieldValue":"ACM"}
