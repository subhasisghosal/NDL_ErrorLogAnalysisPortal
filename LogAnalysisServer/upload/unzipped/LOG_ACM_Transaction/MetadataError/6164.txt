As real-time and embedded applications further advance, new timing constraint types are emerging as well. Recent research on interval-based timing constraints is an example. Thus, it is important to have a uniformed timing constraint representation so that a generalized approach can be developed to analyze the variant constraint types. A semiring-based timing constraint model is introduced to generalize the representations of different constraint types. Under this model, we develop an algorithm to check the satisfaction feasibility for a given set of semiring-based timing constraints. This algorithm provides better performance in the average case as compared to applying the Bellman-Ford algorithm directly on the constraint set. In addition, for a set of feasible semiring-based timing constraints, event occurrence points that satisfy the constraint set form a (hyperdimension) feasible region. For the given two sets of timing constraints, we develop a necessary and sufficient condition to testify whether the two constraint sets' feasible regions have an inclusion relation. If one feasible region is included in the other, we know that the real-time event occurrences that satisfy the included constraint set will necessarily satisfy the including set."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6449","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6449","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6450","fieldValue":"Tahaee, Seyed-Abdoreza"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6450","fieldValue":" This article takes a theoretical approach to focus on the algorithmic properties of hardware\/software partitioning. It proposes a method with polynomial complexity to find the global optimum of an NP-hard model partitioning problem for 75&percnt; of occurrences under some practical conditions. The global optimum is approached with a lower bound distance for the remaining 25&percnt;. Furthermore, this approach ensures finding the 2-approximate of the global optimum partition in 97&percnt; of instances where technical assumptions exist. The strategy is based on intelligently changing the parameters of the polynomial model of the partitioning problem to force it to produce (or approach) the exact solution to the NP-hard model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6450","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6450","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6451","fieldValue":"Peng, Huan-Kai"}
