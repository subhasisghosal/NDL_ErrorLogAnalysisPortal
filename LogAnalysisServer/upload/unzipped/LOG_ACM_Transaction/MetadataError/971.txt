This paper analyzes in a uniform way the performance of coalesced hashing and its variants, thus settling some open questions in the literature.In all the variants, the range of the hash function is called the address region, and extra space reserved for storing colliders is called the cellar. We refer to the unmodified method, which was analyzed previously, as late-insertion coalesced hashing. In this paper we analyze late insertion and two new variations called early insertion and varied insertion. When there is no cellar, the early-insertion method is better than late insertion; however, past experience has indicated that it might be worse when there is a cellar. Our analysis confirms that it is worse. The varied-insertion method was introduced as a means of combining the advantages of late insertion and early insertion. This paper shows that varied insertion requires fewer probes per search, on the average, than do the other variants.Each of these three coalesced hashing methods has a parameter that relates the sizes of the address region and the cellar. Techniques in this paper are designed for tuning the parameter in order to achieve optimum search times. We conclude with a list of open problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13982","fieldValue":"Deogun, J S."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13982","fieldValue":"Raghavan, V V."}
