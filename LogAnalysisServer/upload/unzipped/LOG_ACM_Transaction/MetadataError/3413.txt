{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3021","fieldValue":" Lack of labeled data is one of the severest problems facing word sense disambiguation (WSD). We overcome the problem by proposing a method that combines automatic labeled data expansion (Step 1) and semi-supervised learning (Step 2). The Step 1 and 2 methods are both effective, but their combination yields a synergistic effect. In this article, in Step 1, we automatically extract reliable labeled data from raw corpora using dictionary example sentences, even the infrequent and unseen senses (which are not likely to appear in labeled data). Next, in Step 2, we apply a semi-supervised classifier and achieve an improvement using easy-to-get unlabeled data. In this step, we also show that we can guess even unseen senses. We target a SemEval-2010 Japanese WSD task, which is a lexical sample task. Both Step 1 and Step 2 methods performed better than the best published result (76.4 &percnt;). Furthermore, the combined method achieved much higher accuracy (84.2 &percnt;). In this experiment, up to 50 &percnt; of unseen senses are classified correctly. However, the number of unseen senses are small, therefore, we delete one senses per word and apply our proposed method; the results show that the method is effective and robust even for unseen senses."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3021","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3021","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21201","fieldValue":" We describe LEAP&plus; (Localized Encryption and Authentication Protocol), a key management protocol for sensor networks that is designed to support in-network processing, while at the same time restricting the security impact of a node compromise to the immediate network neighborhood of the compromised node. The design of the protocol is motivated by the observation that different types of messages exchanged between sensor nodes have different security requirements, and that a single keying mechanism is not suitable for meeting these different security requirements. LEAP&plus; supports the establishment of four types of keys for each sensor node: an individual key shared with the base station, a pairwise key shared with another sensor node, a cluster key shared with multiple neighboring nodes, and a global key shared by all the nodes in the network. LEAP&plus; also supports (weak) local source authentication without precluding in-network processing. Our performance analysis shows that LEAP&plus; is very efficient in terms of computational, communication, and storage costs. We analyze the security of LEAP&plus; under various attack models and show that LEAP&plus; is very effective in defending against many sophisticated attacks, such as HELLO flood attacks, node cloning attacks, and wormhole attacks. A prototype implementation of LEAP&plus; on a sensor network testbed is also described."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21202","fieldValue":" We present a statistical method that uses prediction modeling to decrease the temporally redundant data transmitted back to the sink.

Third, a data transformation is proposed to bring the sensor sample series closer to weak stationarity. Finally, an efficient implementation is presented.

LCR assigns each node a logical coordinate vector, and routes packets following these vectors. We demonstrate that LCR (i) guarantees packet delivery with a high probability, (ii) finds good paths, and (iii) exhibits robust performance in the presence of network voids and node failures. We systematically evaluate the performance of LCR through simulations and compare it with other state-of-the-art protocols. We also propose two extensions of LCR, one for three-dimensional node deployments and the other for unreliable wireless links."}
