However, the correct and efficient biological interpretation of such voluminous data remains a challenging problem. Many tools have been developed for the analysis of GO terms that are over- or under-represented in a list of differentially expressed genes. However, a previously unexplored aspect is the identification of changes in the way various biological processes interact in a given condition with respect to a reference. Here, we present a novel approach that aims at identifying such interactions between biological processes that are significantly different in a given phenotype with respect to normal. The proposed technique uses vector-space representation, SVD-based dimensionality reduction, differential weighting, and bootstrapping to asses the significance of the interactions under the multiple and complex dependencies expected between the biological processes. We illustrate our approach on two real data sets involving breast and lung cancer. More than 88 percent of the interactions found by our approach were deemed to be correct by an extensive manual review of literature. An interesting subset of such interactions is discussed in detail and shown to have the potential to open new avenues for research in lung and breast cancer."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4822","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4822","fieldValue":"Phenotype-specific interactions, biological processes, microarrays, gene ontology, single value decomposition."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4822","fieldValue":"Detecting Phenotype-Specific Interactions between Biological Processes from Microarray Data and Annotations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4822","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4822","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4823","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study the problem of finding a periodic attractor of a Boolean network (BN), which arises in computational systems biology and is known to be NP-hard. Since a general case is quite hard to solve, we consider special but biologically important subclasses of BNs. For finding an attractor of period 2 of a BN consisting of n OR functions of positive literals, we present a polynomial time algorithm. For finding an attractor of period 2 of a BN consisting of n AND\/OR functions of literals, we present an O(1.985^n) time algorithm. For finding an attractor of a fixed period of a BN consisting of n nested canalyzing functions and having constant treewidth w, we present an O(n^{2p(w+1)} poly(n)) time algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4823","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4823","fieldValue":"ACM"}
