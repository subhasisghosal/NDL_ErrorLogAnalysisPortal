In the traditional supervised passive approach, the system is trained on a given number of annotated data samples and evaluated using a separate test set. Then more data is collected arbitrarily, annotated, and the whole cycle is repeated. In this article, we propose the active approach where the system itself selects its own training data, evaluates itself and re-trains when necessary. We first employ active learning which aims to automatically select the examples that are likely to be the most informative for a given task. We use active learning for both selecting the examples to label and the examples to re-label in order to correct labeling errors. Furthermore, the system automatically evaluates itself using active evaluation to keep track of the unexpected events and decides on-demand to label more examples. The active approach enables dynamic adaptation of spoken language processing systems to unseen or unexpected events for nonstationary input while reducing the manual annotation effort significantly. We have evaluated the active approach with the AT&T spoken dialog system used for customer care applications. In this article, we present our results for both automatic speech recognition and spoken language understanding."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23028","fieldValue":" Confidence measures are a practical solution for improving the usefulness of Natural Language Processing applications.
