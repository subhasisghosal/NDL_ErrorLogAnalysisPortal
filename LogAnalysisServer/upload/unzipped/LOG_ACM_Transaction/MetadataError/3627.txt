Novel methods for rapid virtual prototyping, performance prediction, and evaluation are of critical importance in the engineering of complex reconfigurable systems and applications. These techniques can yield insightful tradeoff analyses while saving valuable time and resources for researchers and engineers alike. The research described herein provides a methodology for mapping arbitrary applications to targeted reconfigurable platforms in a simulation environment called RCSE. By splitting the process into two domains, the application and simulation domains, characterization of each element can occur independently and in parallel, leading to fast and accurate performance prediction results for large and complex systems. This article presents the design of a novel framework for system-level simulative performance prediction of RC systems and applications. The article also presents a set of case studies analyzing two applications, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and Molecular Dynamics (MD), across three disparate RC platforms within the simulation framework. The validation results using each of these applications and systems show that our framework can quickly obtain performance prediction results with reasonable accuracy on a variety of platforms. Finally, a set of simulative case studies are presented to illustrate the various capabilities of the framework to quickly obtain a wide range of performance prediction results and power consumption estimates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21761","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21761","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21762","fieldValue":" Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation is a special Monte Carlo simulation method that uses quasi-random or low-discrepancy numbers as random sample sets. In many applications, this method has proved advantageous compared to the traditional Monte Carlo simulation method, which uses pseudo-random numbers, thanks to its faster convergence and higher level of accuracy. This article presents the design and implementation of a massively parallelized Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation engine on an FPGA-based supercomputer, called Maxwell. It also compares this implementation with equivalent graphics processing units (GPUs) and general purpose processors (GPP)-based implementations. The detailed comparison between these three implementations (FPGA vs. GPP vs. GPU) is done in the context of financial derivatives pricing based on our Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation engine. Real hardware implementations on the Maxwell machine show that FPGAs outperform equivalent GPP-based software implementations by 2 orders of magnitude, with the speed-up figure scaling linearly with the number of processing nodes used (FPGAs\/GPPs). The same implementations show that FPGAs achieve a ~ 3x speedup compared to equivalent GPU-based implementations. Power consumption measurements also show FPGAs to be 336x more energy efficient than CPUs, and 16x more energy efficient than GPUs."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21762","fieldValue":"CPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21762","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21762","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21762","fieldValue":"ACM"}
