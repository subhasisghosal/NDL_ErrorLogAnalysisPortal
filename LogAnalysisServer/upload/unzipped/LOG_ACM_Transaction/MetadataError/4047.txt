The presented approach is language neutral, due to its statistical nature, and appears to hold a level of evaluation performance that matches and even exceeds other contemporary evaluation methods. Within this study, we measure the effectiveness of different representation methods, namely, word and character n-gram graph and histogram, different n-gram neighborhood indication methods as well as different comparison methods between the supplied representations. A theory for the a priori determination of the methods' parameters along with supporting experiments concludes the study to provide a complete alternative to existing methods concerning the automatic summary system evaluation process."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23042","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23042","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23043","fieldValue":" Referential coherence represents the smoothness of discourse resulting from topic continuity and pronominalization. Rational individuals prefer a referentially coherent structure of discourse when they select a language expression and its interpretation. This is a preference for cooperation in communication. By what principle do they share coherent expressions and interpretations&quest; Centering theory is the standard theory of referential coherence [Grosz et al. 1995]. Although it is well designed on the bases of first-order inference rules [Joshi and Kuhn 1979], it does not embody a behavioral principle for the cooperation evident in communication. Hasida [1996] proposed a game-theoretic hypothesis in relation to this issue. We aim to empirically verify Hasida's hypothesis by using corpora of multiple languages. We statistically design language-dependent parameters by using a corpus of the target language. This statistical design enables us to objectively absorb language-specific differences and to verify the universality of Hasida's hypothesis by using corpora. We empirically verified our model by using large Japanese and English corpora. The result proves the language universality of the hypothesis."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23043","fieldValue":"A game-theoretic model of referential coherence and its empirical verification using large Japanese and English corpora"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23044","fieldValue":" We propose a text-categorization bootstrapping algorithm in which categories are described by relevant seed words. Our method introduces two unsupervised techniques to improve the initial categorization step of the bootstrapping scheme: (i) using latent semantic spaces to estimate the similarity among documents and words, and (ii) the Gaussian mixture algorithm, which differentiates relevant and nonrelevant category information using statistics from unlabeled examples. In particular, this second step maps the similarity scores to class posterior probabilities, and therefore reduces sensitivity to keyword-dependent variations in scores. The algorithm was evaluated on two text categorization tasks, and obtained good performance using only the category names as initial seeds. In particular, the performance of the proposed method proved to be equivalent to a pure supervised approach trained on 70--160 labeled documents per category."}
