The dynamic text and static pattern matching problem is the problem of finding a static pattern in a text that is continuously being updated. The goal is to report all new occurrences of the pattern in the text after each text update. We present an algorithm for solving the problem where the text update operation is changing the symbol value of a text location. Given a text of length n and a pattern of length m, our algorithm preprocesses the text in time O(n log log m), and the pattern in time O(m log m). The extra space used is O(n &plus; m log m). Following each text update, the algorithm deletes all prior occurrences of the pattern that no longer match, and reports all new occurrences of the pattern in the text in O(log log m) time. We note that the complexity is not proportional to the number of pattern occurrences, since all new occurrences can be reported in a succinct form."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2260","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2260","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13222","fieldValue":" Functional verification of modern digital designs is a crucial, time-consuming task impacting not only the correctness of the final product, but also its time to market. At the heart of most of todayâ\u20AC™s verification efforts is logic simulation, used heavily to verify the functional correctness of a design for a broad range of abstraction levels. In mainstream industry verification methodologies, typical setups coordinate the validation effort of a complex digital system by distributing logic simulation tasks among vast server farms for months at a time. Yet, the performance of logic simulation is not sufficient to satisfy the demand, leading to incomplete validation processes, escaped functional bugs, and continuous pressure on the EDA industry to develop faster simulation solutions. In this work we propose GCS, a solution to boost the performance of logic simulation, gate-level simulation in particular, by more than a factor of 10 using recent hardware advances in Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) technology. Noting the vast available parallelism in the hardware of modern GPUs and the inherently parallel structures of gate-level netlists, we propose novel algorithms for the efficient mapping of complex designs to parallel hardware. Our novel simulation architecture maximizes the utilization of concurrent hardware resources while minimizing expensive communication overhead. The experimental results show that our GPU-based simulator is capable of handling the validation of industrial-size designs while delivering more than an order-of-magnitude performance improvements on average, over the fastest multithreaded simulators commercially available."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13222","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13222","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13223","fieldValue":" Power dissipation has become a critical design constraint for the growth of modern multicore systems due to increasing clock frequencies, leakage currents, and system parasitics. To overcome this urgent crisis, this article presents an embedded platform for on-chip power management of a multicore System-on-Chip (SoC). The design involves the development of two key components, from the hardware to the software level. From the hardware perspective, a multiple-supply power management unit is proposed and is implemented using a Single-Inductor Multiple-Output (SIMO) DC-DC converter. To dynamically respond to the sensed instantaneous power demands and to accurately control the power delivery to the processor cores, the power management unit employs a software-defined adaptive global\/local power allocation feedback controller. The proposed controller is designed using the hardware-software codesign methodology to uniquely control the SIMO converter during various operation scenarios. This is achieved using several embedded software control algorithms that operate synergetically to ensure efficient and reliable system operation. The hardware-software codesign technique also allows the SIMO controller to be integrated with future microprocessor cores. Therefore, by employing the vast amount of on-chip resources, the converter can perform effective power processing to provide the most power-optimal voltages at the hardware level. Such an embedded power management module leads to an integrated, power-aware, and autonomous SoC design that is independent of additional external hardware control, thereby reducing on-chip area and system complexity. In this design, each power output from the SIMO converter provides a step-up\/down voltage conversion, thereby enabling a wide range of variable supply voltage. An adaptive global\/local power allocation control algorithm is employed to significantly improve Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) tracking speed and line\/load regulation, while still retaining low cross-regulation. Designed with a 180nm CMOS process, the converter precisely provides three independently variable power outputs from 0.9 V to 3.0 V, with a total power range from 33 mW to 900 mW. A very fast load transient response of 3.25 Î¼s is achieved, in response to a 67.5-mA full-step load current change. The design thus provides a cost-effective power management solution to achieve a robust, fast-transient, DVFS-compatible multicore SoC."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13223","fieldValue":"Hardware-Software Codesign of an Embedded Multiple-Supply Power Management Unit for Multicore SoCs Using an Adaptive Global\/Local Power Allocation and Processing Scheme"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13223","fieldValue":"ACM"}
