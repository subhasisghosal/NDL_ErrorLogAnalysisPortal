The obtained results demonstrate that, with a large set of evaluation data, it is possible to train fully automatic evaluation systems based on visual features automatically extracted from the summaries. The proposed approach will enable faster and easier estimation of the results of newly developed abstraction algorithms and the study of which summary characteristics influence their perceived quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25451","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25451","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25452","fieldValue":" Visual reranking is effective to improve the performance of the text-based video search. However, existing reranking algorithms can only achieve limited improvement because of the well-known semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts. In this article, we adopt interactive video search reranking to bridge the semantic gap by introducing user's labeling effort. We propose a novel dimension reduction tool, termed sparse transfer learning (STL), to effectively and efficiently encode user's labeling information. STL is particularly designed for interactive video search reranking. Technically, it (a) considers the pair-wise discriminative information to maximally separate labeled query relevant samples from labeled query irrelevant ones, (b) achieves a sparse representation for the subspace to encodes user's intention by applying the elastic net penalty, and (c) propagates user's labeling information from labeled samples to unlabeled samples by using the data distribution knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on the TRECVID 2005, 2006 and 2007 benchmark datasets and compared STL with popular dimension reduction algorithms. We report superior performance by using the proposed STL-based interactive video search reranking."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25453","fieldValue":" Various Information Management techniques have been developed to help maintain a consistent shared virtual world in a Networked Virtual Environment. However, such techniques have to be carefully adapted to the application state dynamics and the underlying network. This work presents a novel framework that minimizes inconsistency by optimizing bandwidth usage to deliver useful information. This framework measures the state evolution using an information model and dynamically switches extrapolation models and the packet rate to make the most information-efficient usage of the available bandwidth. The results shown demonstrate that this approach can help optimize consistency under constrained and time-varying network conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25453","fieldValue":"ACM"}
