It turns out that this property makes patterns of geodesics the basic geometric entity when dealing with the cladding of a freeform surface with wooden panels which do not bend sideways. Likewise a geodesic is the favored shape of timber support elements in freeform architecture, for reasons of manufacturing and statics. Both problem areas are fundamental in freeform architecture, but so far only experimental solutions have been available. This paper provides a systematic treatment and shows how to design geodesic patterns in different ways: The evolution of geodesic curves is good for local studies and simple patterns; the level set formulation can deal with the global layout of multiple patterns of geodesics; finally geodesic vector fields allow us to interactively model geodesic patterns and perform surface segmentation into panelizable parts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16250","fieldValue":"Fu, Chi-Wing"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16250","fieldValue":"Lai, Chi-Fu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16250","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16250","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a method for optimizing the tiles of a quad-mesh. Given a quad-based surface, the goal is to generate a set of K quads whose instances can produce a tiled surface that approximates the input surface. A solution to the problem is a K-set tilable surface, which can lead to an effective cost reduction in the physical construction of the given surface. Rather than molding lots of different building blocks, a K-set tilable surface requires the construction of K prefabricated components only. To realize the K-set tilable surface, we use a cluster-optimize approach. First, we iteratively cluster and analyze: clusters of similar shapes are merged, while edge connections between the K quads on the target surface are analyzed to learn the induced flexibility of the K-set tilable surface. Then, we apply a non-linear optimization model with constraints that maintain the K quads connections and shapes, and show how quad-based surfaces are optimized into K-set tilable surfaces. Our algorithm is demonstrated on various surfaces, including some that mimic the exteriors of certain renowned building landmarks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16250","fieldValue":"ACM"}
