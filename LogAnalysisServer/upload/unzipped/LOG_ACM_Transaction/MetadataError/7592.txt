However, existing approaches can either not guarantee delivery or they require the exchange of complete neighborhood information. We describe two general methods for completely reactive face routing with guaranteed delivery. The Beaconless Forwarder Planarization (BFP) scheme determines correct edges of a local planar subgraph without hearing from all neighbors. Face routing then continues properly. Angular Relaying determines directly the next hop of a face traversal. Both schemes are based on the Select-and-Protest principle. Neighbors respond according to a delay function, but only if they do not violate a planar subgraph condition. Protest messages are used to remove falsely selected neighbors that are not in the planar subgraph. We show that a correct beaconless planar subgraph construction is not possible without protests. We also show the impact of the chosen planar subgraph on the message complexity. With the new Circlunar Neighborhood Graph (CNG) we can bound the worst case message complexity of BFP, which is not possible when using the Gabriel graph (GG) for planarization. Simulation results show similar message complexities in the average case when using CNG and GG. Angular Relaying uses a delay function that is based on the angular distance to the previous hop. We develop a theoretical framework for delay functions and show both theoretically and in simulations that with a function of angle and distance we can reduce the number of protests by a factor of 2 compared to a simple angle-based delay function."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9994","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9994","fieldValue":"Message-efficient beaconless georouting with guaranteed delivery in wireless sensor, ad hoc, and actuator networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9994","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9995","fieldValue":" Despite significant efforts to obtain an accurate picture of the Internet's connectivity structure at the level of individual autonomous systems (ASes), much has remained unknown in terms of the quality of the inferred AS maps that have been widely used by the research community. In this paper, we assess the quality of the inferred Internet maps through case studies of a sample set of ASes. These case studies allow us to establish the ground truth of connectivity between this set of ASes and their directly connected neighbors. A direct comparison between the ground truth and inferred topology maps yield insights into questions such as which parts of the actual topology are adequately captured by the inferred maps, which parts are missing and why, and what is the percentage of missing links in these parts. This information is critical in assessing, for each class of real-world networking problems, whether the use of currently inferred AS maps or proposed AS topology models is, or is not, appropriate. More importantly, our newly gained insights also point to new directions towards building realistic and economically viable Internet topology maps."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9995","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9995","fieldValue":"ACM"}
