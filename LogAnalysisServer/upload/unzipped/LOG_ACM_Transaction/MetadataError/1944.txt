In this article, we propose a high-quality image deblurring method with a novel image prior based on a new imaging system. The imaging system has a newly designed sensor pattern achieved by adding panchromatic (pan) pixels to the conventional Bayer pattern. Since these pan pixels are sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light, they collect a significantly higher proportion of the light striking the sensor. A new demosaicing algorithm is also proposed to restore full-resolution images from pixels on the sensor. The shutter speed of pan pixels is controllable to users. Therefore, we can produce multiple images with different exposures. When long exposure is needed under dim light, we read pan pixels twice in one shot: one with short exposure and the other with long exposure. The long-exposure image is often blurred, while the short-exposure image can be sharp and noisy. The short-exposure image plays an important role in deblurring, since it is sharp and there is no alignment problem for the one-shot image pair. For the algorithmic aspect, our method runs in a two-step maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) fashion under a joint minimization of the blur kernel and the deblurred image. The algorithm exploits a combined image prior with a statistical part and a spatial part, which is powerful in ringing controls. Extensive experiments under various conditions and settings are conducted to demonstrate the performance of our method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16709","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16709","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16710","fieldValue":" Soft shadows from area lights are one of the most crucial effects in high-quality and production rendering, but Monte-Carlo sampling of visibility is often the main source of noise in rendered images. Indeed, it is common to use deterministic uniform sampling for the smoother shading effects in direct lighting, so that all of the Monte Carlo noise arises from visibility sampling alone. In this article, we analyze theoretically and empirically, using both statistical and Fourier methods, the effectiveness of different nonadaptive Monte Carlo sampling patterns for rendering soft shadows. We start with a single image scanline and a linear light source, and gradually consider more complex visibility functions at a pixel. We show analytically that the lowest expected variance is in fact achieved by uniform sampling (albeit at the cost of visual banding artifacts). Surprisingly, we show that for two or more discontinuities in the visibility function, a comparable error to uniform sampling is obtained by â\u20ACœuniform jitterâ\u20AC? sampling, where a constant jitter is applied to all samples in a uniform pattern (as opposed to jittering each stratum as in standard stratified sampling). The variance can be reduced by up to a factor of two, compared to stratified or quasi-Monte Carlo techniques, without the banding in uniform sampling. We augment our statistical analysis with a novel 2D Fourier analysis across the pixel-light space. This allows us to characterize the banding frequencies in uniform sampling, and gives insights into the behavior of uniform jitter and stratified sampling. We next extend these results to planar area light sources. We show that the best sampling method can vary, depending on the type of light source (circular, Gaussian, or square\/rectangular). The correlation of adjacent â\u20ACœlight scanlinesâ\u20AC? in square light sources can reduce the effectiveness of uniform jitter sampling, while the smoother shape of circular and Gaussian-modulated sources preserves its benefitsâ\u20AC\u201Dthese findings are also exposed through our frequency analysis. In practical terms, the theory in this article provides guidelines for selecting visibility sampling strategies, which can reduce the number of shadow samples by 20--40&percnt;, with simple modifications to existing rendering code."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16711","fieldValue":" We present a novel method of simulating wave effects in graphics using ray-based renderers with a new function: the Wave BSDF (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function). Reflections from neighboring surface patches represented by local BSDFs are mutually independent. However, in many surfaces with wavelength-scale microstructures, interference and diffraction requires a joint analysis of reflected wavefronts from neighboring patches. We demonstrate a simple method to compute the BSDF for the entire microstructure, which can be used independently for each patch. This allows us to use traditional ray-based rendering pipelines to synthesize wave effects. We exploit the Wigner Distribution Function (WDF) to create transmissive, reflective, and emissive BSDFs for various diffraction phenomena in a physically accurate way. In contrast to previous methods for computing interference, we circumvent the need to explicitly keep track of the phase of the wave by using BSDFs that include positive as well as negative coefficients. We describe and compare the theory in relation to well-understood concepts in rendering and demonstrate a straightforward implementation. In conjunction with standard raytracers, such as PBRT, we demonstrate wave effects for a range of scenarios such as multibounce diffraction materials, holograms, and reflection of high-frequency surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16711","fieldValue":"ACM"}
