Particularly we examine haptic-to-video and haptic-to-audio skew. For this purpose we have designed an experimental setup, where users are exposed to a basic multimedia presentation resembling a ping-pong game. For every collision between a ball and a racket, the user is able to perceive auditory, visual, and haptic cues about the collision event. We artificially introduce negative and positive delay to the auditory and visual cues with respect to the haptic stream. We subjectively evaluate the perception of inter-stream asynchrony perceived by the users using two types of haptic devices. The statistical results of our evaluation show perception rates of around 100 ms regardless of modality and type of device."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/25491","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2457450.2457451\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25492","fieldValue":" Despite the fact that performance improvements have been reported in the last years, semantic concept detection in video remains a challenging problem. Existing concept detection techniques, with ontology rules, exploit the static correlations among primitive concepts but not the dynamic spatiotemporal correlations. The proposed method rewards (or punishes) detected primitive concepts using dynamic spatiotemporal correlations of the given ontology rules and updates these ontology rules based on the accuracy of detection. Adaptively learned ontology rules significantly help in improving the overall accuracy of concept detection as shown in the experimental result."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/25492","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2457450.2457452\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25493","fieldValue":"El Saddik, Abdulmotaleb"}
