{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3691","fieldValue":" This paper presents a patchwork-based audio watermarking method to resist de-synchronization attacks such as pitch-scaling, time-scaling, and jitter attacks. At the embedding stage, the watermarks are embedded into the host audio signal in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. Then, a set of synchronization bits are implanted into the watermarked signal in the logarithmic DCT (LDCT) domain. At the decoding stage, we analyze the received audio signal in the LDCT domain to find the scaling factor imposed by an attack. Then, we modify the received signal to remove the scaling effect, together with the embedded synchronization bits. After that, watermarks are extracted from the modified signal. Simulation results show that at the embedding rate of 10 bps, the proposed method achieves 98.9% detection rate on average under the considered de-synchronization attacks. At the embedding rate of 16 bps, it can still obtain 94.7% detection rate on average. So, the proposed method is much more robust to de-synchronization attacks than other patchwork watermarking methods. Compared with the audio watermarking methods designed for tackling de-synchronization attacks, our method has much higher embedding capacity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3691","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3691","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3692","fieldValue":"McLoughlin, Ian Vince"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3692","fieldValue":" In this paper, reflected sound of frequency just above the audible range is used to detect speech activity. The active signal used is inaudible to humans, readily generated by the typical audio circuitry and components found in mobile telephones, and is robust to background sounds such as nearby voices. In use, the system relies upon a wideband excitation signal emitted from a loudspeaker located near the lips, which reflects from the mouth region and is then captured by a nearby microphone. The state of the lip opening is evaluated periodically by tracking the resonance patterns in the reflected excitation signal. When the lips are open, deep and complex resonances are formed as energy propagates into and then reflects out from the open mouth and vocal tract, with resonance depth being related to the open lip area. When the lips are closed, these resonance patterns are absent. The presence of the resonances can thus serve as a low complexity detection measure. The technique is evaluated for multiple users in terms of sensitivity to source placement and sensor placement. Voice activity detection performance using this measure is further evaluated in the presence of realistic wideband acoustic background noise, as well as artificially added noise. The system is shown to be relatively insensitive to sensor placement, highly insensitive to background noise, and able to achieve greater than 90% voice activity detection accuracy. The technique is even suitable when a subject is whispering in the presence of much louder multi-speaker babble. The technique has potential for speech-based systems operating in high noise environments as well as in silent speech interfaces, whisper-input systems and voice prostheses for speech-impaired users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3692","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3692","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1279","fieldValue":" Self-protecting software systems are a class of autonomic systems capable of detecting and mitigating security threats at runtime. They are growing in importance, as the stovepipe static methods of securing software systems have been shown to be inadequate for the challenges posed by modern software systems. Self-protection, like other self-* properties, allows the system to adapt to the changing environment through autonomic means without much human intervention, and can thereby be responsive, agile, and cost effective. While existing research has made significant progress towards autonomic and adaptive security, gaps and challenges remain. This article presents a significant extension of our preliminary study in this area. In particular, unlike our preliminary study, here we have followed a systematic literature review process, which has broadened the scope of our study and strengthened the validity of our conclusions. By proposing and applying a comprehensive taxonomy to classify and characterize the state-of-the-art research in this area, we have identified key patterns, trends and challenges in the existing approaches, which reveals a number of opportunities that will shape the focus of future research efforts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1279","fieldValue":"ACM"}
