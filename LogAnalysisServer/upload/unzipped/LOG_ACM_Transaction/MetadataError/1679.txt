Our approach is based on an equivalent dipole method and as such it is discrete from the ground up. Our approach is symmetric as we base both field and force computations on dipole interactions. Enriching rigid body simulation with magnetism allows for many new and interesting possibilities in computer animation and special effects. Our method also allows the accurate computation of magnetic fields for arbitrarily shaped objects, which is especially interesting for pedagogy as it allows the user to visually discover properties of magnetism which would otherwise be difficult to grasp. We demonstrate our method on a variety of problems and our results reflect intuitive as well as surprising effects. Our method is fast and can be coupled with any rigid body solver to simulate dozens of magnetic objects at interactive rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16031","fieldValue":" Recent advances have brought real-time physically based simulation within reach, but simulations are still difficult to control in real time. We present interactive simulations of passive systems such as deformable solids or fluids that are not only fast, but also directable: they follow given input trajectories while simultaneously reacting to user input and other unexpected disturbances. We achieve such directability using a real-time controller that runs in tandem with a real-time physically based simulation. To avoid stiff and over-controlled systems where the natural dynamics are overpowered, the injection of control forces has to be minimized. This search for gentle forces can be made tractable in real-time by linearizing the system dynamics around the input trajectory, and then using a time-varying linear quadratic regulator to build the controller. We show examples of controlled complex deformable solids and fluids, demonstrating that our approach generates a requested fixed outcome for reasonable user inputs, while simultaneously providing runtime motion variety."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16031","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16031","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16032","fieldValue":" We present a new discrete velocity-level formulation of frictional contact dynamics that reduces to a pair of coupled projections and introduce a simple fixed-point property of this coupled system. This allows us to construct a novel algorithm for accurate frictional contact resolution based on a simple staggered sequence of projections. The algorithm accelerates performance using warm starts to leverage the potentially high temporal coherence between contact states and provides users with direct control over frictional accuracy. Applying this algorithm to rigid and deformable systems, we obtain robust and accurate simulations of frictional contact behavior not previously possible, at rates suitable for interactive haptic simulations, as well as large-scale animations. By construction, the proposed algorithm guarantees exact, velocity-level contact constraint enforcement and obtains long-term stable and robust integration. Examples are given to illustrate the performance, plausibility and accuracy of the obtained solutions."}
