{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13146","fieldValue":" With CMOS process technology scaling to deep submicron level, propagation delay across long on-chip buses is becoming one of the main performance limiting factors in high-performance designs. Propagation delay is very significant when adjacent wires are transitioning in opposite direction as compared to transitioning in the same direction. As opposite transitions on adjacent wires (called as crosstalk transitions) have significant impact on propagation delay, several bus encoding techniques have been proposed in literature to eliminate such transitions. We propose selective shielding technique to eliminate crosstalk transitions. We show that the selective shielding technique requires ‚åà3n\/2‚å\u2030 wires to encode a n-bit bus. SPICE simulations by considering 90nm technology nodes reveal that, for uniformly distributed random data, our technique achieves nearly 39&percnt; (21&percnt;) delay savings over 10mm-length uncoded 32-bit bus for pipelined (nonpipelined) data transmission at the cost of nearly 7&percnt; energy overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13146","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13146","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13147","fieldValue":" Increasing demands on computing power have spurred the development of faster, higher-density Integrated Circuits (ICs), compounding power and complexity concerns in design budgets. The clock distribution network is a significant contributor to such power and complexity concerns. Resonant rotary clocking is a relatively new technology that realizes several benefits over current clocking methods, including power, frequency, and variation tolerance, yet lacks the automation tools to promote increased use. Towards this end, an automated rotary clock routing methodology is presented that generates custom topology rotary ring routes with tree subnetworks. In addition to the benefits of adiabatic clocking, the presented custom topology router permits 38.6&percnt; shorter wirelengths on average for register tapping, compared to traditional prescribed skew, binary tree routing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13147","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13147","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13148","fieldValue":"Liu, Chih-Hung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13148","fieldValue":"Yuan, Shih-Yi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13148","fieldValue":"Kuo, Sy-Yen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13148","fieldValue":"Wang, Szu-Chi"}
