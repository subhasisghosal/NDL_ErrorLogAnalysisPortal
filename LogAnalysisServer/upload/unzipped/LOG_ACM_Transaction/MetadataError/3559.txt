The wireless fingerprinting method implemented on the USRP1 device exploits differences in the phase attributes of demodulated data samples. The method does not require the use of expensive spectrum analyzer equipment and the associated high sampling and processing rates with such equipment. Instead, data sample inputs are used, sampled at a rate of 4MHz. This makes implementation using real Wireless Sensor Network nodes feasible and allows wireless fingerprints to be gathered inside each node in a network. This is important since wireless fingerprints degrade over distance, making distributed implementations more attractive. With our method, the USRP1 classifies accurately over a wide range of network conditions, including time and transmission distance. Performance is also stable for different receiving devices. We achieve average classification accuracies of 99.6&percnt; at short range, 95.3&percnt; at medium range, and 81.9&percnt; at long range when classifying a limited sample of five devices from the same manufacturer."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21569","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21569","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21570","fieldValue":"Hsieh, Hung-Yun"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21570","fieldValue":"Chang, Chih-Hua"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21570","fieldValue":"Liao, Wei-Chih"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21570","fieldValue":" Many applications involving machine-to-machine (M2M) communications are characterized by the large amount of data to transport. To support these M2M applications, we argue in this article that instead of focusing on serving individual machines with better quality, one should focus on solutions that can better serve the data itself. To substantiate, we consider the application of data gathering from a set of machines that communicate directly to an aggregator. Since the aggregator has limited radio resources, the problem arises as to how the resource can be effectively utilized for supporting such an application. We investigate â\u20ACœdata-centricâ\u20AC? resource allocation that aims to maximize information entropy of data collected through selecting the subset of machines to transmit, determining the amount of resources to allocate, and scheduling the sequence of transmissions. We present two instantiations of the problems when machines can perform distributed source coding or dependent source coding based on the data overheard from neighboring machines and then propose algorithms for solving the joint optimization problems. Evaluation results show that compared to conventional â\u20ACœmachine-centricâ\u20AC? resource allocation that aims to maximize the aggregate data rates or number of supported machines, â\u20ACœdata-centricâ\u20AC? resource allocation exhibits significant performance gain in terms of the quality of data that can be collected for the given amount of radio resources."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21570","fieldValue":"Not Every Bit Counts: Data-Centric Resource Allocation for Correlated Data Gathering in Machine-to-Machine Wireless Networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21570","fieldValue":"ACM"}
