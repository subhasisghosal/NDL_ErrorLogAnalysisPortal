{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16399","fieldValue":" The computer vision and pattern recognition communities have recently witnessed a surge of feature-based methods in object recognition and image retrieval applications. These methods allow representing images as collections of â\u20ACœvisual wordsâ\u20AC? and treat them using text search approaches following the â\u20ACœbag of featuresâ\u20AC? paradigm. In this article, we explore analogous approaches in the 3D world applied to the problem of nonrigid shape retrieval in large databases. Using multiscale diffusion heat kernels as â\u20ACœgeometric words,â\u20AC? we construct compact and informative shape descriptors by means of the â\u20ACœbag of featuresâ\u20AC? approach. We also show that considering pairs of â\u20ACœgeometric wordsâ\u20AC? (â\u20ACœgeometric expressionsâ\u20AC?) allows creating spatially sensitive bags of features with better discriminative power. Finally, adopting metric learning approaches, we show that shapes can be efficiently represented as binary codes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the SHREC 2010 large-scale shape retrieval benchmark."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16399","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16399","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16400","fieldValue":"Yeung, Sai-Kit"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16400","fieldValue":"Tang, Chi-Keung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16400","fieldValue":" This article introduces a new approach for matting and compositing transparent and refractive objects in photographs. The key to our work is an image-based matting model, termed the Attenuation-Refraction Matte (ARM), that encodes plausible refractive properties of a transparent object along with its observed specularities and transmissive properties. We show that an object's ARM can be extracted directly from a photograph using simple user markup. Once extracted, the ARM is used to paste the object onto a new background with a variety of effects, including compound compositing, Fresnel effect, scene depth, and even caustic shadows. User studies find our results favorable to those obtained with Photoshop as well as perceptually valid in most cases. Our approach allows photo editing of transparent and refractive objects in a manner that produces realistic effects previously only possible via 3D models or environment matting."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16401","fieldValue":" The exact Minkowski sum of polyhedra is of particular interest in many applications, ranging from image analysis and processing to computer-aided design and robotics. Its computation and implementation is a difficult and complicated task when nonconvex polyhedra are involved. We present the NCC-CVMS algorithm, an exact and efficient contributing vertices-based Minkowski sum algorithm for the computation of the Minkowski sum of a nonconvex--convex pair of polyhedra, which handles nonmanifold situations and extracts eventual polyhedral holes inside the Minkowski sum outer boundary. Our algorithm does not output boundaries that degenerate into a polyline or a single point. First, we generate a superset of the Minkowski sum facets through the use of the contributing vertices concept and by summing only the features (facets, edges, and vertices) of the input polyhedra which have coincident orientations. Secondly, we compute the 2D arrangements induced by the superset triangles intersections. Finally, we obtain the Minkowski sum through the use of two simple properties of the input polyhedra and the Minkowski sum polyhedron itself, that is, the closeness and the two-manifoldness properties. The NCC-CVMS algorithm is efficient because of the simplifications induced by the use of the contributing vertices concept, the use of 2D arrangements instead of 3D arrangements which are difficult to maintain, and the use of simple properties to recover the Minkowski sum mesh. We implemented our NCC-CVMS algorithm on the base of CGAL and used exact number types.
