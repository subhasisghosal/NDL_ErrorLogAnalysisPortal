Given a set of individuals, partitioned into healthy and diseased, and the corresponding sets of genotypes, we want to infer ``bad'' and ``good'' haplotypes to account for these genotypes and for the disease. Assume e.g. the disease is recessive. Then, the resolving haplotypes must consist of \\emph{bad} and \\emph{good} haplotypes, so that (i) each genotype belonging to a diseased individual is explained by a pair of bad haplotypes and (ii) each genotype belonging to a healthy individual is explained by a pair of haplotypes of which at least one is good. We prove that the associated decision problem is NP-complete. However, we also prove that there is a simple solution, provided the data satisfy a very weak requirement."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4355","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4355","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4355","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4356","fieldValue":" A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) is a positionin the genome at which two or more of the possible fournucleotides occur in a large percentage of the population. SNPsaccount for most of the genetic variability between individuals,and mapping SNPs in the human population has become thenext high-priority in genomics after the completion of the HumanGenome project. In diploid organisms such as humans, thereare two non-identical copies of each autosomal chromosome. Adescription of the SNPs in a chromosome is called a haplotype.At present, it is prohibitively expensive to directly determine thehaplotypes of an individual, but it is possible to obtain rather easilythe conflated SNP information in the so called genotype. Computationalmethods for genotype phasing, i.e., inferring haplotypesfrom genotype data, have received much attention in recent yearsas haplotype information leads to increased statistical power ofdisease association tests. However, many of the existing algorithmshave impractical running time for phasing large genotype datasetssuch as those generated by the international HapMap project.In this paper we propose a highly scalable algorithm based onentropy minimization. Our algorithm is capable of phasing bothunrelated and related genotypes coming from complex pedigrees.Experimental results on both real and simulated datasets showthat our algorithm achieves a phasing accuracy worse but closeto that of best existing methods while being several orders ofmagnitude faster.

After analyzing the limitations of mutual information in inferring the gene-to-gene interactions, this paper introduces the concept of conditional mutual information and based on it proposes two novel algorithms to infer the connectivity structure of genetic regulatory networks. One of the proposed algorithms exhibits a better accuracy while the other algorithm excels in simplicity and flexibility. By exploiting the mutual information and conditional mutual information, a practical metric is also proposed to assess the likeliness of direct connectivity between genes. This novel metric resolves a common limitation associated with the current inference algorithms, namely the situations where the gene connectivity is established in terms of the dichotomy of being either connected or disconnected. Based on the data sets generated by synthetic networks, the performance of the proposed algorithms is compared favorably relative to existing state-of-the-art schemes. The proposed algorithms are also applied on realistic biological measurements, such as the cutaneous melanoma data set, and biological meaningful results are inferred."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4357","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
