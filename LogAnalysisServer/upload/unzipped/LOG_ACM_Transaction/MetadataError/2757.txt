The algorithm is an extension of Freudenthal's subdivision method. The proposed algorithm deals with the more general case of kd$ subdivision, and is considerably simpler than the RedRefinementND algorithm for implementation of Freudenthal's strategy. The proposed simplex subdivision algorithm is motivated by a problem in the field of robust control theory: the computation of a tight upper bound of a dynamical system performance index by means of a branch-and-bound algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19153","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19153","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19154","fieldValue":" A translation to Fortran 90 of Gertrude Blanch's algorithm for computing the expansion coefficients of the series that represent Mathieu functions is presented.
