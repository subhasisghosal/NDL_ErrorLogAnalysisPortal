The system treats nth order space (one dimensional), first order time systems with initial and\/or two point boundary value specification. Users of the system need only enter the problem in direct mathematical notation, and output is automatically presented as a solution graph. The system allows the user to alter this equations, in-situ, that is to computationally steer his model. Thus the system is suited for model prototyping. Implementation is based on an object-oriented paradigm, well established and robust numerical procedures, and distributed computing to supported needed resources for numerically intensive tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18707","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18707","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18708","fieldValue":" Current approaches to recommending mathematical software are qualitative and categorical. These approaches are unsatisfactory when the problem to be solved has features that can â\u20ACœtrade-offâ\u20AC? in the recommendation process. A quantitative system is proposed that permits tradeoffs and can be built and modified incrementally. This quantitative approach extends other knowledge-engineering techniques in its knowledge representation and aggregation facilities. The system is demonstrated on the domain of ordinary differential equation initial value problems. The results are significantly superior to an existing qualitative (decision tree) system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18708","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18708","fieldValue":"ACM"}
