This is challenged by (1) the capacity-limited and time-variant uplink channel, (2) the resource-hungry upstreamed videos and their dynamically changing complexity, and (3) the different playout times of the video consumers. To address these issues, we propose a systematic approach for quality-of-experience (QoE)-based resource optimization and uplink transmission of multiuser generated video content. More specifically, we present an analytical model for distributed scalable video transmission at the mobile producers which considers these constraints. This is complemented by a multiuser cross-layer optimizer in the mobile network which determines the transmission capacity for each mobile terminal under current cell load and radio conditions. Both optimal and low-complexity solutions are presented. Simulation results for LTE uplink transmission show that significant gains in perceived video quality can be achieved by our cross-layer resource optimization scheme. In addition, the distributed optimization at the mobile producers can further improve the user experience across the different types of video consumers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25695","fieldValue":"Li, Li-Jia"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25695","fieldValue":"Van Zwol, Roelof"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25695","fieldValue":" Photos are an important information carrier for implicit relationships. In this article, we introduce an image based social network, called CelebrityNet, built from implicit relationships encoded in a collection of celebrity images. We analyze the social properties reflected in this image-based social network and automatically infer communities among the celebrities. We demonstrate the interesting discoveries of the CelebrityNet. We particularly compare the inferred communities with human manually labeled ones and show quantitatively that the automatically detected communities are highly aligned with that of human interpretation. Inspired by the uniqueness of visual content and tag concepts within each community of the CelebrityNet, we further demonstrate that the constructed social network can serve as a knowledge base for high-level visual recognition tasks. In particular, this social network is capable of significantly improving the performance of automatic image annotation and classification of unknown images."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25696","fieldValue":"De Natale, Francesco GB"}
