Nowadays, the massive size of some critical networksâ\u20AC\u201Doften stored in already overloaded relational databasesâ\u20AC\u201Deffectively limits the rate at which nodes and edges can be explored, making it a challenge to accurately discover subgraph statistics. In this work, we propose sampling methods to accurately estimate subgraph statistics from as few queried nodes as possible. We present sampling algorithms that efficiently and accurately estimate subgraph properties of massive networks. Our algorithms require no precomputation or complete network topology information. At the same time, we provide theoretical guarantees of convergence. We perform experiments using widely known datasets and show that, for the same accuracy, our algorithms require an order of magnitude less queries (samples) than the current state-of-the-art algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7991","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7992","fieldValue":" Ensemble clustering, as an important extension of the clustering problem, refers to the problem of combining different (input) clusterings of a given dataset to generate a final (consensus) clustering that is a better fit in some sense than existing clusterings. Over the past few years, many ensemble clustering approaches have been developed. However, most of them are designed for partitional clustering methods, and few research efforts have been reported for ensemble hierarchical clustering methods. In this article, a hierarchical ensemble clustering framework that can naturally combine both partitional clustering and hierarchical clustering results is proposed. In addition, a novel method for learning the ultra-metric distance from the aggregated distance matrices and generating final hierarchical clustering with enhanced cluster separation is developed based on the ultra-metric distance for hierarchical clustering. We study three important problems: dendrogram description, dendrogram combination, and dendrogram selection. We develop two approaches for dendrogram selection based on tree distances, and we investigate various dendrogram distances for representing dendrograms. We provide a systematic empirical study of the ensemble hierarchical clustering problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7992","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7992","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7993","fieldValue":" The problem of mobile context recognition targets the identification of semantic meaning of context in a mobile environment. This plays an important role in understanding mobile user behaviors and thus provides the opportunity for the development of better intelligent context-aware services. A key step of context recognition is to model the personalized contextual information of mobile users. Although many studies have been devoted to mobile context modeling, limited efforts have been made on the exploitation of the sequential and dependency characteristics of mobile contextual information. Also, the latent semantics behind mobile context are often ambiguous and poorly understood. Indeed, a promising direction is to incorporate some domain knowledge of common contexts, such as â\u20ACœwaiting for a busâ\u20AC? or â\u20ACœhaving dinner,â\u20AC? by modeling both labeled and unlabeled context data from mobile users because there are often few labeled contexts available in practice. To this end, in this article, we propose a sequence-based semisupervised approach to modeling personalized context for mobile users. Specifically, we first exploit the Bayesian Hidden Markov Model (B-HMM) for modeling context in the form of probabilistic distributions and transitions of raw context data. Also, we propose a sequential model by extending B-HMM with the prior knowledge of contextual features to model context more accurately. Then, to efficiently learn the parameters and initial values of the proposed models, we develop a novel approach for parameter estimation by integrating the Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model and the Mixture Unigram (MU) model. Furthermore, by incorporating both user-labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a semisupervised learning-based algorithm to identify and model the latent semantics of context. Finally, experimental results on real-world data clearly validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches for recognizing personalized context of mobile users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7993","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7993","fieldValue":"ACM"}
