Since their implementations generally require the use of heterogeneous resources (e.g., processor cores, ASICs) in one system with stringent design constraints, the importance of hardware\/software codesign methodologies increases steadily. Interfacing heterogeneous hardware and software components together through a communication structure is particularly error prone and time consuming. Hence, on the basis of a generic architecute dedicated to telecommunication and multimedia applications, we proposed an extended communication synthesis method that provides characterization of communications and their implementation schemes in the target architecture. This method takes place after the partitioning and scheduling phase and may constitute the basis of a back-end of a codesign framework leading to HW\/SW integration."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12779","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12779","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12780","fieldValue":" A novel technique, CLIP, is presented for the automatic generation of optimal layouts of CMOS cells in the two-dimensional (2D) style. CLIP is based on integer-linear programming (ILP) and solves both the width and height minimization problems for 2D cells. Width minimization is formulated in a precise form that combines all factors influencing the 2D cell widthâ\u20AC\u201Dtransistor placement, diffusion sharing, and vertical interrow connectionsâ\u20AC\u201Din a common problem space; this space is then searched in a systematic manner by the branch-and-bound algorithms used by ILP solvers. For height minimization, cell height is modeled accurately in terms of the horizontal wire routing density, and a minimum-height layout is found from among all layouts of minimum width. For exact width minimization alone, CLIP's run times are in seconds for large circuits with 30 or more transistors. For both height and width optimization, CLIP is practical for circuits with up to 20 transistors. To extend CLIP to larger circuits, hierarchical methods are necessary. Since CLIP is optimum under the modeling assumptions, its layouts are significantly better than those generated by other, heuristic, layout tools."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12780","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12780","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12781","fieldValue":" A new method for state justification is proposed for sequential circuit test generation. The linear list of states dynamically obtained during the derivation of test vectors is used to guide the search during state justification. State-transfer sequences that drive the circuit from the current state to the target state may already be known. Otherwise, genetic engineering of existing state-transfer sequences is required. In both cases, genetic-algorithm-based techniques are used to generate valid state justification sequences for the circuit in the presence of the target fault. This approach achieves extremely high fault coverages, and thus outperforms previous deterministic and simulation-based techniques."}
