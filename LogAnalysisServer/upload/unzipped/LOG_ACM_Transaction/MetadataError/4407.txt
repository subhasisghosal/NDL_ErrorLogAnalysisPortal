{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24265","fieldValue":" This article studies the \"filter effects\" that occur in Web proxy caching hierarchies due to the presence of multiple levels of caches. That is, the presence of one level of cache changes the structural characteristics of the workload presented to the next level of cache, since only the requests that miss in one cache are forwarded to the next cache.Trace-driven simulations, with empirical and synthetic traces, are used to demonstrate the presence and magnitude of the filter effects in a multilevel Web proxy caching hierarchy. Experiments focus on the effects of cache size, cache replacement policy, Zipf slope, and the depth of the Web proxy caching hierarchy.Finally, the article considers novel cache management techniques that can better exploit the changing workload characteristics across a multilevel Web proxy caching hierarchy. Trace-driven simulations are used to evaluate the performance of these approaches. The simulation results demonstrate that size-based partitioning and heterogeneous cache replacement policies each offer improvements in overall caching performance. The sensitivity of the results to the degree of workload overlap among child-level proxy caches is also studied."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24266","fieldValue":" We present the results of the project, which aimsto design and implement a high-level domain-specific language forprogramming interactive Web services.A fundamental aspect of the development of the World Wide Webduring the last decade is the gradual change from static to dynamicgeneration of Web pages. Generating Web pages dynamically in dialogwith the client has the advantage of providing up-to-date andtailor-made information. The development of systems forconstructing such dynamic Web services has emerged as a whole newresearch area.The language is designed by analyzing itsapplication domain and identifying fundamental aspects of Webservices inspired by problems and solutions in existing Web servicedevelopment languages. The core of the design consists of asession-centered service model together with a flexibletemplate-based mechanism for dynamic Web page construction. Usingspecialized program analyses, certain Web-specific properties areverified at compile time, for instance that only valid HTML 4.01 isever shown to the clients. In addition, the design provideshigh-level solutions to form field validation, caching of dynamicpages, and temporal-logic based concurrency control, and itproposes syntax macros for making highly domain-specificlanguages.The language is implemented via widely available Webtechnologies, such as Apache on the server-side and JavaScript andJava Applets on the client-side. We conclude with experience andevaluation of the project."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3352","fieldValue":"McNamara, Ann"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3352","fieldValue":" A new experiment is presented that demonstrates the usefulness of an image space modulation technique called subtle gaze direction (SGD) for guiding the user in a simple searching task. SGD uses image space modulations in the luminance channel to guide a viewer's gaze about a scene without interrupting their visual experience. The goal of SGD is to direct a viewer's gaze to certain regions of a scene without introducing noticeable changes in the image. Using a simple searching task, we compared performance using no modulation, using subtle modulation, and using obvious modulation. Results from the experiments show improved performance when using subtle gaze direction, without affecting the user's perception of the image. We then extend the experiment to evaluate performance with the presence of distractors. The distractors took the form of extra modulations, which do not correspond to a target in the image. Experimentation shows, that, even in the presence of distractors, more accurate results are returned on a simple search task using SGD, as compared to results returned when no modulation at all is used. Results establish the potential of the method for a wide range of applications including gaming, perceptually based rendering, navigation in virtual environments, and medical search tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3352","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3352","fieldValue":"ACM"}
