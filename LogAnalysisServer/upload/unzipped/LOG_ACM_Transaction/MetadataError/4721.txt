This article describes the Panoptes video-based sensor networking architecture, including its design, implementation, and performance. We describe two video sensor platforms that can deliver high-quality video over 802.11 networks with a power requirement less than 5 watts. In addition, we describe the streaming and prioritization mechanisms that we have designed to allow it to survive long-periods of disconnected operation. Finally, we describe a sample application and bitmapping algorithm that we have implemented to show the usefulness of our platform. Our experiments include an in-depth analysis of the bottlenecks within the system as well as power measurements for the various components of the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25241","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1258","fieldValue":" This article presents an ant-based approach that enhances the flexibility, robustness and load balancing characteristics of structured P2P systems. Most notably, the approach allows peer indexes and resource keys to be defined on different and independent spaces, so that it overcomes the main limitation of standard structured P2P systems, that is, the need to assign each key to a peer having a specified index. This helps to improve load balancing, especially when the popularity distribution of resource keys is nonuniform, and enables the efficient execution of complex and range queries, which are essential in important types of distributed systems, for example, in Grids and Clouds. Beyond describing the general approach, this article focuses on the specific case of Self-CAN, a self-organizing P2P system that, while relying on the multidimensional structured organization of peers provided by CAN, exploits the operations of ant-based mobile agents to sort the resource keys and distribute them to peers. This system is particularly useful for the management and discovery of the resources that can be conveniently characterized by the values of several independent attributes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25242","fieldValue":" Providing accurate and scalable solutions to map low-level perceptual features to high-level semantics is essential for multimedia information organization and retrieval. In this paper, we propose a confidence-based dynamic ensemble (CDE) to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional static classifiers. In contrast to the traditional models, CDE can make dynamic adjustments to accommodate new semantics, to assist the discovery of useful low-level features, and to improve class-prediction accuracy. We depict two key components of CDE: a multi-level function that asserts class-prediction confidence, and the dynamic ensemble method based upon the confidence function. Through theoretical analysis and empirical study, we demonstrate that CDE is effective in annotating large-scale, real-world image datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25242","fieldValue":"ACM"}
