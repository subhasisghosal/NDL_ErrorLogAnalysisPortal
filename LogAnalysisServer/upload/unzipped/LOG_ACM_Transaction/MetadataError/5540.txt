We will expound a family of convex optimization-based methods for estimating the transcription factor control strengths and the transcription factor activities (TFAs). The approach taken in this work is to decompose the problem into a network connectivity strength estimation phase and a transcription factor activity estimation phase. In the control strength estimation phase, we formulate a new subspace-based method incorporating a choice of multiple error metrics. For the source estimation phase we propose a total least squares (TLS) formulation that generalizes many existing methods. Both estimation procedures are noniterative and yield the optimal estimates according to various proposed error metrics. We test the performance of the proposed algorithms on simulated data and experimental gene expression data for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms have superior effectiveness in comparison with both Bayesian Decomposition (BD) and our previous FastNCA approach, while the computational complexity is still orders of magnitude less than BD."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4829","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4829","fieldValue":"Noise,Estimation,Convex functions,Least squares approximation,Gene expression,Data models,Computational modeling,bilinear model.,Transcriptional network reconstruction,network component analysis,total least squares"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4829","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4829","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4830","fieldValue":"Di Camillo, Barbara"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4830","fieldValue":" The systematic perturbation of the components of a biological system has been proven among the most informative experimental setups for the identification of causal relations between the components. In this paper, we present Systematic Perturbationâ\u20AC\u201DQualitative Reasoning (SPQR), a novel Qualitative Reasoning approach to automate the interpretation of the results of systematic perturbation experiments. Our method is based on a qualitative abstraction of the experimental data: for each perturbation experiment, measured values of the observed variables are modeled as lower, equal or higher than the measurements in the wild type condition, when no perturbation is applied. The algorithm exploits a set of IF-THEN rules to infer causal relations between the variables, analyzing the patterns of propagation of the perturbation signals through the biological network, and is specifically designed to minimize the rate of false positives among the inferred relations. Tested on both simulated and real perturbation data, SPQR indeed exhibits a significantly higher precision than the state of the art."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4830","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4830","fieldValue":"Systematics,Cognition,Biological information theory,Proteins,Biological system modeling,Mathematical model,protein signaling networks.,Qualitative reasoning,rule-based inference,systematic perturbation experiments,gene regulatory networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4830","fieldValue":"ACM"}
