Extensive measurements are performed for seven devices of different types (wireless routers, smartphones, tablets, and embedded devices) and for both UDP and TCP traffic. Experimental results unveil that a substantial fraction of energy consumption, hereafter descriptively named cross-factor, may be ascribed to each individual frame while it crosses the protocol stack (OS, driver, NIC) and is independent of the frame size. Our findings, summarized in a convenient energy consumption model, contrast traditional models that (implicitly) amortize such energy cost component in a fixed baseline cost or in a toll proportional to the frame size and raise the alert that, in some cases, conclusions drawn using traditional energy models may be fallacious."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10789","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10789","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10789","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10790","fieldValue":" As a fundamental tool for network management and security, traffic classification has attracted increasing attention in recent years. A significant challenge to the robustness of classification performance comes from zero-day applications previously unknown in traffic classification systems. In this paper, we propose a new scheme of Robust statistical Traffic Classification (RTC) by combining supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to meet this challenge. The proposed RTC scheme has the capability of identifying the traffic of zero-day applications as well as accurately discriminating predefined application classes. In addition, we develop a new method for automating the RTC scheme parameters optimization process. The empirical study on real-world traffic data confirms the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. When zero-day applications are present, the classification performance of the new scheme is significantly better than four state-of-the-art methods: random forest, correlation-based classification, semi-supervised clustering, and one-class SVM."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10790","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
