There have been fewer studies of the asymptotic capacity of large-scale wireless networks based on carrier-sensing multiple access (CSMA), which schedules transmissions in a distributed and random manner. With the rapid and widespread adoption of CSMA technology, a critical question is whether CSMA networks can be as scalable as TDMA networks. To answer this question and explore the capacity of CSMA networks, we first formulate the models of CSMA protocols to take into account the unique CSMA characteristics not captured by existing interference models in the literature. These CSMA models determine the feasible states, and consequently the capacity of CSMA networks. We then study the throughput efficiency of CSMA scheduling as compared to TDMA. Finally, we tune the CSMA parameters so as to maximize the throughput to the optimal order. As a result, we show that CSMA can achieve throughput as Ω(1\/√n), the same order as optimal centralized TDMA, on uniform random networks. Our CSMA scheme makes use of an efficient backbone-peripheral routing scheme and a careful design of dual carrier-sensing and dual channel scheme. We also address implementation issues of our CSMA scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10181","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10181","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10181","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10182","fieldValue":"Ho, Pin-Han"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10182","fieldValue":" Being reported as the most general monitoring structure for out-of-band failure localization approach, the monitoring trail (m-trail) framework has been witnessed with great efficiency and promises to serve in the future Internet backbone with all-optical mesh wavelength division multiplex (WDM) networks. Motivated by its potential and significance, this paper investigates failure localization in all-optical mesh networks using m-trails. By considering shared risk link groups (SRLGs) with up to all adjacent links of any node in the network, a novel algorithm of m-trail allocation for achieving unambiguous failure localization (UFL) of any single SRLG failure is developed. The proposed algorithm aims to minimize the number of required m-trails and can achieve superb performance with respect to the computation efficiency. We claim that among all the previously reported counterparts, this paper has considered one of the most applicable scenarios to the design of network backbone, and the proposed method can be easily extended to the case of node failure localization. Extensive simulation is conducted to verify the proposed algorithm in comparison to its existing counterparts."}
