Notwithstanding the impressive results obtained so far, mostly due to the advent of sequence encoding schemes based on multiple alignment, in our view the problem should be studied from a novel perspective, in which understanding how available information sources are dealt with plays a central role. After revisiting a well-known secondary structure predictor viewed from this perspective (with the goal of identifying which sources of information have been considered and which have not), we propose a generic software architecture designed to account for all relevant information sources. To demonstrate the validity of the approach, a predictor compliant with the proposed generic architecture has been implemented and compared with several state-of-the-art secondary structure predictors. Experiments have been carried out on standard data sets, and the corresponding results confirm the validity of the approach. The predictor is available at http:\/\/iasc.diee.unica.it\/ssp2\/ through the corresponding web application or as downloadable stand-alone portable unpack-and-run bundle."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4762","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4762","fieldValue":"Secondary structure prediction, protein encoding schemes, ensemble architectures, artificial neural networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4763","fieldValue":" The problem of identifying the proteins in a complex mixture using tandem mass spectrometry can be framed as an inference problem on a graph that connects peptides to proteins. Several existing protein identification methods make use of statistical inference methods for graphical models, including expectation maximization, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and full marginalization coupled with approximation heuristics. We show that, for this problem, the majority of the cost of inference usually comes from a few highly connected subgraphs. Furthermore, we evaluate three different statistical inference methods using a common graphical model, and we demonstrate that junction tree inference substantially improves rates of convergence compared to existing methods.
