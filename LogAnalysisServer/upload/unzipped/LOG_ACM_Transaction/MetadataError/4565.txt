Such subsequences occur in particular simulation setups or as methods to obtain parallel streams of pseudorandom numbers for parallel and distributed simulation. Especially in the latter case, two kinds of substreams are of special interest: lagged random numbers with step sizes k, and consecutive streams of random numbers of length l. We show how to analyze correlations within and between lagged subsequences with arbitrary step sizes k. Analyzing consecutive streams with the spectral test is related to the well-known long-range correlation analysis of linear congruential generators. Whereas the latter was carried out to show correlations between pairs of processors only, the spectral test provides a convenient method to study correlations between larger numbers of parallel streams as well."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24802","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24802","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24803","fieldValue":" A significant difficulty when using Monte Carlo simulation for the performance analysis of communication networks is the long runtime required to obtain accurate statistical estimates. Under the proper conditions, importance sampling (IS) is a technique that can speed up simulations involving rare events in network (queuing) systems. Large speed-up factors in simulation runtime can be obtained with IS if the modification or bias of the underlying probability measures of certain random processes is carefully chosen. Fast simulation methods based on large deviation theory (LTD) have been successfully applied in many cases.In this paper, we set up an IS-based simulation of various elementary network topologies. These configurations are frequenly encountered in broadband ATM-based network components such as switches and multiplexers. Our objective in this study is to obtain the optimal or near-optimal biasing parameter values of the arrival processes for the importance sampling simulation. For this purpose we appropriately apply a technique presented by Chang et al. for certain portions of the networks (intree) while we develop a new algorithm, inspired by the work of De Veciana et al. on decoupling bandwidths, for the non-intree portion of the network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24803","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24803","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24804","fieldValue":" We report on both theoretical developments and comutational experience with the patchwork rejection technique in Zechner and Stadlober [1993] and Zechner [1997]. The basic approach is due to Minh [1988], who suggested a special sampling method for the gamma distribution. The method's general objective is to rearrange the area below the density of histogram f (x) in the body of the distribution by certain point reflections such that variates may be generated efficiently within a large center interval. This is carried out via uniform hat functions, combined with minorizing rectangles for immediate acceptance of one transformed uniform deviate. The remaining tails of f(x) are covered by exponential functions. Experiments show that patchwork rejection algorithms are in general faster than their competitors at the cost of higher set-up times."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24804","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24804","fieldValue":"ACM"}
