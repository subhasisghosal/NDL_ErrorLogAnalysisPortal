A coarse binary classification of antigen regions into epitopes, or nonepitopes without specifying antibodies may not accurately reflect this biological reality. Therefore, we study an antibody-specified epitope prediction problem in line with this principle. This problem is new and challenging as we pinpoint a subset of the antigenic residues from an antigen when it binds to a specific antibody. We introduce two kinds of associations of the contextual awareness: 1) residues-residues pairing preference, and 2) the dependence between sets of contact residue pairs. Preference plays a bridging role to link interacting paratope and epitope residues while dependence is used to extend the association from one-dimension to two-dimension. The paratope\/epitope residues' relative composition, cooperativity ratios, and Markov properties are also utilized to enhance our method. A nonredundant data set containing 80 antibody-antigen complexes is compiled and used in the evaluation. The results show that our method yields a good performance on antibody-specified epitope prediction. On the traditional antibody-ignored epitope prediction problem, a simplified version of our method can produce a competitive, sometimes much better, performance in comparison with three structure-based predictors."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4667","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4667","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4667","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4668","fieldValue":" The classification of G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) sequences is an important problem that arises from the need to close the gap between the large number of orphan receptors and the relatively small number of annotated receptors. Equally important is the characterization of GPCR Class A subfamilies and gaining insight into the ligand interaction since GPCR Class A encompasses a very large number of drug-targeted receptors. In this work, we propose a method for Class A subfamily classification using sequence-derived motifs which characterizes the subfamilies by discovering receptor-ligand interaction sites. The motifs that best characterize a subfamily are selected by the Distinguishing Power Evaluation (DPE) technique we propose. The experiments performed on GPCR sequence databases show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classification techniques for GPCR Class A subfamily prediction. An important contribution of our work is to discover key receptor-ligand interaction sites which is very important for drug design."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4668","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4669","fieldValue":" Contour extraction of Drosophila (fruit fly) embryos is an important step to build a computational system for matching expression pattern of embryonic images to assist the discovery of the nature of genes. Automatic contour extraction of embryos is challenging due to severe image variations, including 1) the size, orientation, shape, and appearance of an embryo of interest; 2) the neighboring context of an embryo of interest (such as nontouching and touching neighboring embryos); and 3) illumination circumstance. In this paper, we propose an automatic framework for contour extraction of the embryo of interest in an embryonic image. The proposed framework contains three components. Its first component applies a mixture model of quadratic curves, with statistical features, to initialize the contour of the embryo of interest. An efficient method based on imbalanced image points is proposed to compute model parameters. The second component applies active contour model to refine embryo contours. The third component applies eigen-shape modeling to smooth jaggy contours caused by blurred embryo boundaries. We test the proposed framework on a data set of 8,000 embryonic images, and achieve promising accuracy (88 percent), that is, substantially higher than the-state-of-the-art results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4669","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
