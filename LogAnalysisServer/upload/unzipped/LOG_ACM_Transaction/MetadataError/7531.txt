The complete capture enables not just statistics as seen from outside the router, but also an accurate physical router model to be identified. This enables a comprehensive examination of congestion and delay from three points of view: the understanding of origins, measurement, and reporting. Our study defines new methodologies and metrics. In particular, the traffic reporting enables a rich description of the diversity of microcongestion behavior, without model assumptions, and at achievable computational cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9870","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9870","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9870","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9871","fieldValue":" We develop algorithms for the compact representation of the 1- and 2-dimensional tries that are used for Internet packet classification.

Furthermore, the single-cycle line transfer suggested in prior studies adversely affects Level-1 Data Cache (L1 DC) area and energy efficiency. We propose a practical DFC that is accessed early in the pipeline and transfers a line over multiple cycles. Our DFC design improves performance and eliminates a substantial fraction of L1 DC accesses for loads, L1 DC tag checks on stores, and data translation lookaside buffer accesses for both loads and stores. Our evaluation shows that the proposed DFC can reduce the data access energy by 42.5&percnt; and improve execution time by 4.2&percnt;."}
