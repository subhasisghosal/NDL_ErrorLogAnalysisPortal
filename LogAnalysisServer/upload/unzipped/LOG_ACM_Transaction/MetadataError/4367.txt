The incompleteness of question tags severely hinders all the tag-based manipulations, such as feeds for topic-followers, ontological knowledge organization, and other basic statistics. This article presents a novel scheme that is able to comprehensively learn descriptive tags for each question. Extensive evaluations on a representative real-world dataset demonstrate that our scheme yields significant gains for question annotation, and more importantly, the whole process of our approach is unsupervised and can be extended to handle large-scale data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24095","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24095","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24096","fieldValue":" Ranked result lists with query-dependent snippets have become state of the art in text search. They are typically implemented by searching, at query time, for occurrences of the query words in the top-ranked documents. This document-based approach has three inherent problems: (i) when a document is indexed by terms which it does not contain literally (e.g., related words or spelling variants), localization of the corresponding snippets becomes problematic; (ii) each query operator (e.g., phrase or proximity search) has to be implemented twice, on the index side in order to compute the correct result set, and on the snippet-generation side to generate the appropriate snippets; and (iii) in a worst case, the whole document needs to be scanned for occurrences of the query words, which could be problematic for very long documents. We present a new index-based method that localizes snippets by information solely computed from the index and that overcomes all three problems. Unlike previous index-based methods, we show how to achieve this at essentially no extra cost in query processing time, by a technique we call operator inversion. We also show how our index-based method allows the caching of individual segments instead of complete documents, which enables a significantly larger cache hit-ratio as compared to the document-based approach. We have fully integrated our implementation with the CompleteSearch engine."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24096","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24096","fieldValue":"ACM"}
