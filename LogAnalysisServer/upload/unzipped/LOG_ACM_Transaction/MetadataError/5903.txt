This study introduces a novel application of multifractal statistical methods to distinguish users via patterns of variability within high frequency pupillary response behavior (PRB) data collected during computer-based interaction. PRB was measured from older adults, including two groups diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) maintaining a range of visual acuities (n &equals; 14), and one visually healthy control group (i.e., disease-free, 20\/20--20\/32 acuity) (n &equals; 14). Three measures of the multifractal spectrum, the distribution of regularity indices extracted from time series data, distinguished the user groups, including: 1) Spectral Mode; 2) Broadness; and 3) Left Slope. The results demonstrate a clear relationship between the values of these measures and the level of visual capabilities. These analytical techniques leverage the inherent complexity and richness of this high frequency physiological response data, which can be used to meaningfully differentiate individuals whose sensory and cognitive capabilities may be affected by aging and visual impairment. Multifractality analysis provides an objective, quantifiable means of uncovering and examining the underlying signatures in physiological behavior that may account for individual differences in interaction needs and behaviors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5673","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5673","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5674","fieldValue":" This article presents an analysis of the human to human interactions in two public online newsgroups, one targeting the young generation and the other the elderly. The main goal of this study was to establish a better understanding of similarities and differences in the ways of interacting among the participants of these two newsgroups. A series of analytical\/statistical techniques, like Social Network Analysis (SNA), were used in order to get a better understanding of the online communities that have emerged around the participants of these two newsgroups. The SNA analysis showed that the teens newsgroup is more highly connected, has more messages sent and received and has a higher reciprocity. On the other hand, the senior newsgroup has more central dominant people who tend to make the rest of the network dependent on them for communication."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5674","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5674","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5675","fieldValue":" In the last few years, teenagers have been on the forefront of adopting short message service (SMS), a mobile phone-based text messaging system, and instant messaging (IM), a computer-based text chat system. However, while teenage adoption of SMS had led to a series of studies examining the reasons for its popularity, IM use in the teenage population remains understudied. This omission becomes significant given the increasing interest in domestic computing among human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) researchers. Further, because of the dearth of empirical work on teenage use of IM, we find that IM and SMS are sometimes incorrectly assumed to share the same features of use. To address these concerns, we revisit our own studies of SMS and IM use and reexamine them in tandem with other published studies on teenage chat. We consider similarities and differences in styles of SMS and IM use and how chat technologies enable the pursuit of teenage independence. We examine how differences are born out of technological differences and financial cost structures. We discuss how SMS and IM are used in concert to provide increased awareness and to coordinate inter-household communications, and how privacy is regulated within the individual household as a means of maintaining these communications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5675","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5675","fieldValue":"ACM"}
