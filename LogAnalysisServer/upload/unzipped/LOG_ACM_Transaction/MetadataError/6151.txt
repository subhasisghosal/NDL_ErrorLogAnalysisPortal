A set of realistic assumptions is considered in the model in order to apply the results in practical real-time applications. The processor is assumed to have as a set of discrete operating modes, each characterized by speed and power consumption. The energy overhead and the transition delay incurred during mode switches are considered. Task computation times are modeled with a part that scales with the speed and a part having a fixed duration, to take I\/O operations into account. The proposed method allows to compute the optimal sequence of voltage\/speed changes that approximates the minimum continuous speed, which guarantees the feasibility of a given set of real-time tasks, without violating the deadline constraints. The analysis is performed both under fixed and dynamic priority assignments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6415","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6416","fieldValue":"Koo, Heon-Mo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6416","fieldValue":" Functional verification of microprocessors is one of the most complex and expensive tasks in the current system-on-chip design methodology. Simulation using functional test vectors is the most widely used form of processor validation. A significant bottleneck in the validation of such systems is the lack of automated techniques for directed test generation. While existing model checking--based approaches have proposed several promising ideas for automated test generation, many challenges remain in applying them to industrial microprocessors. The time and resources required for test generation using existing model checking--based techniques can be prohibitively large. This article presents an efficient test generation technique using decompositional model checking. The contribution of the article is the development of both property and design decomposition procedures for efficient test generation of pipelined processors. Our experimental results using a multi-issue MIPS processor and an industrial processor based on Power Architecture#8482; Technology demonstrate several orders-of-magnitude reduction in validation effort by drastically reducing both test generation time and test program length."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6416","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6417","fieldValue":"Guest editorial CAPA'08 configurable computing: Configuring algorithms, processes, and architecture issue I: Configuring algorithms and processes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6417","fieldValue":"ACM"}
