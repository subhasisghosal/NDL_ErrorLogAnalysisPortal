At the same time, many emerging Internet applications, such as teleeducation, and teleconferencing, require multicast protocols that will provide the necessary QoS. In this paper, we propose QoSMIC, a multicast routing protocol for the Internet, that provides QoS-sensitive paths in a scalable, resource-efficient, and flexible way. QoSMIC differs from the previous protocols in that it identifies multiple paths and selects the one that can provide the required QoS. Two other key advantages of QoSMIC are its flexibility and adaptivity. First, the distribution tree does not have to be rooted at a preselected core router. Second, we can tradeoff between efficiency metrics depending on our needs; for example, we can tradeoff routing efficiency for a reduction in the control messages. Extensive simulations show that our protocol improves the resources utilization and the end-to-end performance compared to the current protocols. Specifically, our protocol reduces the call blocking probability by a factor of six and reduces the end-to-end delay by as much as 90% compared to the PIM protocol."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9076","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9076","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9076","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1815","fieldValue":" Most scientific computations serve to apply mathematical operations to a set of preconceived data structures, e.g., matrices, vectors, and grids. In this article, we use a number of widely used matrix computations from the LINPACK library to demonstrate that complex internal organizations of data structures can severely degrade the effectiveness of compiler optimizations. We then present a data-layout-oblivious optimization methodology, where by isolating an abstract representation of the computations from complex implementation details of their data, we enable these computations to be much more accurately analyzed and optimized through varying state-of-the-art compiler technologies. We evaluated our approach on an Intel 8-core platform using two source-to-source compiler infrastructures, Pluto and EPOD. Our results show that while the efficiency of a computational kernel differs when using different data layouts, the alternative implementations typically benefit from a common set of optimizations on the operations. Therefore separately optimizing the operations and the data layout of a computation could dramatically enhance the effectiveness of compiler optimizations compared with the conventional approaches of using a unified representation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1815","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1815","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9077","fieldValue":" We propose a flow-control scheme for multicast ABR services in ATM networks. At the heart of the proposed scheme is an optimal second-order rate control algorithm, called the α-control, designed to deal with the variation in RM-cell round-trip time (RTT) resulting from dynamic drift of the bottleneck in a multicast tree. Applying two-dimensional rate control, the proposed scheme makes the rate process converge to the available bandwidth of the connection's most congested rink sensed by the traffic source. It also confines the buffer occupancy to a target regime bounded by a finite buffer capacity as the system enters the equilibrium state. It works well irrespective of the topology of the multicast tree. Using the fluid analysis, we model the proposed scheme and analyze the system dynamics for multicast ABR traffic. We study the convergence properties and derive the optimal-control conditions for the α-control. The analytical results show that the scheme is stable and efficient in the sense that both the source rate and bottleneck queue length rapidly converge to a small neighborhood of the designated operating point. We present simulation results which verify the analytical observations. The simulation experiments also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme to the other schemes in dealing with RM-cell RTT and link-bandwidth variations, achieving fairness in both buffer and bandwidth occupancies, and enhancing average throughput."}
