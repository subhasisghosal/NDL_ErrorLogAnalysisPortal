Such environments may consist of many inexpensive nodes, each capable of collecting, storing, and processing environmental information, and communicating with neighboring nodes through wireless links. For a sensor network to operate successfully, sensors must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity. This issue has been studied in wang et al. [2003] and Zhang and Hou [2004a], both of which reach a similar conclusion that coverage can imply connectivity as long as sensors' communication ranges are no less than twice their sensing ranges. In this article, without relying on this strong assumption, we investigate the issue from a different angle and develop several necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring coverage and connectivity of a sensor network. Hence, the results significantly generalize the results in Wang et al. [2003] and Zhang and Hou [2004a]. This work is also a significant extension of our earlier work [Huang and Tseng 2003; Huang et al. 2004], which addresses how to determine the level of coverage of a given sensor network but does not consider the network connectivity issue. Our work is the first work allowing an arbitrary relationship between sensing ranges and communication distances of sensor nodes. We develop decentralized solutions for determining, or even adjusting, the levels of coverage and connectivity of a given network. Adjusting levels of coverage and connectivity is necessary when sensors are overly deployed, and we approach this problem by putting sensors to sleep mode and tuning their transmission powers. This results in prolonged network lifetime."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21209","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21209","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21210","fieldValue":" In this article, we examine the energy consumption of a set of sensors that transmit correlated information to a base station either directly or in an ad-hoc multihop fashion. Building on a single-hop distributed data rate allocation scheme, we present an efficient approximation algorithm for the NP-hard joint routing and data compression problem whose objective is to maximize the operation lifetime of the sensor networks. We prove that the performance of our algorithm lies within 1\/O(log n) of the optimum value where n is the number of sensors. We use simulations to validate our intuitions and provide additional insights on the factors that impact the performance of the approximation scheme. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme performs close to the optimum."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21210","fieldValue":"A combinatorial algorithmic approach to energy efficient information collection in wireless sensor networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21210","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21210","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21211","fieldValue":" Experimental studies have demonstrated that the behavior of real links in low-power wireless networks (such as wireless sensor networks) deviates to a large extent from the ideal binary model used in several simulation studies. In particular, there is a large transitional region in wireless link quality that is characterized by significant levels of unreliability and asymmetry, significantly impacting the performance of higher-layer protocols. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the root causes of unreliability and asymmetry. In particular, we derive expressions for the distribution, expectation, and variance of the packet reception rate as a function of distance, as well as for the location and extent of the transitional region. These expressions incorporate important environmental and radio parameters such as the path loss exponent and shadowing variance of the channel, and the modulation, encoding, and hardware variance of the radios."}
