For a given deployment region size, we calculate the Pareto frontier of the sensor network utility at the desired probabilities for d-connectivity and k-coverage. As a result of our analysis, we determine (1) the number of sensors of different types to deploy from a sensor pool, which offers a cost vs. performance trade-off for each type of sensor, (2) the minimum required radio transmission ranges of the sensors to ensure connectivity, and (3) the lifetime of the sensor network. For generality, we consider randomly deployed sensor networks and formulate constrained optimization technique to obtain the localization performance. The approach is guided and validated using an unattended acoustic sensor network design. Finally, approximations of the complete statistical characterization of the acoustic sensor networks are given, which enable average network performance predictions of any combination of acoustic sensors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21273","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21273","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21274","fieldValue":" This article presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of EnviroMic, a low-cost experimental prototype of a novel distributed acoustic monitoring, storage, and trace retrieval system designed for disconnected operation. Our intended use of acoustic monitoring is to study animal populations in the wild. Since a permanent connection to the outside world is not assumed and due to the relatively large size of audio traces, the system must optimally exploit available resources such as energy and network storage capacity. Towards that end, we design, prototype, and evaluate distributed algorithms for coordinating acoustic recording tasks, reducing redundancy of data stored by nearby sensors, filtering out silence, and balancing storage utilization in the network. For experimentation purposes, we implement EnviroMic on a TinyOS-based platform and systematically evaluate its performance through both indoor testbed experiments and an outdoor deployment. Results demonstrate up to a four-fold improvement in effective storage capacity of the network compared to uncoordinated recording."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21275","fieldValue":" Motivated by recently surfacing viruses that can spread over the air interfaces, in this article, we investigate the potentially disastrous threat of node compromise spreading in wireless sensor networks. We assume such a compromise originating from a single infected node, can propagate to other sensor nodes via communication and pre-established mutual trust. We focus on the possible epidemic breakout of such propagations where the whole network may fall victim to the attack. Using epidemic theory, we model and analyze this spreading process and identify key factors determining potential outbreaks. In particular, we perform our study on random graphs precisely constructed according to the parameters of the network, such as distance, key sharing constrained communication and node recovery, thereby reflecting the true characteristics therein. Moreover, a comparative study of the epidemic propagation is performed based on the effects of two types of sensor deployment strategies, viz., uniform random and group-based deployment. The analytical results provide deep insights in designing potential defense strategies against this threat. Furthermore, through extensive simulations, we validate the model and perform investigations on the system dynamics. Our analysis and simulation results indicate that the uniform random deployment is more vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak than the group based deployment strategy."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21275","fieldValue":"Deployment-aware modeling of node compromise spread in wireless sensor networks using epidemic theory"}
