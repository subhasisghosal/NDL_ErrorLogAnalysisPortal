CSS-sprite is a technique of combining many pictures of a web page into one image for the purpose of reducing network transfer time. The CSS-sprite packing problem is formulated here as an optimization challenge. The significance of geometric packing, image compression and communication performance is discussed. A mathematical model for constructing multiple sprites and optimization of load time is proposed. The impact of PNG-sprite aspect ratio on file size is studied experimentally. Benchmarking of real user web browsers communication performance covers latency, bandwidth, number of concurrent channels as well as speedup from parallel download. Existing software for building CSS-sprites is reviewed. A novel method, called Spritepack, is proposed and evaluated.
