{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10686","fieldValue":" In cellular networks, a recent trend in research is to make spectrum access dynamic in the spatial and temporal dimensions for the sake of efficient utilization of spectrum. In one such model, the spectrum is divided into channels and periodically allocated to competing base stations using an auction-based market mechanism. An \"efficient\" auction mechanism is essential to the success of such a dynamic spectrum access model. A key objective in designing an auction mechanism is \"truthfulness.\" Combining this objective with an optimization of some social choice function (such as the social-welfare or the generated revenue) is highly desirable. In this paper, we design polynomial-time spectrum auction mechanisms that are truthful and yield an allocation with O(1)-approximate social-welfare or revenue. Our mechanisms generalize to general interference models. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to design polynomial-time truthful spectrum auction mechanisms with a constant-factor approximation of either the expected revenue or the social-welfare. We demonstrate the performance of our designed mechanism through simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10686","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10686","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10686","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10687","fieldValue":" Radio frequency identification (RFID) cardinality estimation with an accuracy guarantee is of practical importance in various large-scale RFID applications. This paper proposes a fast RFID cardinality estimation protocol, named Zero-One Estimator (ZOE). ZOE only requires 1-bit response from the RFID tags per estimation round. More importantly, ZOE rapidly converges to optimal parameter configurations and achieves higher estimation efficiency compared to existing protocols. ZOE guarantees arbitrary accuracy requirement without imposing heavy computation and memory overhead at RFID tags except the routine operations of C1G2 standard. ZOE also provides reliable cardinality estimation with unreliable channels due to the robust protocol design. We prototype ZOE using the USRP software defined radio and the Intel WISP tags. We extensively evaluate the performance of ZOE compared to existing protocols, which demonstrates encouraging results in terms of estimation accuracy, time efficiency, as well as robustness over a large range of tag population."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10687","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10688","fieldValue":" This paper presents the design and implementation of PUMA, a declarative constraint-solving platform for policy-based routing and channel selection in multiradio wireless mesh networks. In PUMA, users formulate channel selection policies as optimization goals and constraints that are concisely declared using the Colog declarative language. To efficiently execute Colog programs in a distributed setting, PUMA integrates a high-performance constraint solver with a declarative networking engine. We demonstrate the capabilities of PUMA in defining distributed protocols that cross-optimize across channel selection and routing. We have developed a prototype of the PUMA system that we extensively evaluated in simulations and on the ORBIT testbed. Our experimental results demonstrate that PUMA can flexibly and efficiently implement a variety of centralized and distributed channel selection protocols that result in significantly higher throughput compared to single-channel and identical-channel assignment solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10688","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
