Analyzing the users' decision process using eyetracking and comparing implicit feedback against manual relevance judgments, we conclude that clicks are informative but biased. While this makes the interpretation of clicks as absolute relevance judgments difficult, we show that relative preferences derived from clicks are reasonably accurate on average. We find that such relative preferences are accurate not only between results from an individual query, but across multiple sets of results within chains of query reformulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23935","fieldValue":"Kan, Min-Yen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23935","fieldValue":"Chua, Tat-Seng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23935","fieldValue":" We explore probabilistic lexico-syntactic pattern matching, also known as soft pattern matching, in a definitional question answering system. Most current systems use regular expression-based hard matching patterns to identify definition sentences. Such rigid surface matching often fares poorly when faced with language variations. We propose two soft matching models to address this problem: one based on bigrams and the other on the Profile Hidden Markov Model (PHMM). Both models provide a theoretically sound method to model pattern matching as a probabilistic process that generates token sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the models on definition sentence retrieval for definitional question answering. We show that both models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art manually constructed hard matching patterns on recent TREC data. A critical difference between the two models is that the PHMM has a more complex topology. We experimentally show that the PHMM can handle language variations more effectively but requires more training data to converge. While we evaluate soft pattern models only on definitional question answering, we believe that both models are generic and can be extended to other areas where lexico-syntactic pattern matching can be applied."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23935","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23935","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23936","fieldValue":" Accurate topical classification of user queries allows for increased effectiveness and efficiency in general-purpose Web search systems. Such classification becomes critical if the system must route queries to a subset of topic-specific and resource-constrained back-end databases. Successful query classification poses a challenging problem, as Web queries are short, thus providing few features. This feature sparseness, coupled with the constantly changing distribution and vocabulary of queries, hinders traditional text classification. We attack this problem by combining multiple classifiers, including exact lookup and partial matching in databases of manually classified frequent queries, linear models trained by supervised learning, and a novel approach based on mining selectional preferences from a large unlabeled query log. Our approach classifies queries without using external sources of information, such as online Web directories or the contents of retrieved pages, making it viable for use in demanding operational environments, such as large-scale Web search services. We evaluate our approach using a large sample of queries from an operational Web search engine and show that our combined method increases recall by nearly 40&percnt; over the best single method while maintaining adequate precision. Additionally, we compare our results to those from the 2005 KDD Cup and find that we perform competitively despite our operational restrictions. This suggests it is possible to topically classify a significant portion of the query stream without requiring external sources of information, allowing for deployment in operationally restricted environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23936","fieldValue":"ACM"}
