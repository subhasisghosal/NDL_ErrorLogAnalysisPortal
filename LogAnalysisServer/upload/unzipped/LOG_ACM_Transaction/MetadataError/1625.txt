However, the perceptual impact of this trade-off has never been studied. In this paper, we consider the ways in which an impression of variety can be created and the perceptual consequences of certain design choices. In a series of experiments designed to test people's perception of variety in crowds, we found that clones of appearance are far easier to detect than motion clones. Furthermore, we established that cloned models can be masked by color variation, random orientation, and motion. Conversely, the perception of cloned motions remains unaffected by the model on which they are displayed. Other factors that influence the ability to detect clones were examined, such as proximity, model type and characteristic motion. Our results provide novel insights and useful thresholds that will assist in creating more realistic, heterogeneous crowds."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15898","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15898","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2507","fieldValue":" An out-tree T of a directed graph D is a rooted tree subgraph with all arcs directed outwards from the root. An out-branching is a spanning out-tree. By &ell;(D) and $&ell;_s(D), we denote the maximum number of leaves over all out-trees and out-branchings of D, respectively. We give fixed parameter tractable algorithms for deciding whether &ell;s(D) â\u2030¥ k and whether &ell;(D) â\u2030¥ k for a digraph D on n vertices, both with time complexity $2^O(k log k) Â· nO(1). This answers an open question whether the problem for out-branchings is in FPT, and improves on the previous complexity of 2O(klog 2 k) Â· nO(1)$ in the case of out-trees. To obtain the complexity bound in the case of out-branchings, we prove that when all arcs of D are part of at least one out-branching, &ell;s (D) â\u2030¥ &ell;(D)\/3. The second bound we prove in this article states that for strongly connected digraphs D with minimum in-degree 3, &ell;s(D) â\u2030¥ Î˜(&sqrt;n), where previously &ell;s$(D) â\u2030¥ Î˜(3&sqrt;n) was the best known bound. This bound is tight, and also holds for the larger class of digraphs with minimum in-degree 3 in which every arc is part of at least one out-branching."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2507","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2507","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15899","fieldValue":"DeWeese, John"}
