We show that these four concepts, namely 1) nonlinear definition of the path length; 2) a k-shortest path approach; 3) nondominance; and 4) look-ahead, are fundamental building blocks of a multiconstrained routing algorithm. The main reasons to consider exact multiconstrained routing algorithms are as follows. First, the NP-complete behavior seems only to occur in specially constructed graphs, which are unlikely to occur in realistic communication networks. Second, there exist exact algorithms that are equally complex as heuristics in algorithmic structure and in running time on topologies that do not induce NP-complete behavior. Third, by simply restricting the number k of paths explored during the path computation, the computational complexity can be decreased at the expense of possibly loosing exactness. The presented four concepts are incorporated in SAMCRA, a self-adaptive multiple constraints routing algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9254","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9254","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9254","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9255","fieldValue":" The problem of call admission control (CAC) is considered for leaky bucket constrained sessions with deterministic service guarantees (zero loss and finite delay bound) served by a generalized processor sharing scheduler at a single node in the presence of best effort traffic. Based on an optimization process, a CAC algorithm capable of determining the (unique) optimal solution is derived. The derived algorithm is also applicable, under a slight modification, in a system where the best effort traffic is absent and is capable of guaranteeing that if it does not find a solution to the CAC problem, then a solution does not exist. The numerical results indicate that the CAC algorithm can achieve a significant improvement on bandwidth utilization as compared to a (deterministic) effective bandwidth-based CAC scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9255","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9255","fieldValue":"ACM"}
