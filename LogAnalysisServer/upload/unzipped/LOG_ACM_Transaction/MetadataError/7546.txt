In this paper, a cross-layer methodology for the analysis of error control schemes in WSNs is presented such that the effects of multi-hop routing and the broadcast nature of the wireless channel are investigated. More specifically, the cross-layer effects of routing, medium access, and physical layers are considered. This analysis enables a comprehensive comparison of forward error correction (FEC) codes, automatic repeat request (ARQ), and hybrid ARQ schemes in WSNs. The validation results show that the developed framework closely follows simulation results. Hybrid ARQ and FEC schemes improve the error resiliency of communication compared to ARQ. In a multi-hop network, this improvement can be exploited by constructing longer hops (hop length extension), which can be achieved through channel-aware routing protocols, or by reducing the transmit power (transmit power control). The results of our analysis reveal that for hybrid ARQ schemes and certain FEC codes, the hop length extension decreases both the energy consumption and the end-to-end latency subject to a target packet error rate (PER) compared to ARQ. This decrease in end-to-end latency is crucial for delay sensitive, real-time applications, where both hybrid ARQ and FEC codes are strong candidates. We also show that the advantages of FEC codes are even more pronounced as the network density increases. On the other hand, transmit power control results in significant savings in energy consumption at the cost of increased latency for certain FEC codes. The results of our analysis also indicate the cases where ARQ outperforms FEC codes for various end-to-end distance and target PER values."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9900","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1898","fieldValue":"Seepers, Robert M"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1898","fieldValue":"Peris-Lopez, Pedro"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1898","fieldValue":" Secure and energy-efficient communication between Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) and authorized external users is attracting increasing attention these days. However, there currently exists no systematic approach to the problem, while solutions from neighboring fields, such as wireless sensor networks, are not directly transferable due to the peculiarities of the IMD domain. This work describes an original, efficient solution for secure IMD communication. A new implant system architecture is proposed, where security and main-implant functionality are made completely decoupled by running the tasks onto two separate cores. Wireless communication goes through a custom security ASIP, called SISC (Smart-Implant Security Core), which runs an energy-efficient security protocol. The security core is powered by RF-harvested energy until it performs external-reader authentication, providing an elegant defense mechanism against battery Denial-of-Service (DoS) and other, more common attacks. The system has been evaluated based on a realistic case study involving an artificial pancreas implant. When synthesized for a UMC 90nm CMOS ASIC technology, our system architecture achieves defense against unauthorized accesses having zero energy cost, running entity authentication through harvesting only 7.45Î¼J of RF energy from the requesting entity. In all other successfully authenticated accesses, our architecture achieves secure data exchange without affecting the performance of the main IMD functionality, adding less than 1â\u20AC° (1.3mJ) to the daily energy consumption of a typical implant. Compared to a singe-core, secure reference IMD, which would still be more vulnerable to some types of attacks, our secure system on chip (SoC) achieves high security levels at 56&percnt; energy savings and at an area overhead of less than 15&percnt;."}
