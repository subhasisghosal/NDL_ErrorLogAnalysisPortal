Recent advances in chip fabrication technology enable 3-D circuit manufacturing. However, there is still a possible barrier of design complexity in exploiting 3-D technologies. This article discusses the impact of migrating from 2-D to 3-D on the difficulty of floorplanning and placement. By looking at a basic formulation of the graph cuboidal dual problem, we show that the 3-D cases and the 3-layer 2.5-D cases are fundamentally more difficult than the 2-D cases in terms of computational complexity. By comparison among these cases, the intrinsic complexity in 3-D floorplan structures is revealed in the hard-to-decide relations between topological connections and geometrical contacts. The results show possible challenges in the future for physical design and CAD of 3-D integrated circuits."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13193","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2257","fieldValue":"Goodrich, Michael T"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2257","fieldValue":" We present memory-efficient deterministic algorithms for constructing &epsi;-nets and &epsi;-approximations of streams of geometric data. Unlike probabilistic approaches, these deterministic samples provide guaranteed bounds on their approximation factors. We show how our deterministic samples can be used to answer approximate online iceberg geometric queries on data streams. We use these techniques to approximate several robust statistics of geometric data streams, including Tukey depth, simplicial depth, regression depth, the Thiel-Sen estimator, and the least median of squares. Our algorithms use only a polylogarithmic amount of memory, provided the desired approximation factors are at least inverse-polylogarithmic. We also include a lower bound for noniceberg geometric queries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2257","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2257","fieldValue":"ACM"}
