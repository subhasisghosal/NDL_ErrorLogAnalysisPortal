In this article, we study the problem of supporting various path queries over the tree T. The path counting query asks for the number of the nodes on a query path whose weights are in a query range, while the path reporting query requires to report these nodes. The path median query asks for the median weight on a path between two given nodes, and the path selection query returns the k-th smallest weight. We design succinct data structures to encode T using n $nH(W_T) + 2n + o(nlg σ) bits of space, such that we can support path counting queries in O(lg σ\/lg lg n + 1)) time, path reporting queries in O((occ+1)(lg σ \/ lg lg n + 1)) time, and path median and path selection queries in O(lg σ \/ lg lg σ) time, where H(WT$) is the entropy of the multiset of the weights of the nodes in T and occ is the size of the output. Our results not only greatly improve the best known data structures [Chazelle 1987; Krizanc et al. 2005], but also match the lower bounds for path counting, median, and selection queries [Pǎtraşcu 2007, 2011; Jørgensen and Larsen 2011] when &sigma &equals; &Omega(n\/polylog(n))."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2727","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2727","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18404","fieldValue":"ACM"}
