This article presents an adaptive speculative processing technique for out-of-order event streams that enhances typical buffering approaches. In contrast to other stream revision approaches developed so far, our novel technique encapsulates the event detector, uses the buffering technique to delay events but also speculatively processes a portion of it, and adapts the degree of speculation at runtime to fit the available system resources so that detection latency becomes minimal. Our technique outperforms known approaches on both synthetical data and real sensor data from a realtime locating system (RTLS) with several thousands of out-of-order sensor events per second. Speculative buffering exploits system resources and reduces latency by 40&percnt; on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3374","fieldValue":" Thirty-nine participants viewed six interior scenes in an office\/laboratory building and rated them for brightness, uniformity, pleasantness, and glare. The scenes were viewed in three presentation modes: participants saw the real space and images of the spaces on a 17-inch computer monitor in both conventional and high dynamic range (HDR) mode. HDR mode allowed the high range of luminances in the real scene to be accurately reproduced, with maximum luminances more than 10 times higher than those in the conventional images. For those participants who saw the images before the real spaces (the most relevant order for practical applications), the HDR images were rated as significantly more realistic than the conventional images. However, this effect was limited to scenes with relatively large areas of high luminance, which in this study was represented by scenes with windows and daylight. Ratings of the HDR images were significantly related to simple photometric descriptors of the images in the expected manner: Brightness and glare ratings were positively correlated with overall and elevated luminance, and nonuniformity ratings were positively correlated with luminance variability. These results suggest that for evaluations of visual appearance of interior scenes featuring large areas of high luminance, the HDR method may be used as a surrogate for experiencing a real space both for lighting quality research, and in the design process."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3374","fieldValue":"Comparing lighting quality evaluations of real scenes with those from high dynamic range and conventional images"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3374","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24470","fieldValue":"Jayaram, K R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24470","fieldValue":" Despite the prognosed use of event correlation techniques for monitoring critical complex infrastructures or dealing with disasters in the physical world, little work exists on making event correlation systems themselves tolerant to failure. Existing systems either provide no guarantees on event deliveries, do not support multicast and thus provide no guarantees across individual processes, or then rely on centralized components or strong assumptions on the infrastructure. The FAIDECS system attempts to reconcile strong guarantees with practical performance in the presence of process crash failures. To that end, the FAIDECS system uses an overlay network with specific guarantees aligned with its proposed correlation language and guarantees. However, the language proposed lacks expressivity, and the system itself supports only very specific rigid semantics, incapable of supporting even fundamental features like sliding windows. After providing a comprehensive overview of the FAIDECS model and system, this article bridges the gap between strong guarantees and more established correlation languages and systems in several steps. First, we propose alternative semantics for several modules of the FAIDECS matching engine and revisit guarantees. Second, we pinpoint which guarantees are contradicted by which combinations of semantic options. Third, we investigate four correlation languagesâ\u20AC\u201DStreamSQL, EQL, CEL, and TESLAâ\u20AC\u201Dshowing which semantic options their respective features correspond to in our model, and thus, ultimately, which guarantees of FAIDECS are maintained by which language features."}
