This complicates the Minimum-Energy Multicasting (MEM) problem, which was primarily studied in always-active wireless ad hoc networks. In this paper, we study the duty-cycle-aware MEM problem in wireless sensor networks both for one-to-many multicasting and for all-to-all multicasting. In the case of one-to-many multicasting, we present a formalization of the Minimum-Energy Multicast Tree Construction and Scheduling (MEMTCS) problem. We prove that the MEMTCS problem is NP-hard, and it is unlikely to have an approximation algorithm with a performance ratio of (1 - o(1)) In Î\u201D, where Î\u201D is the maximum node degree in a network. We propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the MEMTCS problem with a performance ratio of O(H(Î\u201D+1)), where H(Ä\u2039) is the harmonic number. In the case of all-to-all multicasting, we prove that the Minimum-Energy Multicast Backbone Construction and Scheduling (MEMBCS) problem is also NP-hard and present an approximation algorithm for it, which has the same approximation ratio as that of the proposed algorithm for the MEMTCS problem. We also provide a distributed implementation of our algorithms, as well as a simple but efficient collision-free scheduling scheme to avoid packet loss. Finally, we perform extensive simulations, and the results demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform other known algorithms in terms of the total transmission energy cost, without sacrificing much of the delay performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10469","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10470","fieldValue":" Fast searching a particular subset in a large number of products attached with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags is of practical importance for a variety of applications, but not yet thoroughly investigated. Since the cardinality of the products can be extremely large, collecting the tag information directly from each of those tags could be highly inefficient. To address the tag searching efficiency in large-scale RFID systems, this paper proposes several algorithms to meet the stringent delay requirement in developing fast tag searching protocols. We formally formulate the tag searching problem in large-scale RFID systems. We propose utilizing compact approximators to efficiently aggregate a large volume of RFID tag information and exchange such information with a two-phase approximation protocol. By estimating the intersection of two compact approximators, the proposed two-phase compact approximator-based tag searching protocol significantly reduces the searching time compared to all possible solutions we can directly borrow from existing studies. We further introduce a scalable cardinality range estimation method that provides inexpensive input for our tag searching protocol. We conduct comprehensive simulations to validate our design. The results demonstrate that the proposed tag searching protocol is highly efficient in terms of both time efficiency and transmission overhead, leading to good applicability and scalability for large-scale RFID systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10470","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10470","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10470","fieldValue":"ACM"}
