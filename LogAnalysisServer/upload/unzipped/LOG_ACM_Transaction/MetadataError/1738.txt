First, we devise randomized approximation algorithms for multicriteria maximum traveling salesman problems (Max-TSP). For multicriteria Max-STSP where the edge weights have to be symmetric, we devise an algorithm with an approximation ratio of 2\/3 - &epsiv;. For multicriteria Max-ATSP where the edge weights may be asymmetric, we present an algorithm with a ratio of 1\/2 - &epsiv;. Our algorithms work for any fixed number k of objectives. Furthermore, we present a deterministic algorithm for bicriteria Max-STSP that achieves an approximation ratio of 7\/27. Finally, we present a randomized approximation algorithm for the asymmetric multicriteria minimum TSP with triangle inequality (Min-ATSP). This algorithm achieves a ratio of log n + &epsiv;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16182","fieldValue":" Dirt on camera lenses, and occlusions from thin objects such as fences, are two important types of artifacts in digital imaging systems. These artifacts are not only an annoyance for photographers, but also a hindrance to computer vision and digital forensics. In this paper, we show that both effects can be described by a single image formation model, wherein an intermediate layer (of dust, dirt or thin occluders) both attenuates the incoming light and scatters stray light towards the camera. Because of camera defocus, these artifacts are low-frequency and either additive or multiplicative, which gives us the power to recover the original scene radiance pointwise. We develop a number of physics-based methods to remove these effects from digital photographs and videos. For dirty camera lenses, we propose two methods to estimate the attenuation and the scattering of the lens dirt and remove the artifacts -- either by taking several pictures of a structured calibration pattern beforehand, or by leveraging natural image statistics for post-processing existing images. For artifacts from thin occluders, we propose a simple yet effective iterative method that recovers the original scene from multiple apertures. The method requires two images if the depths of the scene and the occluder layer are known, or three images if the depths are unknown. The effectiveness of our proposed methods are demonstrated by both simulated and real experimental results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16182","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16182","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16183","fieldValue":" This paper presents a fast deblurring method that produces a deblurring result from a single image of moderate size in a few seconds. We accelerate both latent image estimation and kernel estimation in an iterative deblurring process by introducing a novel prediction step and working with image derivatives rather than pixel values. In the prediction step, we use simple image processing techniques to predict strong edges from an estimated latent image, which will be solely used for kernel estimation. With this approach, a computationally efficient Gaussian prior becomes sufficient for deconvolution to estimate the latent image, as small deconvolution artifacts can be suppressed in the prediction. For kernel estimation, we formulate the optimization function using image derivatives, and accelerate the numerical process by reducing the number of Fourier transforms needed for a conjugate gradient method. We also show that the formulation results in a smaller condition number of the numerical system than the use of pixel values, which gives faster convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that our method runs an order of magnitude faster than previous work, while the deblurring quality is comparable. GPU implementation facilitates further speed-up, making our method fast enough for practical use."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16183","fieldValue":"ACM"}
