{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15981","fieldValue":" Simulated characters in simulated worlds require simulated skills. We develop control strategies that enable physically-simulated characters to dynamically navigate environments with significant stepping constraints, such as sequences of gaps. We present a synthesis-analysis-synthesis framework for this type of problem. First, an offline optimization method is applied in order to compute example control solutions for randomly-generated example problems from the given task domain. Second, the example motions and their underlying control patterns are analyzed to build a low-dimensional step-to-step model of the dynamics. Third, this model is exploited by a planner to solve new instances of the task at interactive rates. We demonstrate real-time navigation across constrained terrain for physics-based simulations of 2D and 3D characters. Because the framework sythesizes its own example data, it can be applied to bipedal characters for which no motion data is available."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15982","fieldValue":"Shum, Hubert P H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15982","fieldValue":" We propose a data-driven approach to automatically generate a scene where tens to hundreds of characters densely interact with each other. During off-line processing, the close interactions between characters are precomputed by expanding a game tree, and these are stored as data structures called interaction patches. Then, during run-time, the system spatio-temporally concatenates the interaction patches to create scenes where a large number of characters closely interact with one another. Using our method, it is possible to automatically or interactively produce animations of crowds interacting with each other in a stylized way. The method can be used for a variety of applications including TV programs, advertisements and movies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15982","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15982","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15983","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15983","fieldValue":"Yeh, I-Cheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15983","fieldValue":"Lee, Tong-Yee"}
