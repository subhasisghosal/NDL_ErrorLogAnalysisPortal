The aim of this work is to reduce, as much as possible, repetitive tasks and to factor out common aspects into different kinds of rules that can be reused across different applications. In particular, exploiting the conceptual elements of the typical models used for the design of a Web application, it defines presentation and layout rules at different levels of abstraction and granularity. A procedure for the automatic layout of the content of a page is proposed and evaluated, and the layout of advanced Web applications is discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23250","fieldValue":" We study the problem of automatically extracting information networks formed by recognizable entities as well as relations among them from social media sites. Our approach consists of using state-of-the-art natural language processing tools to identify entities and extract sentences that relate such entities, followed by using text-clustering algorithms to identify the relations within the information network. We propose a new term-weighting scheme that significantly improves on the state-of-the-art in the task of relation extraction, both when used in conjunction with the standard tf Ä\u2039 idf scheme and also when used as a pruning filter. We describe an effective method for identifying benchmarks for open information extraction that relies on a curated online database that is comparable to the hand-crafted evaluation datasets in the literature. From this benchmark, we derive a much larger dataset which mimics realistic conditions for the task of open information extraction. We report on extensive experiments on both datasets, which not only shed light on the accuracy levels achieved by state-of-the-art open information extraction tools, but also on how to tune such tools for better results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23250","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23250","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23251","fieldValue":" Publish\/subscribe systems have emerged in recent years as a promising paradigm for offering various popular notification services. In this context, many XML filtering systems have been proposed to efficiently identify XML data that matches user interests expressed as queries in an XML query language like XPath. However, in order to offer XML filtering functionality on an Internet-scale, we need to deploy such a service in a distributed environment, avoiding bottlenecks that can deteriorate performance. In this work, we design and implement FoXtrot, a system for filtering XML data that combines the strengths of automata for efficient filtering and distributed hash tables for building a fully distributed system. Apart from structural-matching, performed using automata, we also discuss different methods for evaluating value-based predicates. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our system, FoXtrot, on a local cluster and on the PlanetLab network and demonstrate that it can index millions of user queries, achieving a high indexing and filtering throughput. At the same time, FoXtrot exhibits very good load-balancing properties and improves its performance as we increase the size of the network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23251","fieldValue":"ACM"}
