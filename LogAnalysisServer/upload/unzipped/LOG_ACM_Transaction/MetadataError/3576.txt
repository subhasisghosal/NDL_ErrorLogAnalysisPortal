{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21611","fieldValue":" Two-tiered wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs) have been proposed to enhance network capabilities, where a set of resource-rich mobile nodes (termed actors) form a connected backbone to relay sensing data from static sensors to the sink and sometimes are requested by sensors to perform a particular action. Such a two-tiered WSAN facilitates scalability and can efficiently reduce the energy consumption incurred by conventional hop-by-hop relaying via only sensors. However, relocating actors to achieve both connectivity and load balance is a challenge, especially when there is no location information of the nodes. Connectivity ensures that the actors are connected, whereas load balance ensures that actors collect and originate a similar amount of sensory data from the sensors. In this article, we formulate the Connected and Balanced Mobile Actor Relocation (CBMAR) optimization problem to address both connectivity and load balance and prove that the problem is NP-hard. We thus propose a dual-mode distributed actor relocation protocol that does not rely on any location information of nodes to relocate actors. The idea is to locally form virtual Voronoi cells of actors (termed covering cells) based on the lower-tiered topology, where each actor locally recruits its own sensor members to form its own covering cell. By maintaining the covering cell, each actor locally relocates itself toward a sensor along the lower-tiered topology. Extensive simulation results show that the protocol can achieve both objectives of connectivity and load balance with low moving and communication overheads."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21611","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21611","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21612","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of fusing measurements in a sensor network, where the sensing regions overlap and data are nonnegative real numbers, possibly resulting from a count of indistinguishable discrete entities. Because of overlaps, it is generally impossible to fuse this information to arrive at an accurate value of the overall amount or count of material present in the union of the sensing regions. Here we study the computation of the range of overall values consistent with the data and provide several results. Posed as a linear programming problem, this leads to questions associated with the geometry of the sensor regions, specifically the arrangement of their nonempty intersections. We define a computational tool called the fusion polytope, based on the geometry of the sensing regions. Its properties are explored, and in particular, a topological necessary and sufficient condition for this to be in the positive orthant, a property that considerably simplifies calculations, is provided. We show that in two dimensions, inflated tiling schemes based on rectangular regions fail to satisfy this condition, whereas inflated tiling schemes based on hexagons do."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21612","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21612","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21613","fieldValue":" The unique aquatic nature of swimming makes it difficult to use social or technical strategies to mitigate the tediousness of monotonous exercises. In this study, we propose the use of a smartphone-based multiplayer exergame named MobyDick. MobyDick is designed to be played while swimming, where a team of swimmers collaborate to hunt down a virtual monster. To this end, we take into account both human factors and technical challenges under swimming contexts. First, we perform a comparative analysis of a variety of wireless networking technologies in the aquatic environment and identify various technical constraints on wireless networking. Second, we develop a swimming activity recognition system to enable precise and real-time game inputs. Third, we devise a multiplayer game design by employing the unique interaction mode viable in an underwater environment, where the abilities of human communication are highly limited. Finally, we prototype MobyDick on waterproof off-the-shelf Android phones, and we deploy it in real swimming pool environments (n &equals; 8). Our qualitative analysis of user interview data reveals certain unique aspects of multiplayer swimming games."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21613","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21613","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21614","fieldValue":" Carpooling has long held the promise of reducing gas consumption by decreasing mileage to deliver coriders. Although ad hoc carpools already exist in the real world through private arrangements, little research on the topic has been done. In this article, we present the first systematic work to design, implement, and evaluate a carpool service, called coRide, in a large-scale taxicab network intended to reduce total mileage for less gas consumption. Our coRide system consists of three components, a dispatching cloud server, passenger clients, and an onboard customized device, called TaxiBox. In the coRide design, in response to the delivery requests of passengers, dispatching cloud servers calculate cost-efficient carpool routes for taxicab drivers and thus lower fares for the individual passengers. To improve coRideâ\u20AC™s efficiency in mileage reduction, we formulate an NP-hard route calculation problem under different practical constraints. We then provide (1) an optimal algorithm using Linear Programming, (2) a 2-approximation algorithm with a polynomial complexity, and (3) its corresponding online version with a linear complexity. To encourage coRideâ\u20AC™s adoption, we present a win-win fare model as the incentive mechanism for passengers and drivers to participate. We test the performance of coRide by a comprehensive evaluation with a real-world trial implementation and a data-driven simulation with 14,000 taxi data from the Chinese city Shenzhen. The results show that compared with the ground truth, our service can reduce 33&percnt; of total mileage; with our win-win fare model, we can lower passenger fares by 49&percnt; and simultaneously increase driver profit by 76&percnt;."}
