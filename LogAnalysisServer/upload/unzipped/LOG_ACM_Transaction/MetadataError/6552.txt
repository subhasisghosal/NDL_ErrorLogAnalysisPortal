However, in most real world recommender systems, context information, such as time and social networks, are also very important factors that could be considered in order to produce more accurate recommendations. In this work, we address several challenges for the context aware movie recommendation tasks in CAMRa 2010: (1) how to combine multiple heterogeneous forms of user feedback&quest; (2) how to cope with dynamic user and item characteristics&quest; (3) how to capture and utilize social connections among users&quest; For the first challenge, we propose a novel ranking based matrix factorization model to aggregate explicit and implicit user feedback. For the second challenge, we extend this model to a sequential matrix factorization model to enable time-aware parametrization. Finally, we introduce a network regularization function to constrain user parameters based on social connections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the collective modeling of social and temporal dynamics. Experiments on the CAMRa 2010 dataset demonstrated clear improvements over many baselines."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7457","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7457","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1678","fieldValue":" With large-scale integration and increasing power densities, thermal management has become an important tool to maintain performance and reliability in modern process technologies. In the core of dynamic thermal management schemes lies accurate reading of on-die temperatures. Therefore, careful planning and embedding of thermal monitoring mechanisms into high-performance systems becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose three techniques to create sensor infrastructures for monitoring the maximum temperature on a multicore system. Initially, we extend a nonuniform sensor placement methodology proposed in the literature to handle chip multiprocessors (CMPs) and show its limitations. We then analyze a grid-based approach where the sensors are placed on a static grid covering each core and show that the sensor readings can differ from the actual maximum core temperature by as much as 12.6Â°C when using 16 sensors per core. Also, as large as 10.6&percnt; of the thermal emergencies are not captured using the same number of sensors. Based on this observation, we first develop an interpolation scheme, which estimates the maximum core temperature through interpolation of the readings collected at the static grid points. We show that the interpolation scheme improves the measurement accuracy and emergency coverage compared to grid-based placement when using the same number of sensors. Second, we present a dynamic scheme where only a subset of the sensor readings is collected to predict the maximum temperature of each core. Our results indicate that, we can reduce the number of active sensors by as much as 50&percnt;, while maintaining similar measurement accuracy and emergency coverage compared to the case where the entire sensor set on the grid is sampled at all times."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1678","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1678","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7458","fieldValue":" Context-aware recommendation seeks to improve recommendation performance by exploiting various information sources in addition to the conventional user-item matrix used by recommender systems. We propose a novel context-aware movie recommendation algorithm based on joint matrix factorization (JMF). We jointly factorize the user-item matrix containing general movie ratings and other contextual movie similarity matrices to integrate contextual information into the recommendation process. The algorithm was developed within the scope of the mood-aware recommendation task that was offered by the Moviepilot mood track of the 2010 context-aware movie recommendation (CAMRa) challenge. Although the algorithm could generalize to other types of contextual information, in this work, we focus on two: movie mood tags and movie plot keywords. Since the objective in this challenge track is to recommend movies for a user given a specified mood, we devise a novel mood-specific movie similarity measure for this purpose. We enhance the recommendation based on this measure by also deploying the second movie similarity measure proposed in this article that takes into account the movie plot keywords. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed JMF algorithm with respect to the recommendation performance by carrying out experiments on the Moviepilot challenge dataset. We demonstrate that exploiting contextual information in JMF leads to significant improvement over several state-of-the-art approaches that generate movie recommendations without using contextual information. We also demonstrate that our proposed mood-specific movie similarity is better suited for the task than the conventional mood-based movie similarity measures. Finally, we show that the enhancement provided by the movie similarity capturing the plot keywords is particularly helpful in improving the recommendation to those users who are significantly more active in rating the movies than other users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7459","fieldValue":" Which risk should one choose when facing alternatives with different levels of risk&quest; We discuss here adaptive processes in such risk choice behavior by generalizing the study of Roos et al. [2010]. We deal with an n-choice game in which every player sequentially chooses n times of lotteries of which there are two types: a safe lottery and a risky lottery. We analyze this model in more detail by elaborating the game. Based on the results of mathematical analysis, replicator dynamics analysis, and numerical simulations, we derived some salient features of risk choice behavior. We show that all the risk strategies can be divided into two groups: persistence and nonpersistence. We also proved that the dynamics with perturbation in which a mutation is installed is globally asymptotically stable to a unique equilibrium point for any initial population. The numerical simulations clarify that the number of persistent strategies seldom increases regardless of the increase in n, and suggest that a rarity of dominant choice strategies is widely observed in many social contexts. These facts not only go hand-in-hand with some well-known insights from prospect theory, but may also provide some theoretical hypotheses for various fields such as behavioral economics, ecology, sociology, and consumer behavioral theory."}
