Unfortunately, quaternion rotation is often left as an advanced topic in computer graphics education due to difficulties in portraying the four-dimensional space of the quaternions. One tool for overcoming these obstacles is the quaternion demonstrator, a physical visual aid consisting primarily of a belt. Every quaternion used to specify a rotation can be represented by fixing one end of the belt and rotating the other. Multiplication of quaternions is demonstrated by the composition of rotations, and the resulting twists in the belt depict visually how quaternions interpolate rotation.This article introduces to computer graphics the exponential notation that mathematicians have used to represent unit quaternions. Exponential notation combines the angle and axis of the rotation into concise quaternion expression. This notation allows the article to present more clearly a mechanical quaternion demonstrator consisting of a ribbon and a tag, and develop a computer simulation suitable for interactive educational packages. Local deformations and the belt trick are used to minimize the ribbon's twisting and simulate a natural-appearing interactive quaternion demonstrator."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15103","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15103","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15104","fieldValue":" An intersection detection method for solid modeling which is invariant under projective transformations is presented. We redefine the fundamental geometric figures necessary to describe solid models and their dual figures in a homogeneous coordinate representation. Then we derive conditions, which are projectively invariant, for intersections between these primitives. We will show that a geometric processor based on the 4 x 4 determinant method is applicable to a wide range of problems with little modification. This method has applications in intersection detections of rational parametric curves and surfaces and hidden-line\/surface removal algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/15104","fieldValue":"4 &times; 4 determinant method"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15104","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15104","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1016","fieldValue":" Compile-time elimination of subscript range checks is performed by some optimizing compilers to reduce the overhead associated with manipulating array data structures. Elimination and propagation, the two methods of subscript range check optimization, are less effective for eliminating global redundancies especially in while-loop structures with nonconstant loop guards. This paper describes a subscript range check optimization procedure that can eliminate more range checks than current methods. Two transformations called inner-loop guard elimination and conservative expression substitution are introduced to enhance propagation of range checks in nested while-loops and to define a partial order on related range checks. Global elimination is improved by considering range checks performed before control reaches a statement and after control leaves a statement. A unique feature of this method is the simplification of the available range-check analysis system for global elimination."}
