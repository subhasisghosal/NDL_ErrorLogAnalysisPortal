Drawing from findings in cognitive psychology, we propose to investigate the simple combination of two dedicated approaches for separating those two components: a rhythm-based method that focuses on extracting the background via a rhythmic mask derived from identifying the repeating time elements in the mixture and a pitch-based method that focuses on extracting the melody via a harmonic mask derived from identifying the predominant pitch contour in the mixture. Evaluation on a data set of song clips showed that combining such two contrasting yet complementary methods can help to improve separation performance--from the point of view of both components--compared with using only one of those methods, and also compared with two other state-of-the-art approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3729","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3729","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1283","fieldValue":" The fast-spreading worm, which immediately propagates itself after a successful infection, is becoming one of the most serious threats to todayâ\u20AC™s networked information systems. In this article, we present WormTerminator, a host-based solution for fast Internet worm detection and containment with the assistance of virtual machine techniques based on the fast-worm defining characteristic. In WormTerminator, a virtual machine cloning the host OS runs in parallel to the host OS. Thus, the virtual machine has the same set of vulnerabilities as the host. Any outgoing traffic from the host is diverted through the virtual machine. If the outgoing traffic from the host is for fast worm propagation, the virtual machine should be infected and will exhibit worm propagation pattern very quickly because a fast-spreading worm will start to propagate as soon as it successfully infects a host. To prove the concept, we have implemented a prototype of WormTerminator and have examined its effectiveness against the real Internet worm Linux\/Slapper. Our empirical results confirm that WormTerminator is able to completely contain worm propagation in real-time without blocking any non-worm traffic. The major performance cost of WormTerminator is a one-time delay to the start of each outgoing normal connection for worm detection. To reduce the performance overhead, caching is utilized, through which WormTerminator will delay no more than 6&percnt; normal outgoing traffic for such detection on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1283","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1283","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3730","fieldValue":" This paper proposes a high-precision graphic equalizer based on second-order parallel filters. Previous graphic equalizers suffer from interaction between adjacent band filters, especially at high gain values, which can lead to substantial errors in the magnitude response. The fixed-pole design of the proposed parallel graphic equalizer avoids this problem, since the parallel second-order filters are optimized jointly. When the number of pole frequencies is twice the number of command points of the graphic equalizer, the proposed non-iterative design matches the target curve with high precision. In the three example cases presented in this paper, the proposed parallel equalizer clearly outperforms other non-iterative graphic equalizer designs, and its maximum global error is as low as 0.00-0.75 dB when compared to the target curve. While the proposed design has superior accuracy, the number of operations in the filter structure is increased only by 23% when compared to the second-order Regalia-Mitra structure. The parallel structure also enables the utilization of parallel computing hardware, which can nowadays easily outperform the traditional serial processing. The proposed graphic equalizer can be widely used in audio signal processing applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3730","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3730","fieldValue":"ACM"}
