Our work exhibits several important properties that include: 1) routing decisions are made locally by network nodes without the centralized information of the entire network topology; 2) routing decisions minimize throughput loss under a single-link attack with respect to different session models; and 3) routing decisions address multiple link attacks via lexicographic optimization. We devise two algorithms termed the Bound-Control algorithm and the Lex-Control algorithm, both of which provide provably optimal solutions. Experiments show that the Bound-Control algorithm is more effective to prevent the worst-case single-link attack when compared to the single-path approach, and that the Lex-Control algorithm further enhances the Bound-Control algorithm by countering severe single-link attacks and various types of multi-link attacks. Moreover, the Lex-Control algorithm offers prominent protection after only a few execution rounds, implying that we can sacrifice minimal routing protection for significantly improved algorithm performance. Finally, we examine the applicability of our proposed algorithms in a specialized defensive network architecture called the attack-resistant network and analyze how the algorithms address resiliency and security in different network settings."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9686","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9686","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9686","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9687","fieldValue":" As a security mechanism at the network-layer, the IP security protocol (IPsec) has been available for years, but its usage is limited to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The end-to-end security services provided by IPsec have not been widely used. To bring the IPsec services into wide usage, a standard IPsec API is a potential solution. However, the realization of a user-friendly IPsec API involves many modifications on the current IPsec and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) implementations. An alternative approach is to configure application-specific IPsec policies, but the current IPsec policy system lacks the knowledge of the context of applications running at upper layers, making it infeasible to configure application-specific policies in practice. In this paper, we propose an application-aware IPsec policy system on the existing IPsec\/IKE infrastructure, in which a socket monitor running in the application context reports the socket activities to the application policy engine. In turn, the engine translates the application policies into the underlying security policies, and then writes them into the IPsec Security Policy Data-base (SPD) via the existing IPsec policy management interface. We implement a prototype in Linux (Kernel 2.6) and evaluate it in our testbed. The experimental results show that the overhead of policy translation is insignificant, and the overall system performance of the enhanced IPsec is comparable to those of security mechanisms at upper layers. Configured with the application-aware IPsec policies, both secured applications at upper layers and legacy applications can transparently obtain IP security enhancements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9687","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9688","fieldValue":"Liu, K.

While most existing group key management schemes are designed for single level access control, we present a multi-group key management scheme that achieves hierarchical group access control. Particularly, we design an integrated key graph that maintains keying material for all members with different access privileges. It also incorporates new functionalities that are not present in conventional multicast key management, such as user relocation on the key graph. Analysis is performed to evaluate the storage and communication overhead associated key management. Comprehensive simulations are performed for various application scenarios where users statistical behavior is modelled using a discrete Markov chain. Compared with applying existing key management schemes directly to the hierarchical access control problem, the proposed scheme significantly reduces the overhead associated with key management and achieves better scalability."}
