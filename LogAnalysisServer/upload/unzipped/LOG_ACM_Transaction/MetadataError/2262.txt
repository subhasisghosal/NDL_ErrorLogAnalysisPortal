In contrast, recent research has focused increasingly on an alternative paradigm, inspired largely by the nest building behavior of social insects, in which components â\u20ACœself-assembleâ\u20AC? into a given target structure. Adapting such a nature-inspired approach to precisely self-assemble artificial structures (bridge, building, etc.) presents a formidable challenge: one must create a set of local control rules to direct the behavior of the individual components\/agents during the self-assembly process. In recent work, we developed a fully automated procedure that generates such rules, allowing a given structure to successfully self-assemble in a simulated environment having constrained, continuous motion; however, the resulting rule sets were typically quite large. In this article, we present a more effective methodology for automatic rule generation, which makes an attempt to parsimoniously capture both the repeating patterns that exist within a structure, and the behaviors necessary for appropriate coordination. We then empirically show that the procedure developed here generates sets of rules that are not only correct, but significantly reduced in size, relative to our earlier approach. Such rule sets allow for simpler agents that are nonetheless still capable of performing complex tasks, and therefore demonstrate the problem-solving potential of self-organized systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1190","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1190","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17505","fieldValue":" The visual appearance of many materials is created by micro-scale details of their surface geometry. In this article, we investigate a new approach to capturing the appearance of metal surfaces without reflectance measurements, by deriving microfacet distributions directly from measured surface topography. Modern profilometers are capable of measuring surfaces with subwavelength resolution at increasingly rapid rates. We consider both wave- and geometric-optics methods for predicting BRDFs of measured surfaces and compare the results to optical measurements from a gonioreflectometer for five rough metal samples. Surface measurements are also used to predict spatial variation, or texture, which is especially important for the appearance of our anisotropic brushed metal samples. Profilometer-based BRDF acquisition offers many potential advantages over traditional techniques, including speed and easy handling of anisotropic, highly directional materials. We also introduce a new generalized normal distribution function, the ellipsoidal NDF, to compactly represent nonsymmetric features in our measured data and texture synthesis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17505","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17506","fieldValue":"Cani, Marie-Paule"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17506","fieldValue":"Wang, Charlie C L"}
