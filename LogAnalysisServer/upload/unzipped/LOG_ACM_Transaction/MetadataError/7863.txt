{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10539","fieldValue":" Network neutrality and the role of regulation on the Internet have been heavily debated in recent times. Among the various definitions of network neutrality, we focus on the one that prohibits paid prioritization of content. We develop a model of the Internet ecosystem in terms of three primary players: consumers, ISPs, and content providers. We analyze this issue from the point of view of the consumer and target the desired system state that maximizes consumer utility. By analyzing various structures of an ISP market, we obtain different conclusions on the desirability of regulation. We also introduce the notion of a Public Option ISP, an ISP that carries traffic in a network-neutral manner. We find: 1) in a monopolistic scenario, network-neutral regulations might benefit consumers, however the introduction of a Public Option ISP is even better as it aligns the interests of the monopolistic ISP with the consumer utility; and 2) in an oligopolistic scenario, the presence of a Public Option ISP is again preferable to network-neutral regulations, although the presence of competing nonneutral ISPs provides the most desirable situation for the consumers."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10539","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10539","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10539","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10540","fieldValue":"Li, Xiang-Yang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10540","fieldValue":" Constructive interference-based flooding (CIBF) is a latency-optimal flooding protocol, which can realize millisecond network flooding latency and submicrosecond time synchronization accuracy, require no network state information, and be adapted to topology changes. However, constructive interference (CI) has a precondition to function, i.e., the maximum temporal displacement Î\u201D of concurrent packet transmissions should be less than a given hardware constrained threshold (e.g., 0.5 Âµs, for the IEEE 802.15.4 radio). In this paper, we derive the closed-form packet reception ratio (PRR) formula for CIBF and theoretically disclose that CIBF suffers the scalability problem. The packet reception performance of intermediate nodes degrades significantly as the density or the size of the network increases. We analytically show that CIBF has a PRR lower bound (94.5%) in the grid topology. Based on this observation, we propose the spine constructive interference-based flooding (SCIF) protocol for an arbitrary uniformly distributed topology. Extensive simulations show that SCIF floods the entire network much more reliably than the state-of-the-art Glossy protocol does in high-density or large-scale networks. We further explain the root cause of CI with waveform analysis, which is mainly examined in simulations and experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10540","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10540","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10540","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10541","fieldValue":"Cervell-Pastor, Cristina"}
