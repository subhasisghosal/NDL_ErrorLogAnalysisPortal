Since biological systems such as breast cancer tumors respond differently to various treatments, little is known about exactly how these gene regulatory networks GRNs operate under different stimuli. Challenges due to the lack of knowledge not only occur in modeling the dynamics of a GRN but also cause bias or uncertainties in identifying parameters or inferring the GRN structure. This paper describes a new algorithm which enables us to estimate bias error due to the effect of perturbations and correctly identify the common graph structure among biased inferred graph structures. To do this, we retrieve common dynamics of the GRN subject to various perturbations. We refer to the task as â\u20ACœrepairingâ\u20AC? inspired by â\u20ACœimage repairingâ\u20AC? in computer vision. The method can automatically correctly repair the common graph structure across perturbed GRNs, even without precise information about the effect of the perturbations. We evaluate the method on synthetic data sets and demonstrate an application to the DREAM data sets and discuss its implications to experiment design."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5351","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5352","fieldValue":"Vasilakos, Athanasios V"}
