In cases when genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are able to find strong associations between genomic predictors (e.g., SNPs) and disease, pattern recognition methods may be able to predict the disease well. Furthermore, by using signal processing methods, we can capitalize on latent multivariate interactions of genomic predictors. Such an approach to genomic pattern recognition for prediction of clinical outcomes is investigated in this work. In particular, we show how multiresolution transforms can be applied to genomic data to extract cues of multivariate interactions and, in some cases, improve on the predictive performance of clinical outcomes of standard classification methods. Our results show, for example, that an improvement of about 6 percent increase of the area under the ROC curve can be achieved using multiresolution spaces to train logistic regression to predict late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) compared to logistic regression applied directly on SNP data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4826","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4826","fieldValue":"Bioinformatics,Genomics,Signal resolution,Discrete wavelet transforms,Training,Diseases,SNPs.,Human genome,single nucleotide polymorphisms,multiresolution,pattern recognition,wavelets,prediction,clinical outcomes,genomics"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4826","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4826","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4827","fieldValue":"Marteau, Pierre-Francois"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4827","fieldValue":" In the last two decades, a lot of protein 3D shapes have been discovered, characterized, and made available thanks to the Protein Data Bank (PDB), that is nevertheless growing very quickly. New scalable methods are thus urgently required to search through the PDB efficiently. This paper presents an approach entitled LNA (Laplacian Norm Alignment) that performs a structural comparison of two proteins with dynamic programming algorithms. This is achieved by characterizing each residue in the protein with scalar features. The feature values are calculated using a Laplacian operator applied on the graph corresponding to the adjacency matrix of the residues. The weighted Laplacian operator we use estimates, at various scales, local deformations of the topology where each residue is located. On some benchmarks, which are widely shared by the community, we obtain qualitatively similar results compared to other competing approaches, but with an algorithm one or two order of magnitudes faster. 180,000 protein comparisons can be done within 1 second with a single recent Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), which makes our algorithm very scalable and suitable for real-time database querying across the web."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4827","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
