Unfortunately, the approximations based on traditional decompositions, like the singular value and QR decompositions, are not in general sparse. Stewart [(1999), 313--323] has shown how to use a variant of the classical Gram--Schmidt algorithm, called the quasi--Gram-Schmidt--algorithm, to obtain two kinds of low-rank approximations. The first, the SPQR, approximation, is a pivoted, Q-less QR approximation of the form $(XR11^âˆ\u20191$)(R11 R12), where X consists of columns of A. The second, the SCR approximation, is of the form the form A â\u2030\u2026 XTYT, where X and Y consist of columns and rows A and T, is small. In this article we treat the computational details of these algorithms and describe a MATLAB implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19104","fieldValue":"MATLAB"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19104","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19104","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19105","fieldValue":" eigifp is a MATLAB program for computing a few extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the large symmetric generalized eigenvalue problem Ax &equals; Î» Bx. It is a black-box implementation of an inverse free preconditioned Krylov subspace projection method developed by Golub and Ye [2002]. It has important features that allow it to solve some difficult problems without any input from users. It is particularly suitable for problems where preconditioning by the standard shift-and-invert transformation is not feasible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19105","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19105","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19106","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19106","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2849","fieldValue":" This paper presents new approaches to headline generation for English newspaper texts, with an eye toward the production of document surrogates for document selection in cross-language information retrieval. This task is difficult because the user must make decisions about relevance based on (often poor) translations of retrieved documents. To facilitate the decision-making process we need translations that can be assessed rapidly and accurately; our approach is to provide an English headline for the non-English document. We describe two approaches to headline generation and their application to the recent DARPA TIDES-2003 Surprise Language Exercise for Hindi. For comparison, we also implemented an alternative method for surrogate generation: a system that produces topic lists for (Hindi) articles. We present the results of a series of experiments comparing each of these approaches. We demonstrate in both automatic and human evaluations that our linguistically motivated approach outperforms two other surrogate-generation methods: a statistical system and a topic discovery system."}
