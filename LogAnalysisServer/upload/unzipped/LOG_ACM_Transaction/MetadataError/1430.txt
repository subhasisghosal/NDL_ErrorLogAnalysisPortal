Our SwingWrapper approach partitions the surface of an original mesh M into simply connected regions, called triangloids. From these, we generate a new mesh $M^â\u20AC². Each triangle of Mâ\u20AC² is an approximation of a triangloid of M. By construction, the connectivity of Mâ\u20AC² is fairly regular and can be compressed to less than a bit per triangle using EdgeBreaker or one of the other recently developed schemes. The locations of the vertices of Mâ\u20AC² are compactly encoded with our new prediction technique, which uses a single correction parameter per vertex. SwingWrapper strives to reach a user-defined output file size rather than to guarantee a given error bound. For a variety of popular models, a rate of 0.4 bits\/triangle yields an L2$ distortion of about 0.01&percnt; of the bounding box diagonal. The proposed solution may also be used to encode crude meshes for adaptive transmission or for controlling subdivision surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15387","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2458","fieldValue":" We introduce a new feature size for bounded domains in the plane endowed with an intrinsic metric. Given a point x in a domain X, the systolic feature size of X at x measures half the length of the shortest loop through x that is not null-homotopic in X. The resort to an intrinsic metric makes the systolic feature size rather insensitive to the local geometry of the domain, in contrast with its predecessors (local feature size, weak feature size, homology feature size). This reduces the number of samples required to capture the topology of X, provided that a reliable approximation to the intrinsic metric of X is available. Under sufficient sampling conditions involving the systolic feature size, we show that the geodesic Delaunay triangulation $D_x(L) of a finite sampling L is homotopy equivalent to X. Under similar conditions, Dx(L) is sandwiched between the geodesic witness complex $C^WX(L) and a relaxed version CWX,Î½(L). In the conference version of the article, we took advantage of this fact and proved that the homology of Dx(L) (and hence the one of X) can be retrieved by computing the persistent homology between CWX(L) and CWX,Î½(L). Here, we investigate further and show that the homology of X can also be recovered from the persistent homology associated with inclusions of type CWX,Î½(L)&rarrhk;CW$X,Î½â\u20AC²$(L), under some conditions on the parameters Î½â\u2030¤Î½â\u20AC². Similar results are obtained for Vietoris-Rips complexes in the intrinsic metric. The proofs draw some connections with recent advances on the front of homology inference from point cloud data, but also with several well-known concepts of Riemannian (and even metric) geometry. On the algorithmic front, we propose algorithms for estimating the systolic feature size of a bounded planar domain X, selecting a landmark set of sufficient density, and computing the homology of X using geodesic witness complexes or Rips complexes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15388","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15388","fieldValue":" Progressive point set surfaces (PPSS) are a multilevel point-based surface representation. They combine the usability of multilevel scalar displacement maps (e.g., compression, filtering, geometric modeling) with the generality of point-based surface representations (i.e., no fixed homology group or continuity class). The multiscale nature of PPSS fosters the idea of point-based modeling. The basic building block for the construction of PPSS is a projection operator, which maps points in the proximity of the shape onto local polynomial surface approximations. The projection operator allows the computing of displacements from smoother to more detailed levels. Based on the properties of the projection operator we derive an algorithm to construct a base point set. Starting from this base point set, a refinement rule using the projection operator constructs a PPSS from any given manifold surface."}
