Since the SIR on an active link may dip below the SIR target during the transient after a new user enters the cell, Bambos et al. proposed an active link protection algorithm to provide robustness, at the expense of higher energy consumption. This paper examines the tradeoff between energy and robustness. An optimization problem is formulated where robustness is captured in the constraint and the price of robustness penalized in the objective function. A distributed algorithm is developed to solve this problem. Local convergence and optimality of equilibrium are proved for the algorithm. The objective function modulates the tradeoff between energy and robustness, and between energy and speed of admission, as illustrated through a series of numerical experiments. A parameterized family of objective functions is constructed to control the transient and equilibrium properties of robust distributed power control."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9879","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9879","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9879","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9880","fieldValue":" We design a resource allocation algorithm for down-link of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems supporting real-time (RT) and best-effort (BE) services simultaneously over a time-varying wireless channel. The proposed algorithm aims at maximizing system throughput while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements of the RT and BE services. We take two kinds of QoS requirements into account. One is the required average transmission rate for both RT and BE services. The other is the tolerable average absolute deviation of transmission rate (AADTR) just for the RT services, which is used to control the fluctuation in transmission rates and to limit the RT packet delay to a moderate level. We formulate the optimization problem representing the resource allocation under consideration and solve it by using the dual optimization technique and the projection stochastic subgradient method. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm well meets the QoS requirements with the high throughput and outperforms the modified largest weighted delay first (M-LWDF) algorithm that supports similar QoS requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9880","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9880","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9880","fieldValue":"ACM"}
