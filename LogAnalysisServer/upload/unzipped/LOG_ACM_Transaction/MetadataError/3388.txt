{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21078","fieldValue":" There are trade-offs among performance, energy, and device endurance for storage systems. Designs optimized for one dimension or workload often suffer in another. Therefore, it is important to study the trade-offs to enable adaptation to workloads and dimensions. As Flash SSD has emerged, hybrid drives have been studied more closely. However, hybrids are mainly designed for high throughput, efficient energy consumption, or improving enduranceâ\u20AC\u201Dleaving quantitative study on the trade-offs unexplored. Past endurance studies also lack a concrete model to help study the trade-offs. Last, previous designs are often based on inflexible policies that cannot adapt easily to changing conditions. We designed and developed GreenDM, a versatile hybrid drive that combines Flash-based SSDs with traditional HDDs. The SSD can be used as cache or as primary storage for hot data. We present our endurance model together with GreenDM to study these trade-offs. GreenDM presents a block interface and requires no modifications to existing software. GreenDM offers tunable parameters to enable the system to adapt to many workloads. We have designed, developed, and carefully evaluated GreenDM with a variety of workloads using commodity SSD and HDD drives. We demonstrate the importance of versatility to enable adaptation to various workloads and dimensions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21078","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21078","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21079","fieldValue":" Temporal graphs that capture graph changes over time are attracting increasing interest from research communities, for functions such as understanding temporal characteristics of social interactions on a time-evolving social graph. ImmortalGraph is a storage and execution engine designed and optimized specifically for temporal graphs. Locality is at the center of ImmortalGraphâ\u20AC™s design: temporal graphs are carefully laid out in both persistent storage and memory, taking into account data locality in both time and graph-structure dimensions. ImmortalGraph introduces the notion of locality-aware batch scheduling in computation, so that common â\u20ACœbulkâ\u20AC? operations on temporal graphs are scheduled to maximize the benefit of in-memory data locality. The design of ImmortalGraph explores an interesting interplay among locality, parallelism, and incremental computation in supporting common mining tasks on temporal graphs. The result is a high-performance temporal-graph system that is up to 5 times more efficient than existing database solutions for graph queries. The locality optimizations in ImmortalGraph offer up to an order of magnitude speedup for temporal iterative graph mining compared to a straightforward application of existing graph engines on a series of snapshots."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21079","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21079","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21080","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21080","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21081","fieldValue":" We introduce Skylight, a novel methodology that combines software and hardware techniques to reverse engineer key properties of drive-managed Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) drives. The software part of Skylight measures the latency of controlled I\/O operations to infer important properties of drive-managed SMR, including type, structure, and size of the persistent cache; type of cleaning algorithm; type of block mapping; and size of bands. The hardware part of Skylight tracks drive head movements during these tests, using a high-speed camera through an observation window drilled through the cover of the drive. These observations not only confirm inferences from measurements, but resolve ambiguities that arise from the use of latency measurements alone. We show the generality and efficacy of our techniques by running them on top of three emulated and two real SMR drives, discovering valuable performance-relevant details of the behavior of the real SMR drives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21081","fieldValue":"ACM"}
