The measure provides insight into which one of a set of topologies is likely to last the longest before more capacity must be installed. The lifetime measure is not single valued, but considers growth as a function of a set of demand shifts (perturbation). One network may be better able to support a uniform growth in the traffic, while another may support more growth when unexpected shifts in the load occur. The ability of a network to support unexpected changes in load is becoming more important because of: 1) current practices for installing fiber optics cables; 2) recent advances in dense wavelength division multiplexing; and 3) the increasing popularity of the Internet. The lifetime measure is applied to several topologies; a dual ring, a chordal ring, a Manhattan Street network and an hierarchical network. We also apply the measure to a realistic US IP Backbone network. In this paper, our objective is to show how to apply the measure to different networks, and to explain certain implications for comparisons between networks. We expect this measure to be useful both in the construction of new networks and in selecting between new links that may be added to an existing network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9364","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9364","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9364","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9365","fieldValue":" In this paper we introduce an innovation in differentiated services architecture consisting of adaptive two-level coloring at the edge and preferential marking at the core. We identify general properties of these two processes which, when met, guarantee a desirable fixed point for the network; i.e., one where aggregated flow rates meet or exceed given targets in an over-provisioned network. Specific mechanisms realizing the aforementioned properties lead to so-called active rate management controllers for edge coloring, and a preferentially-marking, active queue management controller at the core. We discuss stability of the fixed point for this network, and validate results using ns simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9365","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9365","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9365","fieldValue":"ACM"}
