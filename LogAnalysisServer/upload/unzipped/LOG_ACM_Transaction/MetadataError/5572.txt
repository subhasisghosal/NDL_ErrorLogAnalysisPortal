This problem frequently arises in the classification of data such as types of tumor, gene expression profiles or general biomedical data. It is particularly important in the common context that many units do not properly belong to any cluster. Furthermore, in gene expression data classification, good identification of the most central units in a cluster enables recognition of the most important samples in a particular pathological process. We propose a new depth function that allows us to identify central units. As our approach is based on a measure of distance or dissimilarity between any pair of units, it can be applied to any kind of multivariate data (continuous, binary or multiattribute data). Therefore, it is very valuable in many biomedical applications, which usually involve noncontinuous data, such as clinical, pathological, or biological data sources. We validate the approach using artificial examples and apply it to empirical data. The results show the good performance of our statistical approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4884","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4884","fieldValue":"Kernel,Gaussian distribution,Gene expression,Bioinformatics,Computational biology,Covariance matrix,Context,gene expression data,Cluster analysis,kernel,data depth,depth function,central unit,geometric variability,proximity function"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4884","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4884","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4885","fieldValue":" Given a single index, the receiver operational characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is routinely utilized for characterizing performances in distinguishing two conditions\/groups in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Given the availability of multiple data sources (referred to as multi-indices), such as multimodal neuroimaging data sets, cognitive tests, and clinical ratings and genomic data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies, the single-index-based ROC underutilizes all available information. For a long time, a number of algorithmic\/analytic approaches combining multiple indices have been widely used to simultaneously incorporate multiple sources. In this study, we propose an alternative for combining multiple indices using logical operations, such as \"AND,â\u20AC? \"OR,â\u20AC? and \"at least $(n)$â\u20AC? (where $(n)$ is an integer), to construct multivariate ROC (multiV-ROC) and characterize the sensitivity and specificity statistically associated with the use of multiple indices. With and without the \"leave-one-outâ\u20AC? cross-validation, we used two data sets from AD studies to showcase the potentially increased sensitivity\/specificity of the multiV-ROC in comparison to the single-index ROC and linear discriminant analysis (an analytic way of combining multi-indices). We conclude that, for the data sets we investigated, the proposed multiV-ROC approach is capable of providing a natural and practical alternative with improved classification accuracy as compared to univariate ROC and linear discriminant analysis."}
