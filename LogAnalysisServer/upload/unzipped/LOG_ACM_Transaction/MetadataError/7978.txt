To reduce RF vulnerability, conventional HW-only approaches such as Error Correction Codes (ECCs) or modular redundancies are not suitable due to their significant power overhead. Conversely, SW-only approaches either have limited improvement on RF reliability or require considerable performance overhead. As a result, new approaches are needed that reduce RF vulnerability with minimal power and performance overhead. This article introduces Application-guided Reliability-enhanced Register file Architecture (ARRA), a novel approach to reduce RF vulnerability of embedded processors. Taking advantage of uneven register utilization, ARRA mirrors, guided by a SW instrumentation, frequently used active registers into passive registers. ARRA is particularly suitable for control applications, as they have a high reliability demand with fairly low (uneven) RF utilization. ARRA is a cross-layer joint HW&sol;SW approach based on an ARRA-extended RF microarchitecture, an ISA extension, as well as static binary analysis and instrumentation. We evaluate ARRA benefits using an ARRA-enhanced Blackfin processor executing a set of DSPBench and MiBench benchmarks. We quantify the benefits using RF Vulnerability Factor (RFVF) and Mean Work To Failure (MWTF). ARRA significantly reduces RFVF from 35&percnt; to 6.9&percnt; in cost of 0.5&percnt; performance lost for control applications. With ARRAâ\u20AC™s register mirroring, it can also correct Multiple Bit Upsets (MBUs) errors, achieving an 8x increase in MWTF. Compared to a partially ECC-protected RF approach, ARRA demonstrates higher efficiency by achieving comparable vulnerability reduction at much lower power consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10775","fieldValue":" In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), secondary users (SUs) can flexibly access primary users' (PUs') idle spectrum bands, but such spectrum opportunities are dynamic due to PUs' uncertain activity patterns. In a multihop CRN consisting of SUs as relays, such spectrum dynamics will further cause the invalidity of predetermined routes. In this paper, we investigate spectrum-mobility-incurred route-switching problems in both spatial and frequency domains for CRNs, where spatial switching determines which relays and links should be reselected and frequency switching decides which channels ought to be reassigned to the spatial routes. The proposed route-switching scheme not only avoids conflicts with PUs but also mitigates spectrum congestion. Meanwhile, tradeoffs between routing costs and channel switching costs are achieved. We further formulate the route-switching problem as the Route-Switching Game, which is shown to be a potential game and has a pure Nash equilibrium (NE). Accordingly, efficient algorithms for finding the NE and the Îµ--NE are proposed. Then, we extend the proposed game to the incomplete-information scenario and provide a method to compute the Bayesian NE. Finally, we prove that the price of anarchy of the proposed game has a deterministic upper bound."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10775","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10776","fieldValue":"Puttaswamy, Krishna P N"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10776","fieldValue":" Cloud service providers enable tenants to elastically scale resources to meet their demands. While running cloud applications, a tenant aiming to minimize cost is often challenged with crucial tradeoffs. For instance, upon each arrival of a query, a Web application can either choose to pay for CPU to compute the response fresh, or pay for cache storage to store the response to reduce future compute costs. The Ski-Rental problem abstracts such scenarios where a tenant is faced with a to-rent-or-to-buy tradeoff; in its basic form, a skier should choose between renting or buying a set of skis without knowing the number of days she will be skiing. In the multislope version of the Ski-Rental problem, the skier can choose among multiple services that differ in their buying and renting prices. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the classical Ski-Rental problem in which we assume that the skier knows the first (or second) moment of the distribution of the number of ski days in a season. We also extend the classical multislope Ski-Rental problem, where the skier can choose among multiple services, to this setting. We demonstrate that utilizing this information leads to achieving the best worst-case expected competitive ratio performance. Our method yields a new class of randomized algorithms that provide arrivals-distribution-free performance guarantees. Simulations illustrate that our scheme exhibits robust average-cost performance that combines the best of the well-known deterministic and randomized schemes previously proposed to tackle the Ski-Rental problem."}
