In order to reduce garbage collection overhead, we propose full associative striped block-level mapping. In addition, an adaptive merge is proposed to avoid excessive data block reconstructions during garbage collection. With these mechanisms, the write latency is improved up to 78&percnt; in comparison with the previous multichannel hybrid FTLs in a sample PC trace. The performance improvements stem from 52&percnt; reduced garbage collection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21001","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21002","fieldValue":"Vander Zanden, Bradley T."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21002","fieldValue":" RAID-6 codes protect disk array storage systems from two-disk failures. This article presents a complete treatment of a class of RAID-6 codes, called minimum density RAID-6 codes, that have an optimal blend of performance properties. There are two families of minimal density RAID-6 codes: Blaum-Roth codes and Liberation codes, and a separate special-purpose code called the Liber8tion code. The first of these have been known since the late 1990's, while the latter two are new constructions. In this article, we motivate, demonstrate, and evaluate the minimum density codes, comparing them to EVENODD and RDP codes, which represent the state-of-the-art in RAID-6. Following that, we prove that the codes indeed fit the RAID-6 methodology, and cite their implementation in an open-source library."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21002","fieldValue":"RAID"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21003","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a simple but powerful online availability upgrade mechanism, Supplementary Parity Augmentations(SPA), to address the availability issue in parity-based RAID systems. The basic idea of SPA is to store and update the supplementary parity units on one or a few newly augmented spare disks for online RAID systems in the operational mode, thus achieving the goals of improving the reconstruction performance while tolerating multiple disk failures and latent sector errors simultaneously. By applying the exclusive OR operations appropriately among supplementary parity, full parity, and data units, SPA can reconstruct the data on the failed disks with a fraction of the original overhead that is proportional to the supplementary parity coverage, thus significantly reducing the overhead of data regeneration and decreasing recovery time in parity-based RAID systems. Our extensive trace-driven simulation study shows that SPA can significantly improve the reconstruction performance of the RAID5 and RAID5+0 systems, at an acceptable performance overhead imposed in the operational mode. Moreover, our reliability analytical modeling and sequential Monte-Carlo simulation demonstrate that SPA is consistently more than double the MTTDL of the RAID5 system and improves the reliability of the RAID5+0 system noticeably."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21003","fieldValue":"RAID"}
