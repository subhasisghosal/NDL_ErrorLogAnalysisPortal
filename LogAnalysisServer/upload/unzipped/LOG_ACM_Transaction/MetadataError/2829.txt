The algorithm proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, computations are done in double precision. A forward error analysis and some heuristics are used to obtain an a priori error estimate. This estimate is used in the second stage to compute the fraction to the requested accuracy in high precision (adaptively incrementing the precision for reasons of efficiency). A running error analysis and techniques from interval arithmetic are used to validate the result. As an application, we use this algorithm to compute Gauss and confluent hypergeometric functions when one of the numerator parameters is a positive integer."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19314","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19314","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19315","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a numerical algorithm for efficient and robust solution of a sequence of shifted Hessenberg linear systems. In particular, we show how the frequency response &calG;(σ) = d-C(A-σ $I)^-1$b in the single input case can be computed more efficiently than with other state-of-the-art methods. We also provide a backward stability analysis of the proposed algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19315","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19315","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19316","fieldValue":" We report on careful implementations of seven algorithms for solving the problem of finding a maximum transversal of a sparse matrix. We analyze the algorithms and discuss the design choices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive comparison of maximum transversal algorithms based on augmenting paths. Previous papers with the same objective either do not have all the algorithms discussed in this article or they used nonuniform implementations from different researchers. We use a common base to implement all of the algorithms and compare their relative performance on a wide range of graphs and matrices. We systematize, develop, and use several ideas for enhancing performance. One of these ideas improves the performance of one of the existing algorithms in most cases, sometimes significantly. So much so that we use this as the eighth algorithm in comparisons."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19316","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19316","fieldValue":"ACM"}
