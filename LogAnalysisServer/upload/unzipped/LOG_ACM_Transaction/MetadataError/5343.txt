Such databases are meant to act as repositories for our biological knowledge as we acquire and refine it. Hence, by definition, they are incomplete at any given time. In this paper, we describe a technique that improves our previous method for predicting novel GO annotations by extracting implicit semantic relationships between genes and functions. In this work, we use a vector space model and a number of weighting schemes in addition to our previous latent semantic indexing approach. The technique described here is able to take into consideration the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology (GO) and can weight differently GO terms situated at different depths. The prediction abilities of 15 different weighting schemes are compared and evaluated. Nine such schemes were previously used in other problem domains, while six of them are introduced in this paper. The best weighting scheme was a novel scheme, n2tn. Out of the top 50 functional annotations predicted using this weighting scheme, we found support in the literature for 84 percent of them, while 6 percent of the predictions were contradicted by the existing literature. For the remaining 10 percent, we did not find any relevant publications to confirm or contradict the predictions. The n2tn weighting scheme also outperformed the simple binary scheme used in our previous approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4469","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4469","fieldValue":"Gene function prediction, gene annotation, Gene Ontology, vector space model, latent semantic indexing, weighting schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4469","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4470","fieldValue":" The development of high-throughput technology has generated a massive amount of high-dimensional data, and many of them are of discrete type. Robust and efficient learning algorithms such as LASSO [1] are required for feature selection and overfitting control. However, most feature selection algorithms are only applicable to the continuous data type. In this paper, we propose a novel method for sparse support vector machines (SVMs) with L_{p} (p < 1) regularization. Efficient algorithms (LpSVM) are developed for learning the classifier that is applicable to high-dimensional data sets with both discrete and continuous data types. The regularization parameters are estimated through maximizing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the cross-validation data. Experimental results on protein sequence and SNP data attest to the accuracy, sparsity, and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Biomarkers identified with our methods are compared with those from other methods in the literature. The software package in Matlab is available upon request."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4470","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4470","fieldValue":"Embedded method, feature selection, L_{p} regularization, SVM, SNP data analysis, protease data analysis."}
