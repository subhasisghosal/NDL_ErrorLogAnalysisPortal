A gene team tree is a succinct way to represent all gene teams for every possible value of \\delta. In this paper, improved algorithms are presented for the problem of finding the gene teams of two chromosomes and the problem of constructing a gene team tree of two chromosomes. For the problem of finding gene teams, Béal et al. had an O(n{\\rm lg}^2n)-time algorithm. Our improved algorithm requires O(n{\\rm lg}t) time, where t \\le n is the number of gene teams. For the problem of constructing a gene team tree, Zhang and Leong had an O(n{\\rm lg}^2n)-time algorithm. Our improved algorithm requires O(n{\\rm lg} n{\\rm lglg} n) time. Similar to Béal et al.'s gene team algorithm and Zhang and Leong's gene team tree algorithm, our improved algorithms can be extended to k chromosomes with the time complexities increased only by a factor of k."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4647","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/1361","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"February 2009\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1372\",\"title\":\"Issue 3, February 2009\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"October 2008\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1371\",\"title\":\"Issue 2, October 2008\"},{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"May 2008\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1370\",\"title\":\"Issue 1, May 2008\"}]"}
