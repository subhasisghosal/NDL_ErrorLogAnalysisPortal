{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7988","fieldValue":" Graph clustering, also known as community detection, is a long-standing problem in data mining. In recent years, with the proliferation of rich attribute information available for objects in real-world graphs, how to leverage not only structural but also attribute information for clustering attributed graphs becomes a new challenge. Most existing works took a distance-based approach. They proposed various distance measures to fuse structural and attribute information and then applied standard techniques for graph clustering based on these distance measures. In this article, we take an alternative view and propose a novel Bayesian framework for attributed graph clustering. Our framework provides a general and principled solution to modeling both the structural and the attribute aspects of a graph. It avoids the artificial design of a distance measure in existing methods and, furthermore, can seamlessly handle graphs with different types of edges and vertex attributes. We develop an efficient variational method for graph clustering under this framework and derive two concrete algorithms for clustering unweighted and weighted attributed graphs. Experimental results on large real-world datasets show that our algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art distance-based method, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7988","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7988","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7989","fieldValue":" Community discovery in complex networks is the task of organizing a networkâ\u20AC™s structure by grouping together nodes related to each other. Traditional approaches are based on the assumption that there is a global-level organization in the network. However, in many scenarios, each node is the bearer of complex information and cannot be classified in disjoint clusters. The top-down global view of the partition approach is not designed for this. Here, we represent this complex information as multiple latent labels, and we postulate that edges in the networks are created among nodes carrying similar labels. The latent labels are the communities a node belongs to and we discover them with a simple local-first approach to community discovery. This is achieved by democratically letting each node vote for the communities it sees surrounding it in its limited view of the global system, its ego neighborhood, using a label propagation algorithm, assuming that each node is aware of the label it shares with each of its connections. The local communities are merged hierarchically, unveiling the modular organization of the network at the global level and identifying overlapping groups and groups of groups. We tested this intuition against the state-of-the-art overlapping community discovery and found that our new method advances in the chosen scenarios in the quality of the obtained communities. We perform a test on benchmark and on real-world networks, evaluating the quality of the community coverage by using the extracted communities to predict the metadata attached to the nodes, which we consider external information about the latent labels. We also provide an explanation about why real-world networks contain overlapping communities and how our logic is able to capture them. Finally, we show how our method is deterministic, is incremental, and has a limited time complexity, so that it can be used on real-world scale networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7989","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7989","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7990","fieldValue":" As more and more classification algorithms continue to be developed, recommending appropriate algorithms to a given classification problem is increasingly important. This article first distinguishes the algorithm recommendation methods by two dimensions: (1) meta-features, which are a set of measures used to characterize the learning problems, and (2) meta-target, which represents the relative performance of the classification algorithms on the learning problem. In contrast to the existing algorithm recommendation methods whose meta-target is usually in the form of either the ranking of candidate algorithms or a single algorithm, this article proposes a new and natural multilabel form to describe the meta-target. This is due to the fact that there would be multiple algorithms being appropriate for a given problem in practice. Furthermore, a novel multilabel learning-based generic algorithm recommendation method is proposed, which views the algorithm recommendation as a multilabel learning problem and solves the problem by the mature multilabel learning algorithms. To evaluate the proposed multilabel learning-based recommendation method, extensive experiments with 13 well-known classification algorithms, two kinds of meta-targets such as algorithm ranking and single algorithm, and five different kinds of meta-features are conducted on 1,090 benchmark learning problems. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed multilabel learning-based recommendation method."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/7990","fieldValue":"Multilabel <i>k<\/i> nearest neighbors"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7990","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7990","fieldValue":"ACM"}
