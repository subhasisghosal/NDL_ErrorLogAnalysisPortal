This paper discusses an algorithm for optimizing the single-processor multitask implementation of Simulink models with real-time execution constraints, derived from the sampling rates of the functional blocks. Existing code generation tools enforce the addition of extra buffering and latencies whenever there is a rate transition among functional blocks. This work shows how timing analysis can be used to find the cases in which additional buffering and latency can be avoided, improving the space and time performance of the application. The proposed search algorithm allows finding a solution with reduced and possibly minimal use of buffering even for very high values of processor utilization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6362","fieldValue":" DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) energy consumption in low-power embedded systems can be very high, exceeding that of the data cache or even that of the processor. This paper presents and evaluates a scheme for reducing the energy consumption of SDRAM (synchronous DRAM) memory access by a combination of techniques that take advantage of SDRAM energy efficiencies in bank and row access. This is achieved by using small, cachelike structures in the memory controller to prefetch an additional cache block(s) on SDRAM reads and to combine block writes to the same SDRAM row. The results quantify the SDRAM energy consumption of MiBench applications and demonstrate significant savings in SDRAM energy consumption, 23&percnt;, on average, and reduction in the energy-delay product, 44&percnt;, on average. The approach also improves performance: the CPI is reduced by 26&percnt;, on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6362","fieldValue":"SDRAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6363","fieldValue":" Accurate and fast system modeling is central to the rapid design space exploration needed for embedded-system design. With fast, complex SoCs playing a central role in such systems, system designers have come to require MIPS-range simulation speeds and near-cycle accuracy. The sophisticated simulation frameworks that have been developed for high-speed system performance modeling do not address power consumption, although it is a key design constraint. In this paper, we define a simulation-based methodology for extending system performance modeling frameworks to also include power modeling. We demonstrate the use of this methodology with a case study of a real, complex embedded system, comprising the Intel XScale embedded microprocessor, its WMMX SIMD co processor, L1 caches, SDRAM, and the on-board address and data buses. We describe detailed power models for each of these components and validate them against physical measurements from hardware, demonstrating that such frameworks enable designers to model both power and performance at high speeds without sacrificing accuracy. Our results indicate that the power estimates obtained are accurate within 5&percnt; of physical measurements from hardware, while simulation speeds consistently exceed a million instructions per second (MIPS)."}
