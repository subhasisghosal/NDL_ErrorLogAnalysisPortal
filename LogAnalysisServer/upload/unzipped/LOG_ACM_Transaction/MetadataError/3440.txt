Although near-to-optimal solutions based on Turbo and LDPC codes exist for this problem, in most cases the proposed techniques do not scale to networks of hundreds of sensors. We present a scalable solution based on the following key elements: (a) distortion-optimized index assignments for low-complexity distributed quantization, (b) source-optimized hierarchical clustering based on the Kullback-Leibler distance and (c) sum-product decoding on specific factor graphs exploiting the correlation of the data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21276","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21277","fieldValue":" This tutorial presents a detailed study of sensor faults that occur in deployed sensor networks and a systematic approach to model these faults. We begin by reviewing the fault detection literature for sensor networks. We draw from current literature, our own experience, and data collected from scientific deployments to develop a set of commonly used features useful in detecting and diagnosing sensor faults. We use this feature set to systematically define commonly observed faults, and provide examples of each of these faults from sensor data collected at recent deployments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21277","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21277","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21278","fieldValue":" This article addresses the problem of deploying a sparse network of sensors for surveillance of moving targets. The sensor networks of interest consist of sensors which perform independent binary detection on a target, and report detections to a central node for fusion. An optimization framework is developed for placement of sensors within a bounded search region, given sensor performance characteristics, prior information on anticipated target characteristics, and a distributed detection criteria. Individual sensor performance is represented parametrically as are priors on target dynamics. Several numerical examples are included that illustrate the utility of the optimization approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21278","fieldValue":"ACM"}
