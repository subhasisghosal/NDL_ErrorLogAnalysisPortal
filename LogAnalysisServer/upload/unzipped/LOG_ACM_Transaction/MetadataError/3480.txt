{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3037","fieldValue":" The Malay language has two types of writing script, known as Rumi and Jawi. Most previous stemmer results have reported on Malay Rumi characters and only a few have tested Jawi characters. In this article, a new Jawi stemmer has been proposed and tested for document retrieval. A total of 36 queries and datasets from the transliterated Jawi Quran were used. The experiment shows that the mean average precision for a â\u20ACœstemmed Jawiâ\u20AC? document is 8.43&percnt;. At the same time, the mean average precision for a â\u20ACœnonstemmed Jawiâ\u20AC? document is 5.14&percnt;. The result from a paired sample t-test showed that the use of a â\u20ACœstemmed Jawiâ\u20AC? document increased the precision in document retrieval. Further experiments were performed to examine the precision of the relevant documents that were retrieved at various cutoff points for all 36 queries. The results for the â\u20ACœstemmed Jawiâ\u20AC? document showed a significantly different start, at a cutoff of 40, compared with the â\u20ACœnonstemmed Jawiâ\u20AC? documents. This result shows the usefulness of a Jawi stemmer for retrieving relevant documents in the Jawi script."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3037","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3037","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21379","fieldValue":" We present a new approach to localization of sensors from noisy measurements of a subset of their Euclidean distances. Our algorithm starts by finding, embedding, and aligning uniquely realizable subsets of neighboring sensors called patches. In the noise-free case, each patch agrees with its global positioning up to an unknown rigid motion of translation, rotation, and possibly reflection. The reflections and rotations are estimated using the recently developed eigenvector synchronization algorithm, while the translations are estimated by solving an overdetermined linear system. The algorithm is scalable as the number of nodes increases and can be implemented in a distributed fashion. Extensive numerical experiments show that it compares favorably to other existing algorithms in terms of robustness to noise, sparse connectivity, and running time. While our approach is applicable to higher dimensions, in the current article, we focus on the two-dimensional case."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21379","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21380","fieldValue":" Broadcast is a critical communication primitive in wireless sensor networks. The multihop nature of sensor networks makes it necessary for sensor nodes to forward broadcast messages so that the messages can reach an entire network. Authentication of broadcast messages is an important but challenging problem in sensor networks. Public key cryptography (PKC) has been used recently to address this problem. However, PKC-based authentication techniques are susceptible to bogus packet insertion attacks in which attackers keep broadcasting bogus messages and force resource-constrained sensor nodes to forward such messages. Moreover, because it takes time to do signature verifications, it is impractical for each node to authenticate every received message before forwarding it. In this article, we propose a dynamic window scheme to thwart the aforementioned bogus packet insertion attacks which permits sensor nodes to efficiently broadcast messages. Within this scheme, a sensor node has the ability to determine whether or not to verify an incoming message before forwarding the message. We further study the property of this dynamic window scheme and investigate the best strategy for thwarting bogus packet insertion attacks. We propose three strategies for finding the optimal parameters by an improved additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) window updating function so that the proposed dynamic window scheme can achieve the best overall performance with respect to the authentication and forwarding times of messages. Numerical validations show that our proposed scheme performs very well in terms of energy saving and broadcast delays based on three different metrics, including average authentication delays, the percentage of nodes receiving fake messages, and the percentage of nodes forwarding fake messages."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21380","fieldValue":"AIMD"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21380","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21380","fieldValue":"ACM"}
