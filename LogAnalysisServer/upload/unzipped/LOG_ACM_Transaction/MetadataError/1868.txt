In a realistic viewing condition the perspective applied for rendering should appropriately account for the viewer's location relative to the image. As a result, an observer would not be able to distinguish between a rendering of a virtual environment on a computer screen and a view â\u20ACœthroughâ\u20AC? the screen at an identical real-world scene. Until now, little effort has been made to identify perspective projections which cause human observers to judge them to be realistic. In this article we analyze observers' awareness of perspective distortions of virtual scenes displayed on a computer screen. These distortions warp the virtual scene and make it differ significantly from how the scene would look in reality. We describe psychophysical experiments that explore the subject's ability to discriminate between different perspective projections and identify projections that most closely match an equivalent real scene. We found that the field of view used for perspective rendering should match the actual visual angle of the display to provide users with a realistic view. However, we found that slight changes of the field of view in the range of 10-20&percnt; for two classes of test environments did not cause a distorted mental image of the observed models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2565","fieldValue":"Teng, Shang-Hua"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2565","fieldValue":" Compact routing addresses the tradeoff between table sizes and stretch, which is the worst-case ratio between the length of the path a packet is routed through by the scheme and the length of an actual shortest path from source to destination. We adapt the compact routing scheme by Thorup and Zwick [2001] to optimize it for power-law graphs. We analyze our adapted routing scheme based on the theory of unweighted random power-law graphs with fixed expected degree sequence by Aiello et al. [2000]. Our result is the first analytical bound coupled to the parameter of the power-law graph model for a compact routing scheme. Let n denote the number of nodes in the network. We provide a labeled routing scheme that, after a stretch--5 handshaking step (similar to DNS lookup in TCP\/IP), routes messages along stretch--3 paths. We prove that, instead of routing tables with $Ã\u2022(n^1\/2) bits (Ã\u2022 suppresses factors logarithmic in n) as in the general scheme by Thorup and Zwick, expected sizes of O(nÎ³ log n) bits are sufficient, and that all the routing tables can be constructed at once in expected time O(n1+Î³ log n), with Î³ = Ï\u201E-22\/Ï\u201E-3 + &epsiv;, where Ï\u201Eâˆˆ(2,3) is the power-law exponent and &epsiv; 0 (which implies &epsiv; < Î³ < 1\/3 + &epsiv;). Both bounds also hold with probability at least 1-1\/n (independent of &epsiv;). The routing scheme is a labeled scheme, requiring a stretch--5 handshaking step. The scheme uses addresses and message headers with O(log n log log n) bits, with probability at least 1-o(1). We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme by simulations on real-world graphs as well as synthetic power-law graphs. With the same techniques as for the compact routing scheme, we also adapt the approximate distance oracle by Thorup and Zwick [2001, 2005] for stretch-3 and we obtain a new upper bound of expected Ã\u2022(n1+Î³) for space and preprocessing for random power-law graphs. Our distance oracle is the first one optimized for power-law graphs. Furthermore, we provide a linear-space data structure that can answer 5--approximate distance queries in time at most Ã\u2022(n1\/4+&epsiv;$) (similar to Î³, the exponent actually depends on Ï\u201E and lies between &epsiv; and 1\/4 + &epsiv;)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16511","fieldValue":" We describe a simple algorithm to reconstruct the surface of smooth three-dimensional multilabeled objects from sampled planar cross-sections of arbitrary orientation. The algorithm has the unique ability to handle cross-sections in which regions are classified as being inside the object, outside the object, or unknown. This is achieved by constructing a scalar function on $R^3$, whose zero set is the desired surface. The function is constructed independently inside every cell of the arrangement of the cross-section planes using transfinite interpolation techniques based on barycentric coordinates. These guarantee that the function is smooth, and its zero set interpolates the cross-sections. The algorithm is highly parallelizable and may be implemented as an incremental update as each new cross-section is introduced. This leads to an efficient online version, performed on a GPU, which is suitable for interactive medical applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16511","fieldValue":"ACM"}
