Unfortunately, TCAMs have limitations of small capacity, high power consumption, high heat generation, and high cost. The well-known range expansion problem exacerbates these limitations as each classifier rule typically has to be converted to multiple TCAM rules. One method for coping with these limitations is to use compression schemes to reduce the number of TCAM rules required to represent a classifier. Unfortunately, all existing compression schemes only produce prefix classifiers. Thus, they all miss the compression opportunities created by nonprefix ternary classifiers. In this paper, we propose bit weaving, the first non-prefix compression scheme. Bit weaving is based on the observation that TCAM entries that have the same decision and whose predicates differ by only one bit can be merged into one entry by replacing the bit in question with. Bit weaving consists of two new techniques, bit swapping and bit merging, to first identify and then merge such rules together. The key advantages of bit weaving are that it runs fast, it is effective, and it is composable with other TCAM optimization methods as a pre\/post-processing routine. We implemented bit weaving and conducted experiments on both real-world and synthetic packet classifiers. Our experimental results show the following: 1) bit weaving is an effective standalone compression technique (it achieves an average compression ratio of 23.6%); 2) bit weaving finds compression opportunities that other methods miss. Specifically, bit weaving improves the prior TCAM optimization techniques of TCAM Razor and Topological Transformation by an average of 12.8% and 36.5%, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10290","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10291","fieldValue":" Cognitive radio (CR) technology has great potential to alleviate spectrum scarcity in wireless communications. It allows secondary users (SUs) to opportunistically access spectrum licensed by primary users (PUs) while protecting PU activity. The protection of the PUs is central to the adoption of this technology since no PU would accommodate SU access to its own detriment. In this paper, we consider an SUthat must protectmultiple PUs simultaneously. We focus on the PU packet collision probability as the protection metric. The PUs are unslotted and may have different idle\/busy time distributions and protection requirements. Under general idle time distributions, we determine the form of the SU optimal access policy and identify two special cases for which the computation of the optimal policy is significantly reduced. We also present a simple algorithm to determine these policies using principles of convex optimization theory. We then derive the optimal policy for the same system when an SU has extra \"side information\" on PU activity. We evaluate the performance of these policies through simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10291","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10291","fieldValue":"Opportunistic spectrum access in multiple-primary-user environments under the packet collision constraint"}
