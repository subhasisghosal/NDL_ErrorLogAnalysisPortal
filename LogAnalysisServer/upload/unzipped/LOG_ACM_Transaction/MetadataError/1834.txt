Similar to the original progressive photon mapping algorithm, our approach is capable of computing global illumination solutions without bias in the limit, and it uses only a constant amount of memory. It produces high-quality results in situations that are difficult for most other algorithms, such as scenes with realistic light fixtures where the light sources are completely enclosed by refractive material. Our new formulation is based on a probabilistic derivation. The key property of our approach is that it does not require the maintenance of local photon statistics. In addition, our derivation allows for arbitrary kernels in the radiance estimate and includes stochastic ray tracing algorithms. Finally, our approach is readily applicable to volumetric photon mapping. We compare our algorithm to previous progressive photon mapping approaches and show that we achieve the same convergence to unbiased results, even without local photon statistics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16423","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16423","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16424","fieldValue":" We present the articulated global registration algorithm to reconstruct articulated 3D models from dynamic range scan sequences. This new algorithm aligns multiple range scans simultaneously to reconstruct a full 3D model from the geometry of these scans. Unlike other methods, we express the surface motion in terms of a reduced deformable model and solve for joints and skinning weights. This allows a user to interactively manipulate the reconstructed 3D model to create new animations. We express the global registration as an optimization of both the alignment of the range scans and the articulated structure of the model. We employ a graph-based representation for the skinning weights that successfully handles difficult topological cases well. Joints between parts are estimated automatically and are used in the optimization to preserve the connectivity between parts. The algorithm also robustly handles difficult cases where parts suddenly disappear or reappear in the range scans. The global registration produces a more accurate registration compared to a sequential registration approach, because it estimates the articulated structure based on the motion observed in all input frames. We show that we can automatically reconstruct a variety of articulated models without the use of markers, user-placed correspondences, segmentation, or template model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16424","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16424","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16425","fieldValue":" We present ShadowDraw, a system for guiding the freeform drawing of objects. As the user draws, ShadowDraw dynamically updates a shadow image underlying the user's strokes. The shadows are suggestive of object contours that guide the user as they continue drawing. This paradigm is similar to tracing, with two major differences. First, we do not provide a single image from which the user can trace; rather ShadowDraw automatically blends relevant images from a large database to construct the shadows. Second, the system dynamically adapts to the user's drawings in real-time and produces suggestions accordingly. ShadowDraw works by efficiently matching local edge patches between the query, constructed from the current drawing, and a database of images. A hashing technique enforces both local and global similarity and provides sufficient speed for interactive feedback. Shadows are created by aggregating the edge maps from the best database matches, spatially weighted by their match scores. We test our approach with human subjects and show comparisons between the drawings that were produced with and without the system. The results show that our system produces more realistically proportioned line drawings."}
