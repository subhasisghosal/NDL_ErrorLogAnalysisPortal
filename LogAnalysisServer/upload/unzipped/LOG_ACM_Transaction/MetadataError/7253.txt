One task is to route backup paths and allocate spare capacity in the network to guarantee seamless communications services survivable to a set of failure scenarios. This is a complex multi-constraint optimization problem, called the spare capacity allocation (SCA) problem. This paper unravels the SCA problem structure using a matrix-based model, and develops a fast and efficient approximation algorithm, termed successive survivable routing (SSR). First, per-flow spare capacity sharing is captured by a spare provision matrix (SPM) method. The SPM matrix has a dimension the number of failure scenarios by the number of links. It is used by each demand to route the backup path and share spare capacity with other backup paths. Next, based on a special link metric calculated from SPM, SSR iteratively routes\/updates backup paths in order to minimize the cost of total spare capacity. A backup path can be further updated as long as it is not carrying any traffic. Furthermore, the SPM method and SSR algorithm are generalized from protecting all single link failures to any arbitrary link failures such as those generated by Shared Risk Link Groups or all single node failures. Numerical results comparing several SCA algorithms show that SSR has the best trade-off between solution optimality and computation speed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9324","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8361","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9325","fieldValue":" We present a stochastic traffic engineering framework for optimizing bandwidth provisioning and route selection in networks. The objective is to maximize revenue from serving demands, which are uncertain and specified by probability distributions. We consider heterogenous demands with different unit revenues and uncertainties. Based on mean-risk analysis, the optimization model enables a carrier to maximize mean revenue and contain the risk that the revenue falls below an acceptable level. Our framework is intended for off-line traffic engineering design, which takes a centralized view of network topology, link capacity, and demand. We obtain conditions under which the optimization problem is an instance of convex programming and therefore efficiently solvable. We also study the properties of the solution and show that it asymptotically meets the stochastic efficiency criterion. We derive properties of the optimal solution for the special case of Gaussian distributions of demands. We focus on the impact of demand uncertainty on various aspects of traffic engineering, such as link utilization, bandwidth provisioning and total revenue. The carrier's tolerance to risk is shown to have a strong influence on traffic engineering and revenue management decisions. We develop the efficient frontier, which is the entire set of Pareto optimal pairs of mean revenue and revenue risk, to aid the carrier in selecting an appropriate operating point."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9325","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9325","fieldValue":"ACM"}
