This is driving the need of core networks with a high degree of flexibility and multigranularities to carry traffic. We propose to investigate the question of what this means in terms of dynamic protection provisioning. In other words, we want to study how stable are the protection structures under dynamic traffic, i.e., how much and how often they need to be updated in a dynamic survivable WDM network. While most studies on the stability of protection structures have been conducted on p-cycles and link shared protection, we propose to investigate here the stability of failure-independent path-protecting (FIPP) p-cycles under dynamic traffic. For doing so, we design and develop an original scalable mathematical model that we solve using large-scale optimization tools. Numerical results show that FIPP p-cycles are remarkably stable under the evaluation of the number of required optical bypass reconfigurations under dynamic traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10433","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10433","fieldValue":"Stability of FIPP p-cycles under dynamic traffic in WDM networks: dynamic traffic,failure-independent path-protecting (FIPP) p-cycles,path protection,shared bandwidth protection,stability of protection structures"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10434","fieldValue":" The unlicensed ISM spectrum is getting crowded by wireless local area network (WLAN) and wireless personal area network (WPAN) users and devices. Spectrum sharing within the same network of devices can be arbitrated by existing MAC protocols, but the coexistence between WPAN and WLAN (e.g., ZigBee and WiFi) remains a challenging problem. The traditional MAC protocols are ineffective in dealing with the disparate transmit-power levels, asynchronous time-slots, and incompatible PHY layers of such heterogeneous networks. Recent measurement studies have shown moderate-to-high WiFi traffic to severely impair the performance of coexisting ZigBee. We propose a novel mechanism, called cooperative carrier signaling (CCS), that exploits the inherent cooperation among ZigBee nodes to harmonize their coexistence with WiFi WLANs. CCS employs a separate ZigBee node to emit a carrier signal (busy tone) concurrently with the desired ZigBee's data transmission, thereby enhancing the ZigBee's visibility to WiFi. It employs an innovative way to concurrently schedule a busy tone and a data transmission without causing interference between them. We have implemented and evaluated CCS on the TinyOS\/MICAz and GNURadio\/USRP platforms. Our extensive experimental evaluation has shown that CCS reduces collision between ZigBee and WiFi by 50% for most cases, and by up to 90% in the presence of a high-level interference, all at negligible WiFi performance loss."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10434","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
