Given an event-driven query, social media Web sites usually return a large number of videos that are diverse and noisy in a ranking list. Exploring such results will be time-consuming and thus degrades user experience. This article presents a novel scheme that is able to summarize the content of video search results by mining and threading â\u20ACœkeyâ\u20AC? shots, such that users can get an overview of main content of these videos at a glance. The proposed framework mainly comprises four stages. First, given an event query, a set of Web videos is collected associated with their ranking order and tags. Second, key-shots are established and ranked based on near-duplicate keyframe detection and they are threaded in a chronological order. Third, we analyze the tags associated with key-shots. Irrelevant tags are filtered out via a representativeness and descriptiveness analysis, whereas the remaining tags are propagated among key-shots by random walk. Finally, summarization is formulated as an optimization framework that compromises relevance of key-shots and user-defined skimming ratio. We provide two types of summarization: video skimming and visual-textual storyboard. We conduct user studies on twenty event queries for over hundred hours of videos crawled from YouTube. The evaluation demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25420","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25420","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25421","fieldValue":"Kuo, Wen-Kuang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25421","fieldValue":"Wu, Kuo-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25421","fieldValue":" As the demand for broadband multimedia wireless services is increasing, improving quality of service (QoS) of the widely deployed IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs) has become crucial. To support the QoS required by a wide range of applications, the IEEE 802.11 working group has defined a new standardâ\u20AC\u201Dthe IEEE 802.11e. Substantial studies have been performed on traffic scheduling for variable bit rate (VBR) video transport over 802.11e WLANs. However, within those studies, relatively little attention has been devoted to the QoS transmission of real-time live VBR videos. In this paper, we present a novel traffic scheduling algorithm for IEEE 802.11e that aims at achieving high channel utilization while still guaranteeing QoS requirements for real-time live VBR videos. The novel characteristic of this algorithm, compared to published literatures, is that it predicts the bandwidth requirements for future traffic using a novel traffic predictor designed to provide simple yet accurate online prediction. Analyses using real life MPEG video traces indicate that the proposed traffic predictor significantly outperforms previously published technique with respect to the prediction error. The proposed traffic predictor can also be used independently to estimate any MPEG traffic. The performance of the proposed traffic scheduling algorithm is also investigated by comparing several existing scheduling algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed traffic scheduling algorithm surpasses other mechanisms in terms of channel utilization, buffer usage, video quality and packet loss rate."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25421","fieldValue":"WLAN"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25421","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25421","fieldValue":"ACM"}
