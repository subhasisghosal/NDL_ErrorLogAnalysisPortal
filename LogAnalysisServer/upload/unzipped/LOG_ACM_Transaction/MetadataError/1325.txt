The literature surveyed suggests that the human visual system processes spatial information by means of parallel arrays of neurons that can be modeled by Gabor functions. Based on the Gabor model, it is argued that the fundamental dimensions of texture for human perception are orientation, size (1\/frequency), and contrast. It is shown that there are a number of trade-offs in the density with which information can be displayed using texture. Two of these are (1) a trade-off between the size of the texture elements and the precision with which the location can be specified, and (2) the precision with which texture orientation can be specified and the precision with which texture size can be specified. Two algorithms for generating texture are included."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15111","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15111","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15112","fieldValue":" Solid modeling underlies many technologies that are key to modern manufacturing. These range from CAD systems to robot simulators, from finite-element analysis to integrated circuit process modeling. The accuracy, and hence the utility, of these models is often constrained by the amount of computer time required to perform the desired operations. In this paper we present, in detail, an efficient algorithm for parallel intersections of solids using the Connection Machine, a massively parallel SIMD processor. We describe the data structure for representing the solid models and detail the intersection algorithm, giving special attention to implementation issues. We provide performance results, comparing the parallel algorithm to a serial intersection algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15112","fieldValue":"CAGD"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15112","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2429","fieldValue":" Scheduling on unrelated machines is one of the most general and classical variants of the task scheduling problem. Fractional scheduling is the LP-relaxation of the problem, which is polynomially solvable in the nonstrategic setting, and is a useful tool to design deterministic and randomized approximation algorithms. The mechanism design version of the scheduling problem was introduced by Nisan and Ronen. In this article, we consider the mechanism design version of the fractional variant of this problem. We give lower bounds for any fractional truthful mechanism. Our lower bounds also hold for any (randomized) mechanism for the integral case. In the positive direction, we propose a truthful mechanism that achieves approximation 3\/2 for 2 machines, matching the lower bound. This is the first new tight bound on the approximation ratio of this problem, after the tight bound of 2, for 2 machines, obtained by Nisan and Ronen. For n machines, our mechanism achieves an approximation ratio of n+1\/2. Motivated by the fact that all the known deterministic and randomized mechanisms for the problem assign each task independently from the others, we focus on an interesting subclass of allocation algorithms, the task-independent algorithms. We give a lower bound of n+1\/2, that holds for every (not only monotone) allocation algorithm that takes independent decisions. Under this consideration, our truthful independent mechanism is the best that we can hope from this family of algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2429","fieldValue":"ACM"}
