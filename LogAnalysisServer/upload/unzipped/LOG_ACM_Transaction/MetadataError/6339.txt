A novel approach is presented based on reinforcement learning to predict the best policy amidst existing DPM policies and deterministic markovian nonstationary policies (DMNSP). We apply reinforcement learning, namely a computational approach to understanding and automating goal-directed learning that supports different devices according to their DPM. Reinforcement learning uses a formal framework defining the interaction between agent and environment in terms of states, response action, and reward points. The capability of this approach is demonstrated by an event-driven simulator designed using Java with a power-manageable machine-to-machine device. Our experiment result shows that the proposed dynamic power management with timeout policy gives average power saving from 4&percnt; to 21&percnt; and the novel dynamic power management with DMNSP gives average power saving from 10&percnt; to 28&percnt; more than already proposed DPM policies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6864","fieldValue":" In the development of real-time embedded applications, especially those on systems-on-chip, an efficient use of RAM memory is as important as the effective scheduling of the computation resources. The protection of communication and state variables accessed by concurrent tasks must provide real-time schedulability guarantees while using the least amount of memory. Several schemes, including preemption thresholds, have been developed to improve schedulability and save stack space by selectively disabling preemption. However, the design synthesis problem is still open. In this article, we target the assignment of the scheduling parameters to minimize memory usage for systems of practical interest, including designs compliant with automotive standards. We propose algorithms either proven optimal or shown to improve on randomized optimization methods like simulated annealing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6865","fieldValue":" Caches are known to consume a large part of total microprocessor energy. Traditionally, voltage scaling has been used to reduce both dynamic and leakage power in caches. However, aggressive voltage reduction causes process-variation-induced failures in cache SRAM arrays, thus compromising cache reliability. We present MultiCopy Cache $(MC^2), a new cache architecture that achieves significant reduction in energy consumption through aggressive voltage scaling while maintaining high error resilience (reliability) by exploiting multiple copies of each data item in the cache. Unlike many previous approaches, MC2 does not require any error map characterization and therefore is responsive to changing operating conditions (e.g., Vdd noise, temperature, and leakage) of the cache. MC2 also incurs significantly lower overheads compared to other ECC-based caches. Our experimental results on embedded benchmarks demonstrate that MC2$ achieves up to 60&percnt; reduction in energy and energy-delay product (EDP) with only 3.5&percnt; reduction in IPC and no appreciable area overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6865","fieldValue":"ACM"}
