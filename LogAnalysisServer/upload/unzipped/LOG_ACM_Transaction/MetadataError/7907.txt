This particularly hinders the usage of FDP in all-optical mesh networks. As a remedy, this paper investigates a new restoration framework that enables all-optical fault management and device configuration via state-of-the-art failure localization techniques, such as the FDP restoration process. It can be implemented without relying on any control plane signaling. With the proposed restoration framework, a novel spare capacity allocation problem is defined and is further analyzed on circulant topologies for any single link failure, aiming to gain a solid understanding of the problem. By allowing reuse of monitoring resources for restoration capacity, we are particularly interested in the monitoring resource hidden property, where less or even no monitoring resources are consumed as more working traffic is in place. To deal with general topologies, we introduce a novel heuristic approach to the proposed spare capacity allocation problem, which comprises a generic FDP survivable routing scheme followed by a novel monitoring resource allocation method. Extensive simulation is conducted to examine the proposed scheme and verify the proposed restoration framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10628","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10628","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10628","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10629","fieldValue":" Radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies are poised to revolutionize retail, warehouse, and supply chain management. One of their interesting applications is to automatically detect missing tags in a large storage space, which may have to be performed frequently to catch any missing event such as theft in time. Because RFID systems typically work under low-rate channels, past research has focused on reducing execution time of a detection protocol to prevent excessively long protocol execution from interfering normal inventory operations. However, when active tags are used for a large spatial coverage, energy efficiency becomes critical in prolonging the lifetime of these battery-powered tags. Furthermore, much of the existing literature assumes that the channel between a reader and tags is reliable, which is not always true in reality because of noise\/interference in the environment. Given these concerns, this paper makes three contributions. First, we propose a novel protocol design that considers both energy efficiency and time efficiency. It achieves multifold reduction in both energy cost and execution time when compared to the best existing work. Second, we reveal a fundamental energy-time tradeoff in missing-tag detection, which can be flexibly controlled through a couple of system parameters in order to achieve desirable performance. Third, we extend our protocol design to consider channel error under two different models. We find that energy\/time cost will be higher in unreliable channel conditions, but the energy-time tradeoff relation persists."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10629","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10629","fieldValue":"ACM"}
