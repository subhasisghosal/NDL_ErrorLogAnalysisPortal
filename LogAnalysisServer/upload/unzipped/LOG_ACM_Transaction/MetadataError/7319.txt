The source's transmission is subjected to quasi-static flat Rayleigh fading, while the transmission of the relay experiences a fixed amplitude gain with a uniform random phase, capturing its close proximity to the destination. All communications share the same time\/bandwith resources, and perfect channel state information is known only to the receivers. We propose relaying protocols which are based on Wyner-Ziv quantization at the relay, and demonstrate their high efficiency (in terms of expected throughput) with respect to previously reported relaying schemes based on amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward. A salient feature of these protocols is that the relay need not know the actual fading gain experienced by the destination in order to perform the quantization. We also consider a hybrid amplify-quantize-decode-and-forward scheme which exhibits superior performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9456","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9456","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9456","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9456","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9457","fieldValue":"Harvey, Nicholas J A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9457","fieldValue":" An outer bound on the rate region of noise-free information networks is given. This outer bound combines properties of entropy with a strong information inequality derived from the structure of the network. This blend of information theoretic and graph theoretic arguments generates many interesting results. For example, the capacity of directed cycles is characterized. Also, a gap between the sparsity of an undirected graph and its capacity is shown. Extending this result, it is shown that multicommodity flow solutions achieve the capacity in an infinite class of undirected graphs, thereby making progress on a conjecture of Li and Li. This result is in sharp contrast to the situation with directed graphs, where a family of graphs is presented in which the gap between the capacity and the rate achievable using multicommodity flows is linear in the size of the graph."}
