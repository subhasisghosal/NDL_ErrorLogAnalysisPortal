For economical reasons, it would be highly desirable that a single switch fabric could accommodate the needs of a variety of heterogeneous services and applications from both domains. In this paper, we consider the current requirements, technological trends, and their implications on the design of an ASIC chipset for a merchant switch fabric. We then identify the architecture upon which such a suitable and generic switch fabric could be based, and we present the general characteristics of an implementation of this switching fabric within the bounds of current state-of-the-art technology. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to design a chipset that can be used for both communications and computer interconnection networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9695","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9696","fieldValue":" In this Comment, two typos in Ho et al., 2004, \"Segment Shared Protection in Mesh Communication Networks With Bandwidth Guaranteed Tunnels\", are pointed out.
