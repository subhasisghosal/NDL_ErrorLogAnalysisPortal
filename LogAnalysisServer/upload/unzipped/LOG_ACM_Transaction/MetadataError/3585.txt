{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21633","fieldValue":" Energy efficiency is one of the most critical issues in the design and deployment of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Data compression is an important approach to reducing energy consumption of data gathering in multihop sensor networks. Existing compression algorithms only apply to either lossless or lossy data compression, but not to both. This article presents a generalized predictive coding framework for unified lossless and lossy data compression. In addition, we devise a novel algorithm for lossless compression to significantly improve data compression performance for various data collections and applications in WSNs. Rigorous simulations show our proposed framework and compression algorithm outperform several recent popular compression algorithms for WSNs such as Lossless Entropy Compression (LEC), S-Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), and Lightweight Temporal Compression (LTC) using various real-world sensor datasets, demonstrating the merit of the proposed framework for unified temporal lossless and lossy data compression in WSNs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21633","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21633","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21634","fieldValue":" Resource constraints, unattended operating environments, and communication phenomena make Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) susceptible to operational failures and security attacks. However, applications often impose stringent requirements on data reliability and service availability, due to the deployment of sensor networks in various critical infrastructures. Given the failure- and attack-prone nature of sensor networks, enabling sensor networks to continuously provide their services as well as to effectively recover from attacks is a crucial requirement. We present Kinesis, a security incident response system designed to keep WSNs functional despite anomalies or attacks and to recover from attacks without significant interruption. Kinesis is quick and effective in responding to incidents, distributed in nature, dynamic in selecting response actions based on the context, and lightweight in terms of response policy specification, communication, and energy overhead. A per-node single timer-based distributed strategy to select the most effective response executor in a neighborhood makes the system simple and scalable, while achieving load balancing and redundant action optimization. We implement Kinesis in TinyOS and measure its performance for various application and network layer incidents. Extensive TOSSIM simulations and testbed experiments show that Kinesis successfully counteracts anomalies\/attacks and behaves consistently under various attack scenarios and rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21634","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21634","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21635","fieldValue":" Recent advances in smartphone processing power have opened the possibilities for them to act as the processing component of software-defined radios (SDRs). For low-power sensor network systems using various communication protocols, this means that smartphones, when equipped with an SDR, can be their system management end-devices, (potentially) without the need for external communication modules. Nevertheless, the high processor and energy usage overhead of SDRs remains a major technical barrier that blocks the practical adoption of smartphone-based SDRs. In this work, we show that implementation flexibility at the software can relax this overhead. Specifically, we show, using an implementation of the low-power listening (LPL) Medium Access Control (MAC), that software improvements have the potential to significantly reduce the operational overhead of SDRs. Moreover, we show that implementing packet reception filters can help further reduce the performance overhead without sacrificing application-level message exchange qualities. Empirical results with a smartphone-based SDR suggest that by combining LPL with packet reception filters, the processing and energy overhead can be reduced by two to three orders of magnitude. We not only see this as a chance to practically realize smartphones as a wireless sensing system controller but also believe that the experiences with practical smartphone-based SDRs can provide guidelines for future wireless protocol and low-power radio designs that are suitable for mobile computing environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21635","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21635","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21636","fieldValue":"Cheong, Se-Hang"}
