Unfortunately, deep submicron CMOS process technology is marred by increasing susceptibility to wear. Prolonged operational stress gives rise to accelerated wearout and failure due to several physical failure mechanisms, including hot-carrier injection (HCI) and negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI). Each failure mechanism correlates with different usage-based stresses, all of which can eventually generate permanent faults. While the wearout of an individual core in many-core CMPs may not necessarily be catastrophic, a single fault in the interprocessor network-on-chip (NoC) fabric could render the entire chip useless, as it could lead to protocol-level deadlocks, or even partition away vital components such as the memory controller or other critical I\/O. In this article, we study HCI- and NBTI-induced wear due to actual stresses caused by real workloads, applied onto the interconnect microarchitecture and develop a critical path model for NBTI-induced wearout. A key finding of this modeling is that, counter to prevailing wisdom, wearout in the CMP's on-chip interconnect is correlated with lack of load observed in the NoC routers rather than high load. We then develop a novel wearout-decelerating scheme in which routers under low load have their wear-sensitive components exercised without significantly impacting cycle time, pipeline depth, area, or power consumption of the overall router. A novel deterministic approach is proposed for the generation of appropriate exercise-mode data, ensuring design parameter targets are met. We subsequently show that the proposed design yields an âˆ¼2,300Ã\u2014 decrease in the rate of wear."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13450","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13450","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13451","fieldValue":"Pineda De Gyvez, Jose"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13451","fieldValue":" Resilient design techniques are used to (i) ensure correct operation under dynamic variations and to (ii) improve design performance (e.g., timing speculation). However, significant overheads (e.g., 16&percnt; and 14&percnt; energy penalties due to throughput degradation and additional circuits) are incurred by existing resilient design techniques. For instance, resilient designs require additional circuits to detect and correct timing errors. Further, when there is an error, the additional cycles needed to restore a previous correct state degrade throughput, which diminishes the performance benefit of using resilient designs. In this work, we describe an improved methodology for resilient design implementation to minimize the costs of resilience in terms of power, area, and throughput degradation. Our methodology uses two levers: selective-endpoint optimization (i.e., sensitivity-based margin insertion) and clock skew optimization. We integrate the two optimization techniques in an iterative optimization flow which comprehends toggle rate information and the trade-off between cost of resilience and margin on combinational paths. Since the error-detection network can result in up to 9&percnt; additional wirelength cost, we also propose a matching-based algorithm for construction of the error-detection network to minimize this resilience overhead. Further, our implementations comprehend the impacts of signoff corners (in particular, hold constraints, and use of typical vs. slow libraries) and process variation, which are typically omitted in previous studies of resilience trade-offs. Our proposed flow achieves energy reductions of up to 21&percnt; and 10&percnt; compared to a conventional (with only margin used to attain robustness) design and a brute-force implementation (i.e., a typical resilient design, where resilient endpoints are (greedily) instantiated at timing-critical endpoints), respectively. We show that these benefits increase in the context of an adaptive voltage scaling strategy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13451","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13451","fieldValue":"ACM"}
