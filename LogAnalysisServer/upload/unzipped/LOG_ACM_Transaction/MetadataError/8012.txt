Netflix alone accounts for 29.7% of the peak downstream traffic in the US in 2011. Understanding the system architectures and performance of Netflix and Hulu can shed light on the design of such large-scale video streaming platforms, and help improving the design of future systems. In this paper, we perform extensive measurement study to uncover their architectures and service strategies. Netflix and Hulu bear many similarities. Both Netflix and Hulu video streaming platforms rely heavily on the third-party infrastructures, with Netflix migrating that majority of its functions to the Amazon cloud, while Hulu hosts its services out of Akamai. Both service providers employ the same set of three content distribution networks (CDNs) in delivering the video contents. Using active measurement study, we dissect several key aspects of OTT streaming platforms of Netflix and Hulu, e.g., employed streaming protocols, CDN selection strategy, user experience reporting, etc. We discover that both platforms assign the CDN to a video request without considering the network conditions and optimizing the user-perceived video quality. We further conduct the performance measurement studies of the three CDNs employed by Netflix and Hulu. We show that the available bandwidths on all three CDNs vary significantly over the time and over the geographic locations. We propose a measurement-based adaptive CDN selection strategy and a multiple-CDN-based video delivery strategy that can significantly increase users' average available bandwidth."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10844","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10844","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10844","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10845","fieldValue":" Contention among users utilizing a single shared resource arises in multiple contexts of computing and computer communications. We consider a setup in which users can split their work between a shared resource and a private resource. Unlike the private resource, which provides guaranteed performance, the performance of the shared resource is highly dependent on the usage pattern of other users, which in turn influences a user's decision if and to what extent to make use of the shared resource. The intrinsic relation between the utility that a user perceives from the shared resource and the usage pattern followed by other users gives rise to a noncooperative game, which we model and investigate. We show that the considered game admits a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, we show that this equilibrium is unique. We investigate the ratio between the worst Nash equilibrium and the social optimum, known as the \"price of anarchy,\" and show that, while in some cases of interest the Nash equilibrium coincides with a social optimum, in other cases the price of anarchy can be arbitrarily large. We demonstrate that, somewhat counterintuitively, exercising admission control to the shared resource may deteriorate its performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that certain (heavy) users may \"scare off\" other, potentially large, communities of users. Accordingly, we propose a resource allocation scheme that addresses this problem and opens the shared resource to a wide range of user types."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10845","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10845","fieldValue":"ACM"}
