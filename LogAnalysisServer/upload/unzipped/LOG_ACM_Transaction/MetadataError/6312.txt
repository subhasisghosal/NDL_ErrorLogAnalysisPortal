We, first, study the performance, power, area and scalability properties of general adders. Next, suitable error-detection schemes for low-power embedded systems are discussed. As a result, our ScAUs are enhanced with a suitable error-detection scheme, resulting in a Parity-Checked ScAU (PCScAU) design. The PCScAU strikes a flexible trade-off between space and time redundancy, offering dependability similar to high-end techniques for the area and power cost of low-end approaches. An alternative design, the Precision-Scalable Arithmetic Unit (PScAU) maintains throughput with degraded precision in case of hardware failures. The PScAU is targeting dependable applications where latency rather than numerical accuracy is more important. The PScAU's downscaled mode is also interesting for runtime thermal management due to its advantageous power consumption. We implemented and synthesized the PCScAU, PScAU and a few important reference designs (double-, triple- and quadruple-modular-redundancy adders with\/without input gating) in 90-nm UMC technology. Overall, the PC-ScAU ranks first in 9 out of 10 power-delay-area (PDA)-product variants. It exhibits 16&percnt; area savings and 12&percnt; performance speedup for 7&percnt; increase in total power consumption, compared to the cheapest form of conventional hardware replication with the same fault coverage. The PDA product of the PCScAU is, thus, reduced by 21&percnt;. It is interesting that, while total power slightly increases, the PCScAU static power in fact decreases by 14&percnt;. Therefore, for newer technology nodes where the static power component is significant, the PCScAU can also achieveâ\u20AC\u201Dnext to performance and area -- significant power improvements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6796","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6796","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6797","fieldValue":"Park, Ki-Woong"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6797","fieldValue":" Phase Change RAM (PRAM) is a candidate to replace DRAM main memory due to its low idle power consumption and high scalability. However, its latency and endurance have generated problems in fulfilling its main memory role. The latency can be treated with a DRAM buffer, but the endurance problem remains, with three critical points that need to be improved despite the use of, existing wear-leveling algorithms. First, existing DRAM buffering schemes do not consider write count distribution. Second, swapping and shifting operations are performed statically. Finally, swapping and shifting operations are loosely coupled with a DRAM buffer. As a remedy to these drawbacks, we propose an adaptive wear-leveling algorithm that consists of three novel schemes for PRAM main memory with a DRAM buffer. The PRAM-aware DRAM buffering scheme reduces the write count and prevents skewed writing by considering the write count and clean data based on the least recently used (LRU) scheme. The adaptive multiple swapping and shifting scheme makes the write count even with the dynamic operation timing, the number of swapping pages being based on the workload pattern. Our DRAM buffer-aware swapping and shifting scheme reduces overhead by curbing additional swapping and shifting operations, thus reducing unnecessary write operations. To evaluate the wear-leveling effect, we have implemented a PIN-based wear-leveling simulator. The evaluation confirms that the PRAM lifetime increases from 0.68 years with the previous wear-leveling algorithm to 5.32 years with the adaptive wear-leveling algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6797","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6797","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6798","fieldValue":" In this article implementation of carrier frequency offset estimate for 20MHz LTE baseband processing is discussed. LTE (Long Term Evolution) is a wireless communication standard that makes use of some innovative techniques to gain very high data rates (>100Mbps). This goal for such a high throughput also imposes design challenges for the industry and academia such as in the case of handheld mobile devices where the power budget is very limited. Implicitly high throughput means we need more computation power and more energy. On the other hand industry is also struggling for a flexible hardware solution, or software defined a radio (SDR), to amortize the huge cost of required hardware changes as the wireless standards have kept evolving. Design innovations are now needed to confront those challenges of low power and flexible design without changing the hardware. The implementation is made on Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA), which is a unique concept in computer architecture design, based on the single instruction, â\u20ACœMOVEâ\u20AC?. The power consumption of the architecture when synthesized on 180nm technology at 180MHz and 1.8V is 18.39mW. The total area occupied excluding memory is $0.6mm^2$. The proposed TTA solution has been compared with, a more ASIC (application specific integrated circuits), like ASIP (application specific instruction processor) solution and a coprocessor accelerator-based solution. The proposed solution is more flexible: easily programmable due to high level language support, easily scalable, and still efficient in energy consumption needed to complete the CFO (carrier frequency offset) estimation task. Because of these attractive characteristics, TTA is also a potential candidate for SDR platforms."}
