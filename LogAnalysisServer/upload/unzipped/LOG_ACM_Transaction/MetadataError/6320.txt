{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6814","fieldValue":" Advances in technology scaling increasingly make emerging Chip MultiProcessor (CMP) platforms more susceptible to failures that cause various reliability challenges. In such platforms, error-prone on-chip memories (caches) continue to dominate the chip area. Also, Network-on-Chip (NoC) fabrics are increasingly used to manage the scalability of these architectures. We present a novel solution for efficient implementation of fault-tolerant design of Last-Level Cache (LLC) in CMP architectures. The proposed approach leverages the interconnection network fabric to protect the LLC cache banks against permanent faults in an efficient and scalable way. During an LLC access to a faulty block, the network detects and corrects the faults, returning the fault-free data to the requesting core. Leveraging the NoC interconnection fabric, designers can implement any cache fault-tolerant scheme in an efficient, modular, and scalable manner for emerging multicore\/manycore platforms. We propose four different policies for implementing a remapping-based fault-tolerant scheme leveraging the NoC fabric in different settings. The proposed policies enable design trade-offs between NoC traffic (packets sent through the network) and the intrinsic parallelism of these communication mechanisms, allowing designers to tune the system based on design constraints. We perform an extensive design space exploration on NoC benchmarks to demonstrate the usability and efficacy of our approach. In addition, we perform sensitivity analysis to observe the behavior of various policies in reaction to improvements in the NoC architecture. The overheads of leveraging the NoC fabric are minimal: on an 8-core, 16-cache-bank CMP we demonstrate reliable access to LLCs with additional overheads of less than 3&percnt; in area and less than 7&percnt; in power."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6814","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6814","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6815","fieldValue":" With increasing application complexity and improvements in process technology, Chip MultiProcessors (CMPs) with tens to hundreds of cores on a chip are becoming a reality. Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) have emerged as scalable communication fabrics that can support high bandwidths for these massively parallel multicore systems. However, traditional electrical NoC implementations still need to overcome the challenges of high data transfer latencies and large power consumption. On-chip photonic interconnects with high performance-per-watt characteristics have recently been proposed as an alternative to address these challenges for intra-chip communication. In this article, we explore using low-cost photonic interconnects on a chip to enhance traditional electrical NoCs. Our proposed hybrid photonic ring-mesh NoC (METEOR) utilizes a configurable photonic ring waveguide coupled to a traditional 2D electrical mesh NoC. Experimental results indicate a strong motivation to consider the proposed architecture for future CMPs, as it can provide about 5Ã\u2014 reduction in power consumption and improved throughput and access latencies, compared to traditional electrical 2D mesh and torus NoC architectures. Compared to other previously proposed hybrid photonic NoC fabrics such as the hybrid photonic torus, Corona, and Firefly, our proposed fabric is also shown to have lower photonic area overhead, power consumption, and energy-delay product, while maintaining competitive throughput and latency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6815","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6815","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6816","fieldValue":" Improvements in semiconductor nanotechnology made chip multiprocessors the reference architecture for high-performance microprocessors. CMPs usually adopt large Last-Level Caches (LLC) shared among cores and private L1 caches, whose performances depend on the wire-delay dominated response time of LLC. NUCA (NonUniform Cache Architecture) caches represent a viable solution for tolerating wire-delay effects. In this article, we present Re-NUCA, a NUCA cache that exploits replication of blocks inside the LLC to avoid performance limitations of D-NUCA caches due to conflicting access to shared data. Results show that a Re-NUCA LLC permits to improve performances of more than 5&percnt; on average, and up to 15&percnt; for applications that strongly suffer from conflicting access to shared data, while reducing network traffic and power consumption with respect to D-NUCA caches. Besides, it outperforms different S-NUCA schemes optimized with victim replication."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6816","fieldValue":"NUCA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6816","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6816","fieldValue":"ACM"}
