The performance of the system optimization and monitoring schemes can be improved by spending resources such as time or bandwidth in observing or resolving the values of these parameters. In a resource-constrained situation, deciding which parameters to observe in order to best optimize the expected system performance (or in general, optimize the expected value of a certain objective function) itself becomes an interesting optimization problem. In this article, we initiate the study of such problems that we term â\u20ACœmodel-driven optimizationâ\u20AC?. In particular, we study the problem of optimizing the minimum value in the presence of observable distributions. We show that this problem is NP-Hard, and present greedy algorithms with good performance bounds. The proof of the performance bounds are via novel sub-modularity arguments and connections to covering integer programs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2475","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2475","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15561","fieldValue":" We present a technique for capturing time-varying volumetric data of participating media. A laser sheet is swept repeatedly through the volume, and the scattered light is imaged using a high-speed camera. Each sweep of the laser provides a near-simultaneous volume of density values. We demonstrate rendered animations under changing viewpoint and illumination, making use of measured values for the scattering phase function and albedo."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15562","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15562","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose a novel image-based approach to model hair geometry from images taken at multiple viewpoints. Unlike previous hair modeling techniques that require intensive user interactions or rely on special capturing setup under controlled illumination conditions, we use a handheld camera to capture hair images under uncontrolled illumination conditions. Our multi-view approach is natural and flexible for capturing. It also provides inherent strong and accurate geometric constraints to recover hair models.In our approach, the hair fibers are synthesized from local image orientations. Each synthesized fiber segment is validated and optimally triangulated from all visible views. The hair volume and the visibility of synthesized fibers can also be reliably estimated from multiple views. Flexibility of acquisition, little user interaction, and high quality results of recovered complex hair models are the key advantages of our method."}
