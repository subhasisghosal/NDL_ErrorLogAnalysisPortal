These probabilities arise in many applications including in PERT networks where our interest may be in measuring the probability of large project delays. We also develop provably asymptotically optimal importance sampling techniques to efficiently estimate these probabilities. In the light-tailed settings we show that an appropriate mixture of exponentially twisted distributions efficiently estimates these probabilities. As is well known, exponential twisting based methods are not applicable in the heavy-tailed settings. To remedy this, we develop techniques that rely on â\u20ACœasymptotic hazard rate twistingâ\u20AC? and prove their effectiveness in both light and heavy-tailed settings. We show that in many cases the latter may have implementation advantages over exponential twisting based methods in the light-tailed settings. However, our experiments suggest that when easily implementable, the exponential twisting based methods significantly outperform asymptotic hazard rate twisting based methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24939","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24939","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24940","fieldValue":" We propose nonstandard simulation estimators of expected time averages over finite intervals &lsqb;0, t&rsqb;, seeking to enhance estimation efficiency. We make three key assumptions: (i) the underlying stochastic process has regenerative structure, (ii) the time average approaches a known limit as time t increases and (iii) time 0 is a regeneration time. To exploit those properties, we propose a residual-cycle estimator, based on data from the regenerative cycle in progress at time t, using only the data after time t. We prove that the residual-cycle estimator is unbiased and more efficient than the standard estimator for all sufficiently large t. Since the relative efficiency increases in t, the method is ideally suited to use when applying simulation to study the rate of convergence to the known limit. We also consider two other simulation techniques to be used with the residual-cycle estimator. The first involves overlapping cycles, paralleling the technique of overlapping batch means in steady-state estimation; multiple observations are taken from each replication, starting a new observation each time the initial regenerative state is revisited. The other technique is splitting, which involves independent replications of the terminal period after time t, for each simulation up to time t. We demonstrate that these alternative estimators provide efficiency improvement by conducting simulations of queueing models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24940","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24940","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24941","fieldValue":"LEcuyer, Pierre"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24941","fieldValue":" In the context of rare-event simulation, splitting and importance sampling (IS) are the primary approaches to make important rare events happen more frequently in a simulation and yet recover an unbiased estimator of the target performance measure, with much smaller variance than a straightforward Monte Carlo (MC) estimator. Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) is another class of methods for reducing the noise of simulation estimators, by sampling more evenly than with standard MC. It typically works well for simulations that depend mostly on very few random numbers. In splitting and IS, on the other hand, we often simulate Markov chains whose sample paths are a function of a long sequence of independent random numbers generated during the simulation. In this article, we show that RQMC can be used jointly with splitting and\/or IS to construct better estimators than those obtained by either of these methods alone. We do that in a setting where the goal is to estimate the probability of reaching B before reaching (or returning to) A when starting A from a distinguished state not in B, where A and B are two disjoint subsets of the state space, and B is very rarely reached. This problem has several practical applications. The article is in fact a two-in-one: the first part provides a guided tour of splitting techniques, introducing along the way some improvements in the implementation of multilevel splitting. At the end of the article, we also give examples of situations where splitting is not effective. For these examples, we compare different ways of applying IS and combining it with RQMC."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24941","fieldValue":"RESTART"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24941","fieldValue":"ACM"}
