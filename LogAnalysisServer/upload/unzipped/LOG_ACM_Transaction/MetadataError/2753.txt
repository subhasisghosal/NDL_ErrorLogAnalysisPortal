This special issue is devoted to temporal information processing for natural language as well as temporal reasoning. We begin by describing some of the ways time is expressed in natural language, and the particular requirements this imposes on information processing systems. We then provide an overview of current annotation-based approaches to temporal information extraction, followed by an introduction to the relevant literature on temporal reasoning. We also provide brief synopses of the articles in this issue, situating them in a broader context. We end with administrative remarks about the creation of this special issue."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2852","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2852","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19143","fieldValue":" As a key step towards a complete automation of the finite element method, we present a new algorithm for automatic and efficient evaluation of multilinear variational forms. The algorithm has been implemented in the form of a compiler, the FEniCS Form Compiler (FFC). We present benchmark results for a series of standard variational forms, including the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations and linear elasticity. The speedup compared to the standard quadrature-based approach is impressive; in some cases the speedup is as large as a factor of 1000."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19143","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19143","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19144","fieldValue":" We present a new out-of-core sparse symmetric-indefinite factorization algorithm. The most significant innovation of the new algorithm is a dynamic partitioning method for the sparse factor. This partitioning method results in very low I\/O traffic and allows the algorithm to run at high computational rates, even though the factor is stored on a slow disk. Our implementation of the new code compares well with both high-performance in-core sparse symmetric-indefinite codes and a high-performance out-of-core sparse Cholesky code."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19145","fieldValue":" A continued fraction function algorithm is developed to evaluate general-order Mathieu characteristic numbers, and a new technique is presented for evaluating the Mathieu determinant which can be used to compute the order directly.

The algorithms, with minor modifications, were used for computing Mathieu coefficients of general order. The algorithms can deal with a large range of Mathieu characteristic number c, real and complex order Î½, and parameter h."}
