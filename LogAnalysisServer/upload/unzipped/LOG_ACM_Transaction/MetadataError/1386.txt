{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15271","fieldValue":" Rendering performance of consumer graphics hardware benefits from pre-processing geometric data into a form targeted to the underlying API and hardware. The various elements of geometric data are then coupled with a shading program at runtime to draw the asset.In this paper we describe a system in which pre-processing is done in a compilation process in which the geometric data are processed with knowledge of their shading programs. The data are converted into structures targeted directly to the hardware, and a code stream is assembled that describes the manipulations required to render these data structures. Our compiler is structured like a traditional code compiler, with a front end that reads the geometric data and attributes (hereafter referred to as an art asset) output from a 3D modeling package and shaders in a platform independent form and performs platform-independent optimizations, and a back end that performs platform-specific optimizations and generates platform-targeted data structures and code streams.Our compiler back-end has been targeted to four platforms, three of which are radically different from one another. On all platforms the rendering performance of our compiled assets, used in real situations, is well above that of hand-coded assets."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15272","fieldValue":" We present a physically based method for modeling and animating fire. Our method is suitable for both smooth (laminar) and turbulent flames, and it can be used to animate the burning of either solid or gas fuels. We use the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to independently model both vaporized fuel and hot gaseous products. We develop a physically based model for the expansion that takes place when a vaporized fuel reacts to form hot gaseous products, and a related model for the similar expansion that takes place when a solid fuel is vaporized into a gaseous state. The hot gaseous products, smoke and soot rise under the influence of buoyancy and are rendered using a blackbody radiation model. We also model and render the blue core that results from radicals in the chemical reaction zone where fuel is converted into products. Our method allows the fire and smoke to interact with objects, and flammable objects can catch on fire."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15272","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15272","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1171","fieldValue":" The wireless network community has become increasingly aware of the benefits of data-driven link estimation and routing as compared with beacon-based approaches, but the issue of Biased Link Sampling (BLS) estimation has not been well studied even though it affects routing convergence in the presence of network and environment dynamics. Focusing on traffic-induced dynamics, we examine the open, unexplored question of how serious the BLS issue is and how to effectively address it when the routing metric ETX is used. For a wide range of traffic patterns and network topologies and using both node-oriented and network-wide analysis and experimentation, we discover that the optimal routing structure remains quite stable even though the properties of individual links and routes vary significantly as traffic pattern changes. In cases where the optimal routing structure does change, data-driven link estimation and routing is either guaranteed to converge to the optimal structure or empirically shown to converge to a close-to-optimal structure. These findings provide the foundation for addressing the BLS issue in the presence of traffic-induced dynamics and suggest approaches other than existing ones. These findings also demonstrate that it is possible to maintain an optimal, stable routing structure despite the fact that the properties of individual links and paths vary in response to network dynamics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1171","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2447","fieldValue":"Gonzalez-Gutierrez, Arturo"}
