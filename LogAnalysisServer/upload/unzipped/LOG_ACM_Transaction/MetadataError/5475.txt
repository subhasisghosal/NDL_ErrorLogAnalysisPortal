While it was known that purely structural, geometric, distance-based measures of structural similarity, such as Dali\/FSSP, could largely replicate hand-curated schemes such as SCOP at the family level, it was an open question as to whether any such scheme could approximate SCOP at the more distant superfamily and fold levels. We partially answer this question in the affirmative, by designing a clustering scheme based on Matt that approximately matches SCOP at the superfamily level, and demonstrates qualitative differences in performance between Matt and DaliLite. Implications for the debate over the organization of protein fold space are discussed. Based on our clustering of protein space, we introduce the Mattbench benchmark set, a new collection of structural alignments useful for testing sequence aligners on more distantly homologous proteins."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4714","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4714","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4714","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4715","fieldValue":"Payne, Philip R O"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4715","fieldValue":" Binary (0,1) matrices, commonly known as transactional databases, can represent many application data, including gene-phenotype data where \"1â\u20AC? represents a confirmed gene-phenotype relation and \"0â\u20AC? represents an unknown relation. It is natural to ask what information is hidden behind these \"0â\u20AC?s and \"1â\u20AC?s. Unfortunately, recent matrix completion methods, though very effective in many cases, are less likely to infer something interesting from these (0,1)-matrices. To answer this challenge, we propose Ind Evi, a very succinct and effective algorithm to perform independent-evidence-based transactional database transformation. Each entry of a (0,1)-matrix is evaluated by \"independent evidenceâ\u20AC? (maximal supporting patterns) extracted from the whole matrix for this entry. The value of an entry, regardless of its value as 0 or 1, has completely no effect for its independent evidence. The experiment on a gene-phenotype database shows that our method is highly promising in ranking candidate genes and predicting unknown disease genes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4715","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4715","fieldValue":"Transactional database, binary matrix, frequent item set mining, maximal biclique, phenotype, disease gene, prioritization, matrix completion."}
