Specifically, we distinguish the flows into two crucial classes: inelastic for modeling high-priority, delay-sensitive, and fixed-throughput applications; and elastic for modeling low-priority, delay-tolerant, and throughput-greedy applications. We note that the coexistence of such diverse flows creates complex interactions at multiple levels (e.g., flow and packet levels), which prevent the use of earlier design approaches that dominantly assume homogeneous traffic. In this work, we develop the mathematical framework and novel design methodologies needed to support such heterogeneous requirements and propose provably optimal network algorithms that account for the multilevel interactions between the flows. To that end, we first formulate a network optimization problem that incorporates the above throughput and service prioritization requirements of the two traffic types. We, then develop a distributed joint load-balancing and congestion control algorithm that achieves the dual goal of maximizing the aggregate utility gained by the elastic flows while satisfying the fixed throughput and prioritization requirements of the inelastic flows. Next, we extend our joint algorithm in two ways to further improve its performance: in delay through a virtual queue implementation with minimal throughput degradation and in utilization by allowing for dynamic multipath routing for elastic flows. A unique characteristic of our proposed dynamic routing solution is the novel two-stage queueing architecture it introduces to satisfy the service prioritization requirement."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10129","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10129","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10129","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10130","fieldValue":" Several range reencoding schemes have been proposed to mitigate the effect of range expansion and the limitations of small capacity, large power consumption, and high heat generation of ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)-based packet classification systems. However, they all disregard the semantics of classifiers and therefore miss significant opportunities for space compression. In this paper, we propose new approaches to range reencoding by taking into account classifier semantics. Fundamentally different from prior work, we view reencoding as a topological transformation process from one colored hyperrectangle to another, where the color is the decision associated with a given packet. Stated another way, we reencode the entire classifier by considering the classifier's decisions rather than reencode only ranges in the classifier ignoring the classifier's decisions as prior work does. We present two orthogonal, yet composable, reencoding approaches: domain compression and prefix alignment. Our techniques significantly outperform all previous reencoding techniques. In comparison to prior art, our experimental results show that our techniques achieve at least five times more space reduction in terms of TCAM space for an encoded classifier and at least three times more space reduction in terms of TCAM space for a reencoded classifier and its transformers. This, in turn, leads to improved throughput and decreased power consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10130","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10130","fieldValue":"ACM"}
