Working on a more global and structural level of the input, our technique allows and even encourages replication of its structural elements, while taking into account their semantics and expected geometric interrelations such as alignments and adjacency. The algorithm performs automatic replication and scaling of these elements while preserving their structures. Instead of formulating and solving a complex constrained optimization, we decompose the input model into a set of sequences, each of which is a 1D structure that is relatively straightforward to retarget. As the sequences are retargeted in turn, they progressively constrain the retargeting of the remaining sequences. We demonstrate interactivity and variability of results from our retargeting algorithm using many examples modeled after real-world architectures exhibiting various forms of irregularity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16581","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16581","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16582","fieldValue":"Shen, Chao-Hui"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16582","fieldValue":"Huang, Shi-Sheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16582","fieldValue":"Hu, Shi-Min"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16582","fieldValue":" Automatically discovering high-level facade structures in unorganized 3D point clouds of urban scenes is crucial for applications like digitalization of real cities. However, this problem is challenging due to poor-quality input data, contaminated with severe missing areas, noise and outliers. This work introduces the concept of adaptive partitioning to automatically derive a flexible and hierarchical representation of 3D urban facades. Our key observation is that urban facades are largely governed by concatenated and\/or interlaced grids. Hence, unlike previous automatic facade analysis works which are typically restricted to globally rectilinear grids, we propose to automatically partition the facade in an adaptive manner, in which the splitting direction, the number and location of splitting planes are all adaptively determined. Such an adaptive partition operation is performed recursively to generate a hierarchical representation of the facade. We show that the concept of adaptive partitioning is also applicable to flexible and robust analysis of image facades. We evaluate our method on a dozen of LiDAR scans of various complexity and styles, and the image facades from the eTRIMS database and the Ecole Centrale Paris database. A series of applications that benefit from our approach are also demonstrated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16582","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16582","fieldValue":"ACM"}
