This paper presents the design and implementation in GPGPUs of an exact alignment tool for nucleotide sequences based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform. We compare this algorithm with state-of-the-art implementations of the same algorithm over standard CPUs, and considering the same conditions in terms of I\/O. Excluding disk transfers, the implementation of the algorithm in GPUs shows a speedup larger than 12{\\times}, when compared to CPU execution. This implementation exploits the parallelism by concurrently searching different sequences on the same reference search tree, maximizing memory locality and ensuring a symmetric access to the data. The paper describes the behavior of the algorithm in GPU, showing a good scalability in the performance, only limited by the size of the GPU inner memory."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4806","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4806","fieldValue":"Using GPUs for the Exact Alignment of Short-Read Genetic Sequences by Means of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4807","fieldValue":"Wong, Hau-San"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4807","fieldValue":" Feature selection is widely established as one of the fundamental computational techniques in mining microarray data. Due to the lack of categorized information in practice, unsupervised feature selection is more practically important but correspondingly more difficult. Motivated by the cluster ensemble techniques, which combine multiple clustering solutions into a consensus solution of higher accuracy and stability, recent efforts in unsupervised feature selection proposed to use these consensus solutions as oracles. However, these methods are dependent on both the particular cluster ensemble algorithm used and the knowledge of the true cluster number. These methods will be unsuitable when the true cluster number is not available, which is common in practice. In view of the above problems, a new unsupervised feature ranking method is proposed to evaluate the importance of the features based on consensus affinity. Different from previous works, our method compares the corresponding affinity of each feature between a pair of instances based on the consensus matrix of clustering solutions. As a result, our method alleviates the need to know the true number of clusters and the dependence on particular cluster ensemble approaches as in previous works. Experiments on real gene expression data sets demonstrate significant improvement of the feature ranking results when compared to several state-of-the-art techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4807","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4807","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4807","fieldValue":"ACM"}
