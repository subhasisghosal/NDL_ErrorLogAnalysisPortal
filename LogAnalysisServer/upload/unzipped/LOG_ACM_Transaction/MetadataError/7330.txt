While the digital subsystems of the nodes are still following Moore's Law, there is no such trend regarding the performance of analog components. This work proposes a fully integrated architecture of both digital and analog components (including local oscillator) that offers significant reduction in cost, size, and overall power consumption of the node. Even though such a radical architecture cannot offer the reliable tuning of standard designs, it is shown that by using random network coding, a dense network of such nodes can achieve throughput linear in the number of channels available for communication. Moreover, the ratio of the achievable throughput of the untuned network to the throughput of a tuned network with perfect coordination is shown to be close to 1\/e. This work uses network coding to leverage the fact that throughput equal to the max-flow in a graph is achievable even if the topology is not know a priori. However, the challenge here is finding the max-flow of the random graph corresponding to the network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9475","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9475","fieldValue":"{\"issue\":\"SI\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9475","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9475","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9476","fieldValue":"Wan, Peng-Jun"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9476","fieldValue":"Yi, Chih-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9476","fieldValue":" One of the main applications of wireless sensor networks is to provide proper coverage of their deployment regions. A wireless sensor network k-covers its deployment region if every point in its deployment region is within the coverage ranges of at least k sensors. In this paper, we assume that the sensors are deployed as either a Poisson point process or a uniform point process in a square or disk region, and study how the probability of the k-coverage changes with the sensing radius or the number of sensors. Our results take the complicated boundary effect into account, rather than avoiding it by assuming the toroidal metric as done in the literature."}
