Despite the emergence of numerous RCNA discovering methods, most of them are unable to detect RCNAs in complex patterns that are influenced by complicating factors including aberration in partial samples, co-existing of gains and losses and normal-like tumor samples. Here, we propose a novel computational method, called non-negative sparse singular value decomposition NN-SSVD, to address the RCNA discovering problem in complex patterns. In NN-SSVD, the measurement of RCNA is based on the aberration frequency in a part of samples rather than all samples, which can circumvent the complexity of different RCNA patterns. We evaluate NN-SSVD on synthetic dataset by comparison on detection scores and Receiver Operating Characteristics curves, and the results show that NN-SSVD outperforms existing methods in RCNA discovery and demonstrate more robustness to RCNA complicating factors. Applying our approach on a breast cancer dataset, we successfully identify a number of genomic regions that are strongly correlated with previous studies, which harbor a bunch of known breast cancer associated genes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5342","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5342","fieldValue":"Discovering Recurrent Copy Number Aberrations in Complex Patterns via Non-Negative Sparse Singular Value Decomposition"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5343","fieldValue":" AbstractExtracting biomedical event from literatures has attracted much attention recently. By now, most of the state-of-the-art systems have been based on pipelines which suffer from cascading errors, and the words encoded by one-hot are unable to represent the semantic information. Joint inference with dual decomposition and novel word embeddings are adopted to address the two problems, respectively, in this work. Word embeddings are learnt from large scale unlabeled texts and integrated as an unsupervised feature into other rich features based on dependency parse graphs to detect triggers and arguments. The proposed system consists of four components: trigger detector, argument detector, jointly inference with dual decomposition, and rule-based semantic post-processing, and outperforms the state-of-the-art systems. On the development set of BioNLP'09, the F-score is 59.77 percent on the primary task, which is 0.96 percent higher than the best system. On the test set of BioNLP'11, the F-score is 56.09 and 0.89 percent higher than the best published result that do not adopt additional techniques. On the test set of BioNLP'13, the F-score reaches 53.19 percent which is 2.22 percent higher than the best result."}
