{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13143","fieldValue":" Power analysis tools are an integral component of any current power sign-off methodology. The performance of a design's power grid affects the timing and functionality of a circuit, directly impacting the overall performance. Ensuring power grid robustness implies taking into account, among others, static and dynamic effects of voltage drop, ground bounce, and electromigration. This type of verification is usually done by simulation, targeting a worst-case scenario where devices, switching almost simultaneously, could impose stern current demands on the power grid. While determination of the exact worst-case switching conditions from the grid perspective is usually not practical, the choice of simulation stimuli has a critical effect on the results of the analysis. Targetting safe but unrealistic settings could lead to pessimistic results and costly overdesigns in terms of die area. In this article we describe a software tool that generates a reasonable, realistic, set of stimuli for simulation. The approach proposed accounts for timing and spatial restrictions that arise from the circuit's netlist and placement and generates an approximation to the worst-case condition. The resulting stimuli indicate that only a fraction of the gates change in any given timing window, leading to a more robust verification methodology, especially in the dynamic case. Generating such stimuli is akin to performing a standard static timing analysis, so the tool fits well within conventional design frameworks. Furthermore, the tool can be used for hotspot detection in early design stages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13143","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13143","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13144","fieldValue":" The existing work on via allocation in 3D ICs ignores power\/ground vias' ability to simultaneously reduce voltage bounce and remove heat. This article develops the first in-depth study on the allocation of power\/ground vias in 3D ICs with simultaneous consideration of power and thermal integrity. By identifying principal ports and parameters, effective electrical and thermal macromodels are employed to provide dynamic power and thermal integrity as well as sensitivity with respect to via density. With the use of sensitivity, an efficient via allocation simultaneously driven by power and thermal integrity is developed. Experiments show that, compared to sequential power and thermal optimization using static integrity, sequential optimization using the dynamic integrity reduces nonsignal vias by up to 18&percnt;, and simultaneous optimization using dynamic integrity further reduces nonsignal vias by up to 45.5&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13145","fieldValue":"Castro-Lpez, R."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13145","fieldValue":" This article introduces an evolution-based methodology, named memetic single-objective evolutionary algorithm (MSOEA), for automated sizing of high-performance analog integrated circuits. Memetic algorithms may achieve higher global and local search ability by properly combining operators from different standard evolutionary algorithms. By integrating operators from the differential evolution algorithm, from the real-coded genetic algorithm, operators inspired by the simulated annealing algorithm, and a set of constraint handling techniques, MSOEA specializes in handling analog circuit design problems with numerous and tight design constraints. The method has been tested through the sizing of several analog circuits. The results show that design specifications are met and objective functions are highly optimized. Comparisons with available methods like genetic algorithm and differential evolution in conjunction with static penalty functions, as well as with intelligent selection-based differential evolution, are also carried out, showing that the proposed algorithm has important advantages in terms of constraint handling ability and optimization quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13145","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13145","fieldValue":"ACM"}
