In this paper we present a pattern discovery method, named Fast Entropic Profiler, that is based on a local entropy function that captures the importance of a region with respect to the whole genome. The local entropy function has been introduced by Vinga and Almeida in [29], here we discuss and improve the original formulation. We provide a linear time and linear space algorithm called Fast Entropic Profiler (FastEP), as opposed to the original quadratic implementation. Moreover we propose an alternative normalization that can be also efficiently implemented. We show that FastEP is suitable for large genomes and for the discovery of patterns with unbounded length.

Despite all the efforts that have been made so far, finding an accurate and fast computational approach to solve the PFR still remains a challenging problem for bioinformatics and computational biology. In this study, we propose the concept of segmented-based feature extraction technique to provide local evolutionary information embedded in position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and structural information embedded in the predicted secondary structure of proteins using SPINE-X. We also employ the concept of occurrence feature to extract global discriminatory information from PSSM and SPINE-X. By applying a support vector machine (SVM) to our extracted features, we enhance the protein fold prediction accuracy for 7.4 percent over the best results reported in the literature. We also report 73.8 percent prediction accuracy for a data set consisting of proteins with less than 25 percent sequence similarity rates and 80.7 percent prediction accuracy for a data set with proteins belonging to 110 folds with less than 40 percent sequence similarity rates. We also investigate the relation between the number of folds and the number of features being used and show that the number of features should be increased to get better protein fold prediction results when the number of folds is relatively large."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5060","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5060","fieldValue":"A segmentation-based method to extract structural and evolutionary features for protein fold recognition"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5060","fieldValue":"ACM"}
