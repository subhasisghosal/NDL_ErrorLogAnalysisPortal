An algorithm is presented that generates a visibility-ordering of an acyclic convex set of meshed convex polyhedra. This algorithm takes time linear in the size of the mesh. Modifications to this algorithm and\/or preprocessing techniques are described that permit nonconvex cells nonconvex meshes (meshes with cavities and\/or voids), meshes with cycles, and sets of disconnected meshes to be ordered. Visibility-ordering of polyhedra is applicable to scientific visualization, particularly direct volume rendering. It is shown how the ordering algorithms can be used for domain decomposition of finite element meshes for parallel processing, and how the data structures used by these algorithms can be used to solve the spatial point location problem. The effects of cyclically obstructing polyhedra are discussed and methods for their elimination are described, including the use of the Delaunay triangulation. Methods for converting nonconvex meshes into convex meshes are described."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15063","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15063","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2423","fieldValue":" We prove that given an undirected graph G on n vertices and an integer k, one can compute, in polynomial time in n, a graph Gâ\u20AC² with at most $4k^2 vertices and an integer kâ\u20AC² such that G has a feedback vertex set of size at most k iff Gâ\u20AC² has a feedback vertex set of size at most kâ\u20AC².

One aspect of the theory of rational surfaces that is not well understood is what happens when a rational parameterization takes on the value (0\/0, 0\/0, 0\/0) for some parameter value. Such parameter values are called base points of the parameterization. Base points can be introduced into a rational parameterization in BeÂ´zier form by setting weights of appropriate control points to zero. By judiciously introducing base points, one can create parameterizations of four-, five- and six-sided surface patches using rational BeÂ´zier surfaces defined over triangular domains. Subdivision techniques allow rendering and smooth meshing of such surfaces. Properties of base points also lead to a new understanding of incompatible edge twist methods such as Gregory's patch."}
