The algorithm is designed to be independent of the data structures used to store the matrices. The user must provide a subroutine, CHLSKY, which acts as an interface between PDFIND and the matrix data structures. CHLSKY also provides the user control over the number of iterations of the algorithm. Implementations of CHLSKY are included which call LINPAC routines for full matrices as well as symmetric banded matrices."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18529","fieldValue":"Algorithm 646: PDFIND: a routine to find a positive definite linear combination of two real symmetric matrices"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18529","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/18530","fieldValue":"Hake, J-Fr"}
