In this article, we first propose a circuit-switched interconnection architecture which uses crossroad switches to construct dedicated channels dynamically between any pairs of cores for nonhuge application-specific SoCs. The structure of the crossroad switch is simple, which can be regarded as a NoC-lite router, and we can easily construct a low-power on-chip network with these switches by a system-level design methodology. We also present the design methodology to tailor the proposed interconnection architecture to low-power structures by two proposed optimization schemes with profiled communication characteristics. The first scheme is power-aware topology construction, which can build low-power application-specific interconnection topologies. To further reduce the power consumption, we propose the second optimization scheme to predetermine the operating mode of dual-mode switches in the NoC at runtime. We evaluate several interconnection techniques, and the results show that the proposed architecture is more low-power and high-performance than others under some constraints and scale boundaries. We take multimedia applications as case studies, and experimental results show the power savings of power-aware topology approximate to 49&percnt; of the interconnection architecture. The power consumption can be further reduced approximately 25&percnt; by applying partially dedicated path mechanism."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13047","fieldValue":"Tailoring circuit-switched network-on-chip to application-specific system-on-chip by two optimization schemes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13048","fieldValue":"Afzali-Kusha, A."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13048","fieldValue":" In this article, a wavelet-based dynamic power management policy (WBDPM) is proposed. In this approach, the workload source (service requester) is modeled by a nonstationary time series which, in turn, represented by a nondecimated Haar wavelet as its basis. The proposed approach is robust and has the ability to minimize energy dissipation under different performance constraints. To assess the accuracy of the model, the algorithm was implemented for data extracted from the hard disks of computers.
