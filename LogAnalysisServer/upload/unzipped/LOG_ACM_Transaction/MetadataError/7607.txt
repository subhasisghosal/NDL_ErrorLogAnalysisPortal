The pricing signals can be different types of signals such as packet loss, queueing delay, etc, or different values of the same type of signal such as different ECN marking values based on the same actual link congestion level. Unlike in a homogeneous network, the bandwidth allocation now depends on router parameters and flow arrival patterns. It can be non-unique, suboptimal and unstable. In Tang et al. (\"Equilibrium of heterogeneous congestion control: Existence and uniqueness,\" IEEE\/ACM Trans. Netw., vol. 15, no. 4, pp. 824-837, Aug. 2007), existence and uniqueness of equilibrium of heterogeneous protocols are investigated. This paper extends the study with two objectives: analyzing the optimality and stability of such networks and designing control schemes to improve those properties. First, we demonstrate the intricate behavior of a heterogeneous network through simulations and present a framework to help understand its equilibrium properties. Second, we propose a simple source-based algorithm to decouple bandwidth allocation from router parameters and flow arrival patterns by only updating a linear parameter in the sources' algorithms on a slow timescale. It steers a network to the unique optimal equilibrium. The scheme can be deployed incrementally as the existing protocol needs no change and only new protocols need to adopt the slow timescale adaptation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10024","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10025","fieldValue":" In recent years, both sophistication and damage potential of Internet worms have increased tremendously. To understand their threat, we need to look into their payload for signatures as well as propagation pattern for Internet-scale behavior. An accurate analytical propagation model allows us to comprehensively study how a worm propagates under various conditions, which is often computationally too intensive for simulations. More importantly, it gives us an insight into the impact of each worm\/ network parameter on the propagation of the worm. Traditionally, most modeling work in this area concentrates on the relatively simple random-scanning worms. However, modeling the permutation-scanning worms, a class of worms that are fast yet stealthy, has been a challenge to date. This paper proposes a mathematical model that precisely characterizes the propagation patterns of the general permutation-scanning worms. The analytical framework captures the interactions among all infected hosts by a series of interdependent differential equations, which are then integrated into closed-form solutions that together present the overall worm behavior. We use the model to study how each worm\/network parameter affects the worm propagation. We also investigate the impact of dynamic network conditions on the correctness of the model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10025","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10025","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10025","fieldValue":"ACM"}
