It is a software environment for building component-based AAC applications, grounded on the Design for All principles and a hybrid---community and commercial---Open Source development model. ITHACA addresses the developers, the vendors, as well as the people who use AAC. We introduce a new viewpoint on the AAC product design-develop-distribute lifecycle, and a novel way to search-select-modify-maintain the AAC aid. ITHACA provides programmers with a set of tools and reusable Open Source code for building AAC software components. It also facilitates AAC product vendors to put together sophisticated applications using the available on the Web, independently premanufactured, free or commercial software parts. Furthermore, it provides people who use AAC with a variety of compatible AAC software products which incorporate multimodal, user-tailored interfaces that can fulfill their changing needs. The ITHACA architecture and the proposed fusion of past and current approaches, trends and technologies are explained. ITHACA has been successfully applied by implementing a family of AAC products, based on interchangeable components. Several ready to use ITHACA-based components, including on-screen keyboards, Text-to-Speech, symbol selection sets, e-chatting, emailing, and scanning-based input, as well as four complete communication aids addressing different user cases have been developed. This demonstration showed good acceptance of the ITHACA applications and substantial improvement of the end usersâ\u20AC™ communication skills. Developersâ\u20AC™ experience on working in ITHACAâ\u20AC™s Open Source projects was also positively evaluated. More importantly, the potential contribution of the component-based framework and Open Source development model combination to the AAC community emerged."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1434","fieldValue":"ITHACA: An Open Source Framework for Building Component-Based Augmentative and Alternative Communication Applications"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5090","fieldValue":" In this paper we present a cohesive structural itemset miner aiming to discover interesting patterns in a set of data objects within a multidimensional spatial structure by combining the cohesion and the support of the pattern. We propose two ways to build the itemset miner, VertexOne and VertexAll, in an attempt to find a balance between accuracy and run-times. The experiments show that VertexOne performs better, and finds almost the same itemsets as VertexAll in a much shorter time. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by applying it to find interesting patterns of amino acids in spatial proximity within a set of proteins based on their atomic coordinates in the protein molecular structure. Several patterns found by the cohesive structural itemset miner contain amino acids that frequently co-occur in the spatial structure, even if they are distant in the primary protein sequence and only brought together by protein folding. Further various indications were found that some of the discovered patterns seem to represent common underlying support structures within the proteins."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5090","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5091","fieldValue":" We present a cancer genomic analysis pipeline which takes as input sequencing reads for both germline and tumor genomes and outputs filtered lists of all genetic mutations in the form of short ranked list of the most affected genes in the tumor, using either the Complete Genomics or Illumina platforms. A novel reporting and ranking system has been developed that makes use of publicly available datasets and literature specific to each patient, including new methods for using publicly available expression data in the absence of proper control data. Previously implicated small and large variations (including gene fusions) are reported in addition to probable driver mutations. Relationships between cancer and the sequenced tumor genome are highlighted using a network-based approach that integrates known and predicted protein-protein, protein-TF, and protein-drug interaction data. By using an integrative approach, effects of genetic variations on gene expression are used to provide further evidence of driver mutations. This pipeline has been developed with the aim to be used in assisting in the analysis of pediatric tumors, as an unbiased and automated method for interpreting sequencing results along with identifying potentially therapeutic drugs and their targets. We present results that agree with previous literature and highlight specific findings in a few patients."}
