Specifically, given an integer m, SRRIT computes a matrix Q with m orthonormal columns and real quasi-triangular matrix T or order m such that the equation AQ = QT is satisfied up to a tolerance specified by the user. The eigenvalues of T are approximations to the m eigenvalues of largest absolute magnitude of A and the columns of Q span the invariant subspace corresponding to those eigenvalues. SRRIT references A only through a user-provided subroutine to form the product AQ; hence it is suitable for large sparse problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18900","fieldValue":"Algorithm 776: SRRIT: a Fortran subroutine to calculate the dominant invariant subspace of a nonsymmetric matrix"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18901","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18901","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18902","fieldValue":" L-BFGS-B is a limited-memory algorithm for solving large nonlinear optimization problems subject to simple bounds on the variables.
