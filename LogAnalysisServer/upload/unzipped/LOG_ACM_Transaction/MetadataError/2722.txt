These include solvers that are designed for the solution of positive-definite systems as well as solvers that are principally intended for solving indefinite problems. The available choice can make it difficult for users to know which solver is the most appropriate for their use. In this study, we use performance profiles as a tool for evaluating and comparing the performance of the HSL solvers on an extensive set of test problems taken from a range of practical applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19066","fieldValue":"A numerical evaluation of HSL packages for the direct solution of large sparse, symmetric linear systems of equations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19066","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19067","fieldValue":" A block tridiagonalization algorithm is proposed for transforming a sparse (or \"effectively\" sparse) symmetric matrix into a related block tridiagonal matrix, such that the eigenvalue error remains bounded by some prescribed accuracy tolerance. It is based on a heuristic for imposing a block tridiagonal structure on matrices with a large percentage of zero or \"effectively zero\" (with respect to the given accuracy tolerance) elements. In the light of a recently developed block tridiagonal divide-and-conquer eigensolver [Gansterer, Ward, Muller, and Goddard, III, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 25 (2003), pp. 65--85], for which block tridiagonalization may be needed as a preprocessing step, the algorithm also provides an option for attempting to produce at least a few very small diagonal blocks in the block tridiagonal matrix. This leads to low time complexity of the last merging operation in the block divide-and-conquer method. Numerical experiments are presented and various block tridiagonalization strategies are compared."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19067","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19067","fieldValue":"ACM"}
