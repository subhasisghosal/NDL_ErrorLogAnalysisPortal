To support the execution of these applications in conjunction with traditional non-real-time applications, we have created SMART, a Scheduler for Multimedia And Real-Time applications. SMART supports applications with time constraints, and provides dynamic feedback to applications to allow them to adapt to the current load. In addition, the support for real-time applications is integrated with the support for conventional computations. This allows the user to prioritize across real-time and conventional computations, and dictate how the processor is to be shared among applications of the same priority. As the system load changes, SMART adjusts the allocation of resources dynamically and seamlessly. It can dynamically shed real-time computations and regulate the execution rates of real-time tasks when the system is overloaded, while providing better value in underloaded conditions than previously proposed schemes.We have implemented SMART in the Solaris UNIX operating system and measured its performance against other schedulers commonly used in research and practice in executing real-time, interactive, and batch applications. Our experimental results demonstrate SMART's superior performance over fair queueing and UNIX SVR4 schedulers in supporting multimedia applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12261","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12261","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12262","fieldValue":"Van Renesse, Robbert"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12262","fieldValue":" Scalable management and self-organizational capabilities areemerging as central requirements for a generation of large-scale,highly dynamic, distributed applications. We have developed anentirely new distributed information management system calledAstrolabe. Astrolabe collects large-scale system state, permittingrapid updates and providing on-the-fly attribute aggregation. Thislatter capability permits an application to locate a resource, andalso offers a scalable way to track system state as it evolves overtime. The combination of features makes it possible to solve a widevariety of management and self-configuration problems. This paperdescribes the design of the system with a focus upon itsscalability. After describing the Astrolabe service, we presentexamples of the use of Astrolabe for locating resources,publish-subscribe, and distributed synchronization in largesystems. Astrolabe is implemented using a peer-to-peer protocol,and uses a restricted form of mobile code based on the SQL querylanguage for aggregation. This protocol gives rise to a novelconsistency model. Astrolabe addresses several securityconsiderations using a built-in PKI. The scalability of the systemis evaluated using both simulation and experiments; these confirmthat Astrolabe could scale to thousands and perhaps millions ofnodes, with information propagation delays in the tens of seconds."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12262","fieldValue":"Astrolabe: A robust and scalable technology for distributed system monitoring, management, and data mining"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12262","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12262","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12263","fieldValue":"Harchol-Balter, Mor"}
