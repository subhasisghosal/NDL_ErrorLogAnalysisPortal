{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21057","fieldValue":" Due to the large access latency of hard disks during data retrieval in computer systems, buffer caching mechanisms have been studied extensively in database and operating systems. By storing requested data into the buffer cache, subsequent requests can be directly serviced without accessing slow disk storage. Meanwhile, high-speed storage media like PCM (phase-change memory) have emerged recently, and one may wonder if the traditional buffer cache will be still effective for these high-speed storage media. This article answers the question by showing that the buffer cache is still effective in such environments due to the software overhead and the bimodal data access characteristics. Based on this observation, we present a new buffer cache management scheme appropriately designed for the system where the speed gap between cache and storage is narrow. To this end, we analyze the condition that caching will be effective and find the characteristics of access patterns that can be exploited in managing buffer cache for high performance storage like PCM."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21057","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21057","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21058","fieldValue":" In this article, we present LWDLS, a lightweight data location service designed for Exascale storage systems (storage systems with order of $10^18$ bytes) and geo-distributed storage systems (large storage systems with physically distributed locations). LWDLS provides a search-based data location solution, and enables free data placement, movement, and replication. In LWDLS, probe and prune protocols are introduced that reduce topology mismatch, and a heuristic flooding search algorithm (HFS) is presented that achieves higher search efficiency than pure flooding search while having comparable search speed and coverage to the pure flooding search. LWDLS is lightweight and scalable in terms of incorporating low overhead, high search efficiency, no global state, and avoiding periodic messages. LWDLS is fully distributed and can be used in nondeterministic storage systems and in deterministic storage systems to deal with cases where search is needed. Extensive simulations modeling large-scale High Performance Computing (HPC) storage environments provide representative performance outcomes. Performance is evaluated by metrics including search scope, search efficiency, and average neighbor distance. Results show that LWDLS is able to locate data efficiently with low cost of state maintenance in arbitrary network environments. Through these simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of protocols and search algorithm of LWDLS."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21058","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21058","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3012","fieldValue":" This article proposes a predicate-argument structure based Textual Entailment Recognition system exploiting wide-coverage lexical knowledge.

In matching between predicate-arguments, wide-coverage relations between words\/phrases such as synonym and is-a are utilized, which are automatically acquired from a dictionary, Web corpus, and Wikipedia."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3012","fieldValue":"RTE"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3012","fieldValue":"Predicate-Argument Structure-Based Textual Entailment Recognition System Exploiting Wide-Coverage Lexical Knowledge"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3012","fieldValue":"ACM"}
