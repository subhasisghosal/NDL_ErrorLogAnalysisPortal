We describe a Fortran implementation and the considerations that went into its design. A novel feature is that (almost) all the code defining one problem is textually contiguous in the Fortran text, unlike for example the DETEST package for ODE initial-value solvers where the definition of a problem is spread over several routines. The described implementation forms the infrastructure of the SLDRVER interactive package which supports exploration of a set of Sturm-Liouville problems with the four SL-solvers SLEIGN, SLEDGE, SL02F, and SLEIGN2. A â\u20ACœstandardâ\u20AC? set of 60 problems is provided, but it is simple to replace this by another one."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18935","fieldValue":" We give technical details of the Sturm-Liouville test package SLTSTPAK, complementing the companion article (this issue) on its design. SLTSTPAK comprises the follwing : a specification of how to write a routine TSTSET containing a set of Sturm-Liouville problems; a number of routines that act as a harness between a TSTSET, written to this specification, and a driver program.
