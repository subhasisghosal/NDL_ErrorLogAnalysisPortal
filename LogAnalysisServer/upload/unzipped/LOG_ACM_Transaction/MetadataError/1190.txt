Let &ell; âˆˆ $Z^+ be fixed. Alon et al. [1990] presented an algorithm that in O(n1\/2m) time, outputs either a $K_&ell;-minor of G, or a separation of G of order O(n1\/2). Whether there is a O(n + m)-time algorithm for this theorem was left as an open problem. In this article, we obtain a O(n + m)-time algorithm at the expense of a O(n2\/3) separator. Moreover, our algorithm exhibits a trade-off between time complexity and the order of the separator. In particular, for any given &epsi; âˆˆ [0,1\/2], our algorithm outputs either a K&ell;$-minor of G, or a separation of G with order O(n(2âˆ\u2019&epsi;)\/3 in O(n1 + &epsi;$+m) time. As an application we give a fast approximation algorithm for finding an independent set in a graph with no K&ell;-minor."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14560","fieldValue":" Besides topological relationships and approximate relationships, cardinal directions like north and southwest have turned out to be an important class of qualitative spatial relationships. They are of interdisciplinary interest in fields like cognitive science, robotics, artificial intelligence, and qualitative spatial reasoning. In spatial databases and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) they are frequently used as join and selection criteria in spatial queries. However, the available computational models of cardinal directions suffer a number of problems like the use of too coarse approximations of the two spatial operand objects in terms of single representative points or minimum bounding rectangles, the lacking property of converseness of the cardinal directions computed, and the limited applicability to simple instead of complex regions only. This article proposes and formally defines a novel two-phase model, called the Objects Interaction Matrix (OIM) model, that solves these problems, and determines cardinal directions for even complex regions. The model consists of a tiling phase and an interpretation phase. In the tiling phase, a tiling strategy first determines the zones belonging to the nine cardinal directions of each individual region object and then intersects them. The result leads to a bounded grid called objects interaction grid. For each grid cell the information about the region objects that intersect it is stored in an objects interaction matrix. In the subsequent interpretation phase, a well-defined interpretation method is applied to such a matrix and determines the cardinal direction. Spatial example queries illustrate our new cardinal direction concept that is embedded in a spatial extension of SQL and provides user-defined cardinal direction predicates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14561","fieldValue":" Primary key violations provide a natural means for modeling uncertainty in the relational data model. A repair (or possible world) of a database is then obtained by selecting a maximal number of tuples without ever selecting two distinct tuples that have the same primary key value. For a Boolean query q, the problem CERTAINTY(q) takes as input a database db and asks whether q evaluates to true on every repair of db. We are interested in determining queries q for which CERTAINTY(q) is first-order expressible (and hence in the low complexity class ACÂ°). For queries q in the class of conjunctive queries without self-join, we provide a necessary syntactic condition for first-order expressibility of CERTAINTY(q). For acyclic queries (in the sense of Beeri et al. &lsqb;1983&rsqb;), this necessary condition is also a sufficient condition. So we obtain a decision procedure for first-order expressibility of CERTAINTY(q) when q is acyclic and without self-join. We also show that if CERTAINTY(q) is first-order expressible, its first-order definition, commonly called certain first-order rewriting, can be constructed in a rather straightforward way."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14561","fieldValue":"ACM"}
