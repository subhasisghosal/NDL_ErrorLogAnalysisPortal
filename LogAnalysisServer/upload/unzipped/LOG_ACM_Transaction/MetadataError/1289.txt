{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15012","fieldValue":" This paper develops and explains the construction of a piecewise quartic space curve that interpolates positional, tangent, and curvature data. The construction is local and explicit; that is, it does not involve the solution of equations. If only positional data are known, then the tangent and curvature data can he derived by simple local default rules. Another option is to reduce the degree of the curve or minimize the a-norm of its derivative by solving a diagonally dominant, banded, linear system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15012","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15012","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15013","fieldValue":" B-splines are constructed from Bézier curves solely using de Casteljau's construction. Divided differences are not being used, nor is Mansfield's recurrence formula presupposed. Yet, it is shown how to differentiate, subdivide, and evaluate a B-spline. These results are derived from the corresponding techniques of Bézier curves."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15013","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15013","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2417","fieldValue":" We establish the first nontrivial lower bounds on time-space trade-offs for the selection problem. We prove that any comparison-based randomized algorithm for finding the median requires Ω(nlog $log_S n) expected time in the RAM model (or more generally in the comparison branching program model), if we have S bits of extra space besides the read-only input array. This bound is tight for all S &Gt; log n, and remains true even if the array is given in a random order. Our result thus answers a 16-year-old question of Munro and Raman &lsqb;1996&rsqb;, and also complements recent lower bounds that are restricted to sequential access, as in the multipass streaming model &lsqb;Chakrabarti et al. 2008b&rsqb;. We also prove that any comparison-based, deterministic, multipass streaming algorithm for finding the median requires $Ω(nlog^&ast;(n\/s)+ nlogs$ n) worst-case time (in scanning plus comparisons), if we have s cells of space. This bound is also tight for all s &Gt;log2$ n. We get deterministic lower bounds for I\/O-efficient algorithms as well. The proofs in this article are self-contained and do not rely on communication complexity techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2417","fieldValue":"RAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2417","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2417","fieldValue":"ACM"}
