This situation reflects the historical duality that has its roots in the once divided telephone and data environment. The telephone circuit oriented service requires protection, i.e., provisioning of readily available spare resources to replace working resources in case of a fault. The datagram oriented service relies upon restoration, i.e., dynamic search for and reallocation of affected resources via actions such as routing table updates.The current trend in networking, however, is gradually driving the design of networks toward a unified solution that will jointly support traditional voice and data services, as well as a variety of novel multimedia applications. The growing importance of concepts, such as quality of service (QoS) and differentiated services--which provide multiple levels of service performance in the same network--evidences this trend.Consistently with this evolution, the concept of differentiated reliability (DiR) is formally introduced in the paper and applied to provide multiple reliability degrees (or classes) at the same network layer using a common protection mechanism, i.e., path switching. According to the DiR concept, each connection is guaranteed a minimum reliability degree, or equivalently a maximum downtime ratio, that is chosen by the client. The reliability degree chosen for a given connection is thus determined by the application requirements, and not by the actual network topology, design constraints, robustness of the network components, and span of the connection.An efficient algorithm is proposed to sub-optimally design the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) layer of a ring and illustrate the advantages of the DiR concept."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9429","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9429","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9429","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9430","fieldValue":" Multicast is an important application in all-optical WDM networks. The wavelength assignment problem for WDM multicast is to assign a set of wavelengths to the links of a given multicast tree. In an all-optical WDM network without wavelength conversions, wavelength assignment is the key to guarantee the quality of service and to reduce communication costs. In this paper, we study wavelength assignment for WDM multicast with two criteria, to cover the maximum number of destinations, and to minimize the wavelength costs. The computational complexity of the problem is studied. Three heuristic algorithms are proposed and the worst-case approximation ratios for some heuristic algorithms are given. We also derive a lower bound of the minimum total wavelength cost and an upper bound of the maximum number of reached destinations. The efficiency of the proposed heuristic algorithms and the effectiveness of the derived bounds are verified by the simulation results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9430","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9430","fieldValue":"ACM"}
