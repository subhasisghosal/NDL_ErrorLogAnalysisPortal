Here we propose such a method, starting with a set of sloppily pasted image pieces with gaps between them. We first extract salient curves that approach the gaps from non-tangential directions, and use likely correspondences between pairs of such curves to guide a novel tele-registration method that simultaneously aligns all the pieces together. A structure-driven image completion technique is then proposed to fill the gaps, allowing the subsequent employment of standard in-painting tools to finish the job."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16955","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16955","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16956","fieldValue":" Methods to undo the effects of motion blur are the subject of intense research, but evaluating and tuning these algorithms has traditionally required either user input or the availability of ground-truth images. We instead develop a metric for automatically predicting the perceptual quality of images produced by state-of-the-art deblurring algorithms. The metric is learned based on a massive user study, incorporates features that capture common deblurring artifacts, and does not require access to the original images (i.e., is \"noreference\"). We show that it better matches user-supplied rankings than previous approaches to measuring quality, and that in most cases it outperforms conventional full-reference image-similarity measures. We demonstrate applications of this metric to automatic selection of optimal algorithms and parameters, and to generation of fused images that combine multiple deblurring results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16956","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16956","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16957","fieldValue":" Recent years have witnessed the emergence of new image smoothing techniques which have provided new insights and raised new questions about the nature of this well-studied problem. Specifically, these models separate a given image into its structure and texture layers by utilizing non-gradient based definitions for edges or special measures that distinguish edges from oscillations. In this study, we propose an alternative yet simple image smoothing approach which depends on covariance matrices of simple image features, aka the region covariances. The use of second order statistics as a patch descriptor allows us to implicitly capture local structure and texture information and makes our approach particularly effective for structure extraction from texture. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed approach leads to better image decompositions as compared to the state-of-the-art methods and preserves prominent edges and shading well. Moreover, we also demonstrate the applicability of our approach on some image editing and manipulation tasks such as image abstraction, texture and detail enhancement, image composition, inverse halftoning and seam carving."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16957","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16957","fieldValue":"ACM"}
