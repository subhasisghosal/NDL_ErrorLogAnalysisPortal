In this article, we provide a comprehensive solution to the problem of transferring the observations of the motion capture sensors to an animated character whose size and proportion may be different from the performer's. Our goal is to map as many of the important aspects of the motion to the target character as possible, while meeting the online, real-time demands of computer puppetry. We adopt a Kalman filter scheme that addresses motion capture noise issues in this setting. We provide the notion of dynamic importance of an end-effector that allows us to determine what aspects of the performance must be kept in the resulting motion. We introduce a novel inverse kinematics solver that realizes these important aspects within tight real-time constraints. Our approach is demonstrated by its application to broadcast television performances."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15200","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15200","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15201","fieldValue":" This article introduces a method for computing weighted averages on spheres based on least squares minimization that respects spherical distance. We prove existence and uniqueness properties of the weighted averages, and give fast iterative algorithms with linear and quadratic convergence rates. Our methods are appropriate to problems involving averages of spherical data in meteorological, geophysical, and astronomical applications. One simple application is a method for smooth averaging of quaternions, which generalizes Shoemake's spherical linear interpolation.The weighted averages methods allow a novel method of defining Bézier and spline curves on spheres, which provides direct generalization of Bézier and B-spline curves to spherical spline curves. We present a fast algorithm for spline interpolation on spheres. Our spherical splines allow the use of arbitrary knot positions; potential applications of spherical splines include smooth quaternion curves for applications in graphics, animation, robotics, and motion planning."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/15201","fieldValue":"B&eacute;zier curve"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15202","fieldValue":" Two planar triangulations with a correspondence between the pair of vertex sets are compatible (isomorphic) if they are topologically equivalent. This work describes methods for morphing compatible planar triangulations with identical convex boundaries in a manner that guarantees compatibility throughout the morph. These methods are based on a fundamental representation of a planar triangulation as a matrix that unambiguously describes the triangulation. Morphing the triangulations corresponds to interpolations between these matrices.We show that this basic approach can be extended to obtain better control over the morph, resulting in valid morphs with various natural properties. Two schemes, which generate the linear trajectory morph if it is valid, or a morph with trajectories close to linear otherwise, are presented. An efficient method for verification of validity of the linear trajectory morph between two triangulations is proposed. We also demonstrate how to obtain a morph with a natural evolution of triangle areas and how to find a smooth morph through a given intermediate triangulation."}
