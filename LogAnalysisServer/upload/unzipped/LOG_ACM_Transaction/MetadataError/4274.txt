Depending on the retrievalstrategy, link information can be local or global. Local linkinformation is derived from the set of documents returned asanswers to the current user query. Global link information isderived from all the documents in the collection. In this work, weinvestigate how the use of local link information compares to theuse of global link information. For the comparison, we run a seriesof experiments using a large document collection extracted from theWeb. For our reference collection, the results indicate that theuse of local link information improves precision by 74&percnt;.When global link information is used, precision improves by35&percnt;. However, when only the first 10 documents in theranking are considered, the average gain in precision obtained withthe use of global link information is higher than the gain obtainedwith the use of local link information. This is an interestingresult since it provides insight and justification for the use ofglobal link information in major Web search engines, where usersare mostly interested in the first 10 answers. Furthermore, globalinformation can be computed in the background, which allowsspeeding up query processing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23858","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23858","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23859","fieldValue":"Garcia-Molina, Hector"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23859","fieldValue":" The notion of similarity between objects finds use in many contexts, for example, in search engines, collaborative filtering, and clustering. Objects being compared often are modeled as sets, with their similarity traditionally determined based on set intersection. Intersection-based measures do not accurately capture similarity in certain domains, such as when the data is sparse or when there are known relationships between items within sets. We propose new measures that exploit a hierarchical domain structure in order to produce more intuitive similarity scores. We extend our similarity measures to provide appropriate results in the presence of multisets (also handled unsatisfactorily by traditional measures), for example, to correctly compute the similarity between customers who buy several instances of the same product (say milk), or who buy several products in the same category (say dairy products). We also provide an experimental comparison of our measures against traditional similarity measures, and report on a user study that evaluated how well our measures match human intuition."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23859","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23860","fieldValue":"Claussen, Joanne R S"}
