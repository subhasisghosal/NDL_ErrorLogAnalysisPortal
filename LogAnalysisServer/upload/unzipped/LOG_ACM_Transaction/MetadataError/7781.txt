Virtualization fosters the realization of several interesting deployment scenarios such as customized virtual networks, virtual services, and widearea corporate networks, with diverse performance objectives. In virtualizing a base station's uplink and downlink resources into slices, NVS meets three key requirements--isolation, customization, and efficient resource utilization--using two novel features: 1) NVS introduces a provably optimal slice scheduler that allows existence of slices with bandwidth-based and resource-based reservations simultaneously; and 2) NVS includes a generic framework for efficiently enabling customized flow scheduling within the base station on a per-slice basis. Through a prototype implementation and detailed evaluation on a WiMAX testbed, we demonstrate the efficacy of NVS. For instance, we show for both downlink and uplink directions that NVS can run different flow schedulers in different slices, run different slices simultaneously with different types of reservations, and perform slice-specific application optimizations for providing customized services."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10377","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10378","fieldValue":"Khouzani, M.

As a first step toward thwarting this security threat, we seek to quantify the maximum damage inflicted on the system due to such outbreaks and identify the most vicious attacks. We represent the propagation of malware in a battery-constrained mobile wireless network by an epidemic model in which the worm can dynamically control the rate at which it kills the infected node and also the transmission ranges and\/or the media scanning rates. At each moment of time, the worm at each node faces the following tradeoffs: 1) using larger transmission ranges and media scanning rates to accelerate its spread at the cost of exhausting the battery and thereby reducing the overall infection propagation rate in the long run; or 2) killing the node to inflict a large cost on the network, however at the expense of losing the chance of infecting more susceptible nodes at later times. We mathematically formulate the decision problems and utilize Pontryagin Maximum Principle from optimal control theory to quantify the damage that the malware can inflict on the network by deploying optimum decision rules. Next, we establish structural properties of the optimal strategy of the attacker over time. Specifically, we prove that it is optimal for the attacker to defer killing of the infective nodes in the propagation phase until reaching a certain time and then start the slaughter with maximum effort. We also show that in the optimal attack policy, the battery resources are used according to a decreasing function of time, i.e., most aggressively during the initial phase of the outbreak. Finally, our numerical investigations reveal a framework for identifying intelligent defense strategies that can limit the damage by appropriately selecting network parameters."}
