Specifications can be made more declarative and high level if syntactic details concerning bound variables and substitutions are encoded directly into the logic using term-level abstractions (Î»-abstraction) and proof-level abstractions (eigenvariables). When one wishes to use such logical theories to support reasoning about properties of computation, the usual quantifiers and proof-level abstractions do not seem adequate: proof-level abstraction of variables with scope over sequents (global scope) as well as over only formulas (local scope) seem required for many examples. We will present a sequent calculus that provides this local notion of proof-level abstraction via generic judgment and a new quantifier, âˆ\u2021, which explicitly manipulates such local scope. Intuitionistic logic extended with âˆ\u2021 satisfies cut-elimination even when the logic is additionally strengthened with a proof theoretic notion of definitions. The resulting logic can be used to encode naturally a number of examples involving abstractions, and we illustrate the uses of âˆ\u2021 with the Ï\u20AC-calculus and an encoding of provability of an object-logic."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11455","fieldValue":"&lambda;-tree syntax"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11455","fieldValue":"&lambda;-tree syntax"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11455","fieldValue":"&nabla;-quantifier"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11455","fieldValue":"&nabla;-quantifier"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11455","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11455","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11456","fieldValue":"Hughes, Dominic J D"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11456","fieldValue":"Van Glabbeek, Rob J."}
