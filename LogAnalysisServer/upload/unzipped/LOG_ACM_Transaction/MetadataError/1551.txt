Previous PRT approaches pre-compute light transport for a fixed scene and cannot account for cast shadows on high-glossy objects occluded by dynamic neighbors. In this paper, we extend double\/triple product integral to generalized multi-function product integral. We represent shading integral at each vertex as the product integral of multiple functions, involving the lighting, BRDF, local visibility and dynamic occlusions. Our main contribution is a new mathematical representation and analysis of multi-function product integral in the wavelet domain. We show that multi-function product integral in the primal corresponds to the summation of the product of basis coefficients and integral coefficients. We propose a novel generalized Haar integral coefficient theorem to evaluate arbitrary Haar integral coefficients. We present an efficient sub-linear algorithm to render dynamic glossy objects under time-variant all-frequency lighting and arbitrary view conditions in a few seconds on a commodity CPU, orders of magnitude faster than previous techniques. To further accelerate shadow computation, we propose a Just-in-time Radiance Transfer (JRT) technique. JRT is a new generalization to PRT for dynamic scenes. It is compact and flexible, and supports glossy materials. By pre-computing radiance transfer vectors at runtime, we demonstrate rendering dynamic view-dependent all-frequency shadows in real-time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15703","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15703","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15704","fieldValue":"Tsai, Yu-Ting"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15704","fieldValue":"Shih, Zen-Chung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15704","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a new data representation and compression technique for precomputed radiance transfer (PRT). The light transfer functions and light sources are modeled with spherical radial basis functions (SRBFs). A SRBF is a rotation-invariant function that depends on the geodesic distance between two points on the unit sphere. Rotating functions in SRBF representation is as straightforward as rotating the centers of SRBFs. Moreover, high-frequency signals are handled by adjusting the bandwidth parameters of SRBFs. To exploit inter-vertex coherence, the light transfer functions are further classified iteratively into disjoint clusters, and tensor approximation is applied within each cluster. Compared with previous methods, the proposed approach enables real-time rendering with comparable quality under high-frequency lighting environments. The data storage is also more compact than previous all-frequency PRT algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15704","fieldValue":"All-frequency precomputed radiance transfer using spherical radial basis functions and clustered tensor approximation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15704","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15704","fieldValue":"ACM"}
