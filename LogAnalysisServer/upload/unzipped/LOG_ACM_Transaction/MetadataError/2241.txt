Additive manufacturing methods involving low-cost 3D printers often require robust branching support structures to prevent material collapse at overhangs. Although the designed shape can successfully be made by adding supports, residual material remains at the contact points after the supports have been removed, resulting in unsightly surface artifacts. Moreover, fine surface details on the fabricated model can easily be damaged while removing supports. To prevent the visual impact of these artifacts, we present a method to find printing directions that avoid placing supports in perceptually significant regions. Our model for preference in 3D printing direction is formulated as a combination of metrics including area of support, visual saliency, preferred viewpoint and smoothness preservation. We develop a training-and-learning methodology to obtain a closed-form solution for our perceptual model and perform a large-scale study. We demonstrate the performance of this perceptual model on both natural and man-made objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17451","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17451","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17452","fieldValue":" We present an interactive design system that allows casual users to quickly create 3D-printable robotic creatures. Our approach automates the tedious parts of the design process while providing ample room for customization of morphology, proportions, gait and motion style. The technical core of our framework is an efficient optimization-based solution that generates stable motions for legged robots of arbitrary designs. An intuitive set of editing tools allows the user to interactively explore the space of feasible designs and to study the relationship between morphological features and the resulting motions. Fabrication blueprints are generated automatically such that the robot designs can be manufactured using 3D-printing and off-the-shelf servo motors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by designing six robotic creatures with a variety of morphological features: two, four or five legs, point or area feet, actuated spines and different proportions. We validate the feasibility of the designs generated with our system through physics simulations and physically-fabricated prototypes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17453","fieldValue":" We propose IM6D, a novel real-time magnetic motion-tracking system using multiple identifiable, tiny, lightweight, wireless and occlusion-free markers. It provides reasonable accuracy and update rates and an appropriate working space for dexterous 3D interaction. Our system follows a novel electromagnetic induction principle to externally excite wireless LC coils and uses an externally located pickup coil array to track each of the LC coils with 5-DOF. We apply this principle to design a practical motion-tracking system using multiple markers with 6-DOF and to achieve reliable tracking with reasonable speed. We also solved the principle's inherent dead-angle problem. Based on this method, we simulated the configuration of parameters for designing a system with scalability for dexterous 3D motion. We implemented an actual system and applied a parallel computation structure to increase the tracking speed. We also built some examples to show how well our system works for actual situations."}
