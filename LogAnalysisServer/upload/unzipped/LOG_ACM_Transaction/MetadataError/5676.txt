Computers and computer-related devices have the potential to help these children in education, career development, and independent living. Our understanding of computer usage by this population is quite limited. Most of the software, games, and Web sites that children with Down syndrome interact with are designed without consideration of their special needs, making the applications less effective or completely inaccessible. We conducted a large-scale survey that collected computer usage information from the parents of approximately six hundred children with Down syndrome. This article reports the text responses collected in the survey and is intended as a step towards understanding the difficulties children with Down syndrome experience while using computers. The relationship between the age and the specific type of difficulties, as well as related design challenges are also reported. A number of potential research directions and hypotheses are identified for future studies. Due to limitations in survey methodology, the findings need to be further validated through hypothesis-driven, empirical studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5071","fieldValue":" Identification of protein complexes is critical to understand complex formation and protein functions. Recent advances in high-throughput experiments have provided large data sets of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Many approaches, based on the assumption that complexes are dense subgraphs of PPI networks (PINs in short), have been proposed to predict complexes using graph clustering methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel from-function-to-interaction paradigm for protein complex detection. As proteins perform biological functions by forming complexes, we first cluster proteins using biology process (BP) annotations from gene ontology (GO). Then, we map the resulting protein clusters onto a PPI network (PIN in short), extract connected subgraphs consisting of clustered proteins from the PPI network and expand each connected subgraph with protein nodes that have rich links to the proteins in the subgraph. Such expanded subgraphs are taken as predicted complexes. We apply the proposed method (called CPredictor) to two PPI data sets of S. cerevisiae for predicting protein complexes. Experimental results show that CPredictor outperforms the existing methods. The outstanding precision of CPredictor proves that the from-function-to-interaction paradigm provides a new and effective way to computational detection of protein complexes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5071","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
