In addition to its openness, we have designed, GamingAnywhere for high extensibility, portability, and reconfigurability. We implemented it on Windows, Linux, OS X, and Android. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Our experimental results indicate that GamingAnywhere is efficient, scalable, adaptable to network conditions, and achieves high responsiveness and streaming quality. GamingAnywhere can be employed by researchers, game developers, service providers, and end users for setting up cloud gaming testbeds, which we believe, will stimulate more research into innovations for cloud gaming systems and applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25546","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25546","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25547","fieldValue":"Muntean, Gabriel-Miro"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25547","fieldValue":" As a step towards enhancing users' perceived multimedia quality levels, this article presents the results of a study which looked at user's perception of inter-stream synchronization between scent and video. The ability to detect and the perception of and impact of skew on user's quality of experience is analyzed considering user's age, sex, and culture (user profile). The results indicate that skews beyond a certain level between olfaction and video have a negative impact on user-perceived experience. Olfaction before video is more noticeable to users than olfaction after video, and assessors are more tolerable of olfactory data presented after video."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25547","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25548","fieldValue":" Different 3D tele-immersive (3DTI) activities pose different prioritized requirements for application and network-level quality of service (QoS) to ensure a strong quality of experience (QoE) for participants. Some applications put heavy weight on audio quality, some consider higher quality for upper body video streams, and some seek very low end-to-end interactivity delay. In addition, a variation in streaming content may arise in the 3DTI space due to the participants' change in interests (e.g., view change). Therefore, there is a need for an adaptive multistream, multisite 3DTI session management strategy that is not only unobtrusive, but also optimizes prioritized QoS parameters in 3DTI content distribution based on user activity and content variation. To address this next generation session management problem, we revisit the design space of multistream and multisite 3DTI session layer. We present an evolutionary 3DTI session optimization approach using Open Session Management (OSM) architecture that uses a global view of participants and overlays network conditions to optimize QoS parameters. Experimental results with PlanetLab traces show that our optimization process is unobtrusive, and the optimized TI sessions provide higher satisfaction to the participants (in some cases up to 50&percnt; higher) compared to the current solutions in the 3DTI space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25548","fieldValue":"ACM"}
