The expectation maximization algorithm is used to estimate the joint parameters of spline-based mixture regression models and prior transformation density models. The latter accounts for the variability in RT points and peak intensities. The applicability of PMRM for alignment of LC-MS data is demonstrated through three data sets. The performance of PMRM is compared with other alignment approaches including dynamic time warping, correlation optimized warping, and continuous profile model in terms of coefficient variation of replicate LC-MS runs and accuracy in detecting differentially abundant peptides\/proteins."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4661","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4661","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4661","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4662","fieldValue":" Microarray experiments are affected by several sources of variability.
