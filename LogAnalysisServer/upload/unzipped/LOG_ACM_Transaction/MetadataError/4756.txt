{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1259","fieldValue":" Autonomic computing systems are capable of adapting their behavior and resources thousands of times a second to automatically decide the best way to accomplish a given goal despite changing environmental conditions and demands. Different decision mechanisms are considered in the literature, but in the vast majority of the cases a single technique is applied to a given instance of the problem. This article proposes a comparison of some state of the art approaches for decision making, applied to a self-optimizing autonomic system that allocates resources to a software application. A variety of decision mechanisms, from heuristics to control-theory and machine learning, are investigated. The results obtained with these solutions are compared by means of case studies using standard benchmarks. Our results indicate that the most suitable decision mechanism can vary depending on the specific test case but adaptive and model predictive control systems tend to produce good performance and may work best in a priori unknown situations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3446","fieldValue":" Links between music and body motion can be studied through experiments called sound-tracing. One of the main challenges in such research is to develop robust analysis techniques that are able to deal with the multidimensional data that musical sound and body motion present. The article evaluates four different analysis methods applied to an experiment in which participants moved their hands following perceptual features of short sound objects. Motion capture data has been analyzed and correlated with a set of quantitative sound features using four different methods: (a) a pattern recognition classifier, (b) t-tests, (c) Spearman's Ï? correlation, and (d) canonical correlation. This article shows how the analysis methods complement each other, and that applying several analysis techniques to the same data set can broaden the knowledge gained from the experiment."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/3446","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2465780.2465783\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3446","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3446","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25327","fieldValue":"Liu, Sheng-Min"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25327","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a media adaptation framework for an immersive biofeedback system for stroke patient rehabilitation. In our biofeedback system, media adaptation refers to changes in audio\/visual feedback as well as changes in physical environment. Effective media adaptation frameworks help patients recover generative plans for arm movement with potential for significantly shortened therapeutic time. The media adaptation problem has significant challengesâ\u20AC\u201D(a) high dimensionality of adaptation parameter space; (b) variability in the patient performance across and within sessions; (c) the actual rehabilitation plan is typically a non-first-order Markov process, making the learning task hard. Our key insight is to understand media adaptation as a real-time feedback control problem. We use a mixture-of-experts based Dynamic Decision Network (DDN) for online media adaptation. We train DDN mixtures per patient, per session. The mixture models address two basic questionsâ\u20AC\u201D(a) given a specific adaptation suggested by the domain experts, predict the patient performance, and (b) given the expected performance, determine the optimal adaptation decision. The questions are answered through an optimality criterion based search on DDN models trained in previous sessions. We have also developed new validation metrics and have very good results for both questions on actual stroke rehabilitation data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25327","fieldValue":"ACM"}
