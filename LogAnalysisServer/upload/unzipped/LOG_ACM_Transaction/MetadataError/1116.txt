Conventional wavelet synopses that greedily minimize the overall root-mean-squared (i.e., L2-norm) error in the data approximation can suffer from important problems, including severe bias and wide variance in the quality of the data reconstruction, and lack of nontrivial guarantees for individual approximate answers. Thus, probabilistic thresholding schemes have been recently proposed as a means of building wavelet synopses that try to probabilistically control maximum approximation-error metrics (e.g., maximum relative error).A key open problem is whether it is possible to design efficient deterministic wavelet-thresholding algorithms for minimizing general, non-L2 error metrics that are relevant to approximate query processing systems, such as maximum relative or maximum absolute error. Obviously, such algorithms can guarantee better maximum-error wavelet synopses and avoid the pitfalls of probabilistic techniques (e.g., â\u20ACœbadâ\u20AC? coin-flip sequences) leading to poor solutions; in addition, they can be used to directly optimize the synopsis construction process for other useful error metrics, such as the mean relative error in data-value reconstruction. In this article, we propose novel, computationally efficient schemes for deterministic wavelet thresholding with the objective of optimizing general approximation-error metrics. We first consider the problem of constructing wavelet synopses optimized for maximum error, and introduce an optimal low polynomial-time algorithm for one-dimensional wavelet thresholding---our algorithm is based on a new Dynamic-Programming (DP) formulation, and can be employed to minimize the maximum relative or absolute error in the data reconstruction. Unfortunately, directly extending our one-dimensional DP algorithm to multidimensional wavelets results in a super-exponential increase in time complexity with the data dimensionality. Thus, we also introduce novel, polynomial-time approximation schemes (with tunable approximation guarantees) for deterministic wavelet thresholding in multiple dimensions. We then demonstrate how our optimal and approximate thresholding algorithms for maximum error can be extended to handle a broad, natural class of distributive error metrics, which includes several important error measures, such as mean weighted relative error and weighted Lp-norm error. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic data sets evaluate our novel optimization algorithms, and demonstrate their effectiveness against earlier wavelet-thresholding schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14367","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14367","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14368","fieldValue":" XPath 1.0 is a variable free language designed to specify paths between nodes in XML documents. Such paths can alternatively be specified in first-order logic. The logical abstraction of XPath 1.0, usually called Navigational or Core XPath, is not powerful enough to express every first-order definable path. In this article, we show that there exists a natural expansion of Core XPath in which every first-order definable path in XML document trees is expressible. This expansion is called Conditional XPath. It contains additional axis relations of the form (child::n[F])&plus;, denoting the transitive closure of the path expressed by child::n[F]. The difference with XPath's descendant::n[F] is that the path (child::n[F])&plus; is conditional on the fact that all nodes in between the start and end node of the path should also be labeled by n and should make the predicate F true. This result can be viewed as the XPath analogue of the expressive completeness of the relational algebra with respect to first-order logic."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14368","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14368","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14368","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14369","fieldValue":" Graphs have become increasingly important in modelling complicated structures and schemaless data such as chemical compounds, proteins, and XML documents. Given a graph query, it is desirable to retrieve graphs quickly from a large database via indices. In this article, we investigate the issues of indexing graphs and propose a novel indexing model based on discriminative frequent structures that are identified through a graph mining process. We show that the compact index built under this model can achieve better performance in processing graph queries. Since discriminative frequent structures capture the intrinsic characteristics of the data, they are relatively stable to database updates, thus facilitating sampling-based feature extraction and incremental index maintenance. Our approach not only provides an elegant solution to the graph indexing problem, but also demonstrates how database indexing and query processing can benefit from data mining, especially frequent pattern mining. Furthermore, the concepts developed here can be generalized and applied to indexing sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well."}
