Each offers significant theoretical and practical advantages. In this article, we show that you can model complex problems using a range of decision functions, including both rule-based and cost-based logic, and spanning different classes of information. We show how different types of decision functions can be designed using up to four classes of information. The choice of which information classes to use is a modeling choice, and requires making specific choices in the representation of the problem. We illustrate these ideas in the context of modeling military airlift, where simulation and optimization have been viewed as competing methodologies. Our goal is to show that these are simply different flavors of a series of integrated modeling strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24982","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24982","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24983","fieldValue":" Halton sequences have always been quite popular with practitioners, in part because of their intuitive definition and ease of implementation. However, in their original form, these sequences have also been known for their inadequacy to integrate functions in moderate to large dimensions, in which case (t,s)-sequences such as the Sobol' sequence are usually preferred. To overcome this problem, one possible approach is to include permutations in the definition of Halton sequencesâ\u20AC\u201Dthereby obtaining generalized Halton sequencesâ\u20AC\u201Dan idea that goes back to almost thirty years ago, and that has been studied by many researchers in the last few years. In parallel to these efforts, an important improvement in the upper bounds for the discrepancy of Halton sequences has been made by Atanassov in 2004. Together, these two lines of research have revived the interest in Halton sequences. In this article, we review different generalized Halton sequences that have been proposed recently, and compare them by means of numerical experiments. We also propose a new generalized Halton sequence which, we believe, offers a practical advantage over the surveyed constructions, and that should be of interest to practitioners."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24984","fieldValue":" The goal of traffic engineering is to achieve a target Quality of Service (QoS) while maximizing network utilization. While determining the QoS for end-to-end paths in a network under self-similar traffic models is difficult, end-to-end network performance analysis is still essential in providing QoS to networks such as Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. The Fast Importance Sampling based Traffic Engineering (FISTE) approach proposed in this article is a prediction-based approach that maps the ingress traffic levels of a network to the QoS of end-to-end path(s) in the network. Because FISTE is a hybrid of simulation analysis and closed-form analysis, it can treat a complex network as a black box. When we combined Simulated Annealing (SA) with FISTE, the resulting approach can provide a traffic engineering solution so that multiple end-to-end QoS requirements are satisfied while the network resource utilization is maximized. FISTE originated from the concept of Importance Sampling (IS), and our approach differs from the previous Importance Sampling based approaches since this is the first time that IS is applied to multi-queue systems under Fractional Gaussian Noise (FGN) input and traffic engineering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24984","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24984","fieldValue":"ACM"}
