{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8258","fieldValue":" Keyword-based search engine advertising markets on the Internet, referred to as Sponsored Search Markets (SSMs), have reduced entry barriers to advertising for niche players. Known empirical research, though scant and emerging, suggests that while these markets provided niche firms with greater access, they do exhibit high levels of concentrationâ\u20AC\u201Da phenomenon that warrants further study. This research, using agent-based simulation of SSM, investigates the role of â\u20ACœmarket rulesâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœadvertiser practicesâ\u20AC? in generating emergent click share heterogeneity among advertisers in an industry. SSMs often rank ads based on the click-through rate (CTR) that gives rise to reinforcing dynamics at an individual keyword level. In the presence of spillovers arising from advertisersâ\u20AC™ practice of managing keyword bids with a cost cap operating on the keyword portfolio, these reinforcing dynamics can endogenously generate industry-level concentration. Analysis of counterfactual markets with different window sizes used to compute CTR reveals that industry-level concentration bears an inverted-â\u20ACœUâ\u20AC? relationship with window size."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8258","fieldValue":"Systemic Concentration in Sponsored Search Markets: The Role of Time Window in Click-Through-Rate Computation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8259","fieldValue":"Tsai, Ming-Feng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8259","fieldValue":"Wang, Chuan-Ju"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8259","fieldValue":"Chien, Po-Chuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8259","fieldValue":" The growing amount of public financial data makes it increasingly important to learn how to discover valuable information for financial decision making. This article proposes an approach to discovering financial keywords from a large number of financial reports. In particular, we apply the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model, a well-known continuous-space language model, to the textual information in 10-K financial reports to discover new finance keywords. In order to capture word meanings to better locate financial terms, we also present a novel technique to incorporate syntactic information into the CBOW model. Experimental results on four prediction tasks using the discovered keywords demonstrate that our approach is effective for discovering predictability keywords for post-event volatility, stock volatility, abnormal trading volume, and excess return predictions. We also analyze the discovered keywords that attest to the ability of the proposed method to capture both syntactic and contextual information between words. This shows the success of this method when applied to the field of finance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8259","fieldValue":"ACM"}
