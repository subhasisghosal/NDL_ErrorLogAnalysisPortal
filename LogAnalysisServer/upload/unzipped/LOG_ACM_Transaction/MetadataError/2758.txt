{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19155","fieldValue":" Tensors (also known as multidimensional arrays or N-way arrays) are used in a variety of applications ranging from chemometrics to psychometrics. We describe four MATLAB classes for tensor manipulations that can be used for fast algorithm prototyping. The tensor class extends the functionality of MATLAB's multidimensional arrays by supporting additional operations such as tensor multiplication. The tensor&lowbar;as&lowbar;matrix class supports the â\u20ACœmatricizationâ\u20AC? of a tensor, that is, the conversion of a tensor to a matrix (and vice versa), a commonly used operation in many algorithms. Two additional classes represent tensors stored in decomposed formats: cp&lowbar;tensor and tucker&lowbar;tensor. We describe all of these classes and then demonstrate their use by showing how to implement several tensor algorithms that have appeared in the literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19155","fieldValue":"MATLAB"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19155","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19155","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19156","fieldValue":" The quest for reliable integration of initial value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a long-standing problem in numerical analysis. At one end of the reliability spectrum are fixed stepsize methods implemented using standard floating point, where the onus lies entirely with the user to ensure the stepsize chosen is adequate for the desired accuracy. At the other end of the reliability spectrum are rigorous interval-based methods, that can provide provably correct bounds on the error of a numerical solution. This rigour comes at a price, however: interval methods are generally two to three orders of magnitude more expensive than fixed stepsize floating-point methods. Along the spectrum between these two extremes lie various methods of different expense that estimate and control some measure of the local errors and adjust the stepsize accordingly. In this article, we continue previous investigations into a class of interpolants for use in Runge-Kutta methods that have a defect function whose qualitative behavior is asymptotically independent of the problem being integrated. In particular the point, in a step, where the maximum defect occurs as h â\u2020\u2019 0 is known a priori. This property allows the defect to be monitored and controlled in an efficient and robust manner even for modestly large stepsizes. Our interpolants also have a defect with the highest possible order given the constraints imposed by the order of the underlying discrete formula. We demonstrate the approach on three Runge-Kutta methods of orders 5, 6, and 8, and provide Fortran and preliminary Matlab interfaces to these three new integrators. We also consider how sensitive such methods are to roundoff errors. Numerical results for four problems on a range of accuracy requests are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19157","fieldValue":" The practical calculation of range bounds for some complex standard functions is addressed in this article. The functions under consideration are root and power functions, the exponential, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and their inverse functions. For such a function f and a given rectangular complex interval z, some interval w is computed that contains all function values of f in z. This is done by expressing the real and the imaginary part of f as compositions of real standard functions and then estimating the ranges of these compositions. In many cases, the inclusions are optimal, such that w is the smallest rectangular interval containing the range of f.
