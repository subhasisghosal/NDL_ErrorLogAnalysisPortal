It has become a vital part of human social life in both the developed and developing world. People sharing certain similarities or affiliates tend to form communities within social media. At the same time, they participate in various online activities: content sharing, tagging, posting status updates, etc. These diverse activities leave behind traces of their social life, providing clues to understand changing social structures. A large body of existing work focuses on extracting cohesive groups based on network topology. But little attention is paid to understanding the changing social structures. In order to help explain the formation of a group, we explore different group-profiling strategies to construct descriptions of a group. This research can assist network navigation, visualization, and analysis, as well as monitoring and tracking the ebbs and tides of different groups in evolving networks. By exploiting information collected from real-world social media sites, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate group-profiling results. The pros and cons of different group-profiling strategies are analyzed with concrete examples. We also show some potential applications based on group profiling. Interesting findings with discussions are reported."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7380","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7380","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7381","fieldValue":" Statistical bilingual word alignment has been well studied in the field of machine translation. This article adapts the bilingual word alignment algorithm into a monolingual scenario to extract collocations from monolingual corpus, based on the fact that the words in a collocation tend to co-occur in similar contexts as in bilingual word alignment. First, the monolingual corpus is replicated to generate a parallel corpus, in which each sentence pair consists of two identical sentences. Next, the monolingual word alignment algorithm is employed to align potentially collocated words. Finally, the aligned word pairs are ranked according to the alignment scores and candidates with higher scores are extracted as collocations. We conducted experiments on Chinese and English corpora respectively. Compared to previous approaches that use association measures to extract collocations from co-occurrence word pairs within a given window, our method achieves higher precision and recall. According to human evaluation, our method achieves precisions of 62&percnt; on a Chinese corpus and 64&percnt; on an English corpus. In particular, we can extract collocations with longer spans, achieving a higher precision of 83&percnt; on the long-span (> 6 words) Chinese collocations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7381","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7381","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1671","fieldValue":" Modern computer systems are called on to deal with billions of events every second, whether they are executed instructions, accessed memory locations, or forwarded packets. This presents a serious challenge to those who seek to quantify, analyze, or optimize such systems, because important trends and behaviors may easily be lost in a sea of data. We present range-adaptive profiling (RAP) as a new and general-purpose profiling method capable of hierarchically efficiently classifying streams of data in hardware. Through the use of RAP, events in an input stream are dynamically classified into increasingly precise categories, based on the frequency with which they occur. The more important a class, or range of events, the more precisely it is quantified. Despite the dynamic nature of our technique, we build upon tight theoretic bounds covering both worst-case error, as well as the required memory. In the limit, it is known that error and the memory bounds can be independent of the stream size and grow only linearly with the level of precision desired. Significantly, we expose the critical constants in these algorithms and through careful engineering, algorithm redesign, and use of heuristics, we show how a high-performance profile system can be implemented for range-adaptive profiling. RAP can be used on various profiles, such as PCs, load values, and memory addresses, and has a broad range of uses, from hot-region profiling to quantifying cache miss value locality. We propose two methods of implementation of RAP, one in software and the other with specialized hardware, for which we also describe our prototype FPGA implementation. We show that with just 8KB of memory, range profiles can be gathered with an average accuracy of 98&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7382","fieldValue":" Query suggestion plays an important role in improving usability of search engines. Although some recently proposed methods provide query suggestions by mining query patterns from search logs, none of them models the immediately preceding queries as context systematically, and uses context information effectively in query suggestions. Context-aware query suggestion is challenging in both modeling context and scaling up query suggestion using context. In this article, we propose a novel context-aware query suggestion approach. To tackle the challenges, our approach consists of two stages. In the first, offline model-learning stage, to address data sparseness, queries are summarized into concepts by clustering a click-through bipartite. A concept sequence suffix tree is then constructed from session data as a context-aware query suggestion model. In the second, online query suggestion stage, a userâ\u20AC™s search context is captured by mapping the query sequence submitted by the user to a sequence of concepts. By looking up the context in the concept sequence suffix tree, we suggest to the user context-aware queries. We test our approach on large-scale search logs of a commercial search engine containing 4.0 billion Web queries, 5.9 billion clicks, and 1.87 billion search sessions. The experimental results clearly show that our approach outperforms three baseline methods in both coverage and quality of suggestions."}
