However, the input buffers of a NoC router often take a significant portion of the silicon area and power consumption. Besides, the performance of a NoC is also greatly affected by the buffer size. In this article, a static buffer merging and resource sharing method is proposed for the application-specific SoC minimizing the NoC buffer. When given an application-specific task graph and the dataflow distribution, the proposed method statically merges rarely used buffers and generates the suitable number of input buffers for each router at design timely. The merged buffer is shared by several input directions. The experimental result shows that the buffer can be utilized more effectively after the resource sharing. Based on the synthesized design with TSMC 90nm technology, the proposed method reduces an average of 42.23&percnt; area and 35.13&percnt; power while providing similar performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13392","fieldValue":"Power and Area Efficiency NoC Router Design for Application-Specific SoC by Using Buffer Merging and Resource Sharing"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13392","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13392","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13393","fieldValue":"Wunderlich, Hans-Joachim"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13393","fieldValue":" As the technology shrinks, nonfunctional properties (NFPs) such as reliability, vulnerability, power consumption, or heat dissipation become as important as system functionality. As NFPs often influence each other, depend on the application and workload of a system, and exhibit nonlinear behavior, NFP simulation over long periods of system operation is computationally expensive, if feasible at all. This article presents a piecewise evaluation method for efficient NFP simulation. Simulation time is divided into intervals called evaluation windows, within which the NFP models are partially linearized. High-speed functional system simulation is achieved by parallel execution of models at different levels of abstraction. A trade-off between simulation speed and accuracy is met by adjusting the size of the evaluation window. As an example, the piecewise evaluation technique is applied to analyze aging caused by two mechanisms, namely Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI), in order to identify reliability hotspots. Experiments show that the proposed technique yields considerable simulation speedup at a marginal loss of accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13393","fieldValue":"ACM"}
