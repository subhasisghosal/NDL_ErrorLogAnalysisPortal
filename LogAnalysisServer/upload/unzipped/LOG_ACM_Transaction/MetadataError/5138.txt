Accurate reproduction of virtual sound sources can only be experienced in the sweet spot, which is located equidistant to the loudspeakers. We here present a novel methodology to compensate audio systems such that the channel similarity is optimized in several listening positions simultaneously. To that end we propose a novel MIMO personal audio filter design framework based on feed-forward control. By proper design choices, filters that successfully compensate for multiple off-axis positions and irregularities in the frequency sum responses are obtained. The design choices include allpass filters with appropriate phase shifts as target for each listening position in addition to a weighted similarity requirement. Evaluations based on measurements of two four-channel car audio systems show that the proposed method significantly improves timbral sound reproduction and phantom center reproduction in several listening positions simultaneously."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4003","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4004","fieldValue":" This paper presents an index designed to predict music quality for individuals listening through hearing aids. The index is \"intrusive,\" that is, it compares the degraded signal being evaluated to a reference signal. The index is based on a model of the auditory periphery that includes the effects of hearing loss. Outputs from the auditory model are used to measure changes in the signal time-frequency envelope modulation, temporal fine structure, and long-term spectrum caused by the hearing aid processing. The index is constructed by combining a term sensitive to noise and nonlinear distortion with a second term sensitive to changes in the long-term spectrum. The index is fitted to an existing database of music quality judgments made by listeners having normal or impaired hearing. The data comprise ratings for three music excerpts (classical orchestra, jazz trio, and jazz singer), each processed through 100 conditions representative of hearing-aid processing and listening situations. The overall accuracy of the index is high, with a correlation coefficient of 0.970 when computed over all of the processing conditions and averaged over the combined groups of listeners having normal and impaired hearing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4004","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4004","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.relation.haspart","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_HASPART","handle":"12345678_acm\/1002","fieldValue":"[{\"visible\":false,\"sortKey\":\"MarchDec 1993\",\"expandable\":true,\"handle\":\"12345678_acm\/1007\",\"title\":\"Issue 1-4, MarchDec 1993\"}]"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1030","fieldValue":" Static analysis of programs is indispensable to any software tool, environment, or system that requires compile-time information about the semantics of programs. With the emergence of languages like C and LISP, static analysis of programs with dynamic storage and recursive data structures has become a field of active research. Such analysis is difficult, and the static-analysis community has recognized the need for simplifying assumptions and approximate solutions. However, even under the common simplifying assumptions, such analyses are harder than previously recognized. Two fundamental static-analysis problems are may alias and must alias. The former is not recursive (is undecidable), and the latter is not recursively enumerable (is uncomputable), even when all paths are executable in the program being analyzed for languages with if statements, loops, dynamic storage, and recursive data structures."}
