As a consequence, a new semi-partitioning algorithm that uses a static Rate-Monotonic criterion to schedule real-time tasks on multi-core platforms is proposed. The improvement in the performance of real-time systems is achieved by exploitingthe fact that the utilization boundary of a task set increases to fully utilize the processors if the periods of tasks have harmonic nature among each other. Experimental results on randomly generated datasets and real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm inevitably outperforms other competitive algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7042","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7042","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7043","fieldValue":"Wu, Chin-Hsien"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7043","fieldValue":"Chen, Syuan-An"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7043","fieldValue":" In the storage systems of NAND flash memory, an intermediate software called a Flash Translation Layer (FTL) is adopted to hide the characteristics of NAND flash memory and provide efficient management for NAND flash memory. Current flash translation layers can be classified into a page-mapping FTL, a block-mapping FTL, and a hybrid-mapping FTL. In order to utilize the advantages of the page-mapping FTL and the block-mapping FTL, the hybrid-mapping FTL is proposed to store data to the appropriate mapping mechanism by switching the mapping information between the page-mapping mechanism and the block-mapping mechanism. In the article, we propose a joint operation mechanism to rethink the advantages of the page-mapping FTL, the block-mapping FTL, and the hybrid-mapping FTL. With the joint operation mechanism, a flash translation layer can consider the main memory requirements, improve the system performance, and reduce the garbage collection overhead. The experimental results show that the proposed joint operation mechanism can achieve the goal under realistic workloads and benchmarks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7044","fieldValue":" Interpolation is the most executed operation and one of the main bottlenecks in embedded imaging, registration, and rendering systems. Existing methods either lack parallelization and scalability capabilities or are too computationally complex to execute efficiently. Acknowledging that improving execution time leads to degradation in image quality, we formulate a novel Negative Squared Distance (NSD) interpolation method that exhibits excellent performance by exploiting Look-Up Table (LUT) optimization for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) speedup, with a balanced trade-off in quality in our embedded endomicroscopic imaging system. Quantitative analysis on performance and resource utilization of NSD against existing methods is reported through an implementation on a Xilinx ML605 platform. Functional validation using practical image resizing and rotation applications to compare qualitative performance against existing algorithms is performed and presented with visual and numerical results. Our method is shown to have a smaller design size and produces a maximum throughput of over twofold against trilinear interpolation with on-par image quality as the baseline method."}
