The efficiency of FPGA clock networks can be improved by reducing this flexibility; however, reducing the flexibility introduces stricter constraints during the clustering and placement stages of the FPGA CAD flow. These constraints can reduce the overall efficiency of the final implementation. This article examines the trade-off between the power consumption and flexibility of FPGA clock networks. Specifically, this article makes three contributions. First, it presents a new parameterized clock-network framework for describing and comparing FPGA clock networks. Second, it describes new clock-aware placement techniques that are needed to find a legal placement satisfying the constraints imposed by the clock network. Finally, it performs an empirical study to examine the trade-off between the power consumption of the clock network and the impact of the CAD constraints for a number of different clock networks with varying amounts of flexibility. The results show that the techniques used to produce a legal placement can have a significant influence on power and the ability of the placer to find a legal solution. On average, circuits placed using the most effective techniques dissipate 5&percnt; less overall energy and are significantly more likely to be legal than circuits placed using other techniques. Moreover, the results show that the architecture of the clock network is also important. On average, FPGAs with an efficient clock network are up to 14.6&percnt; more energy efficient compared to other FPGAs."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21699","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21699","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21699","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21700","fieldValue":" This article presents the design of a generic HyperTransport (HT) core. HyperTransport is a packet-based interconnect technology for low-latency, high-bandwidth point-to-point connections. It is specially optimized to achieve a very low latency. The core has been verified in system using an FPGA. This exhaustive verification and the generic design allow the mapping to both ASICs and FPGAs. The implementation described in this work supports a 16-bit link width, as used by Opteron processors. On a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX60, the core supports a link frequency of 400 MHz DDR and offers a maximum bidirectional bandwidth of 3.2GB\/s. The in-system verification has been performed using a custom FPGA board that has been plugged into a HyperTransport extension connector (HTX) of a standard Opteron-based motherboard. HTX slots in Opteron-based motherboards allow very high-bandwidth, low-latency communication, since the HTX device is directly connected to one of the HyperTransport links of the processor. Performance analysis shows a unidirectional payload bandwidth of 1.4GB\/s and a read latency of 180 ns. The HT core in combination with the HTX board is an ideal base for prototyping systems and implementing FPGA coprocessors. The HT core is available as open source."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21700","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21700","fieldValue":"HTX"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21700","fieldValue":"RTL"}
