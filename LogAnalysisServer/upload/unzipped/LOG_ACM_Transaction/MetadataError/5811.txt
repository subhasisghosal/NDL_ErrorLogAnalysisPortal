{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5326","fieldValue":" The biological function of a macromolecule often requires that a small molecule or ion is transported through its structure. The transport pathway often leads through void spaces in the structure. The properties of transport pathways change significantly in time; therefore, the analysis of a trajectory from molecular dynamics rather than of a single static structure is needed for understanding the function of pathways. The identification and analysis of transport pathways are challenging because of the high complexity and diversity of macromolecular shapes, the thermal motion of their atoms, and the large amount of conformations needed to properly describe conformational space of protein structure. In this paper, we describe the principles of the CAVER 3.0 algorithms for the identification and analysis of properties of transport pathways both in static and dynamic structures. Moreover, we introduce the improved clustering solution for finding tunnels in macromolecules, which is included in the latest CAVER 3.02 version. Voronoi diagrams are used to identify potential pathways in each snapshot of a molecular dynamics trajectory and clustering is then used to find the correspondence between tunnels from different snapshots. Furthermore, the geometrical properties of pathways and their evolution in time are computed and visualized."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5326","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5326","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5326","fieldValue":"CAVER"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5327","fieldValue":" High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies allow fast and affordable sequencing of individual genomes and thus enable unprecedented studies of genetic variations. Information about variations in the genome of an individual is provided by haplotypes, ordered collections of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Knowledge of haplotypes is instrumental in finding genes associated with diseases, drug development, and evolutionary studies. Haplotype assembly from high-throughput sequencing data is challenging due to errors and limited lengths of sequencing reads. The key observation made in this paper is that the minimum error-correction formulation of the haplotype assembly problem is identical to the task of deciphering a coded message received over a noisy channel---a classical problem in the mature field of communication theory. Exploiting this connection, we develop novel haplotype assembly schemes that rely on the bit-flipping and belief propagation algorithms often used in communication systems. The latter algorithm is then adapted to the haplotype assembly of polyploids. We demonstrate on both simulated and experimental data that the proposed algorithms compare favorably with state-of-the-art haplotype assembly methods in terms of accuracy, while being scalable and computationally efficient."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5327","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5327","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5327","fieldValue":"ACM"}
