To do so, we first characterize the achievable edge-rate region, that is, the set of edge rates that are achievable on the given topology. This requires a careful consideration of the interdependence among edges since neighboring edges collide with and affect the idle time perceived by the edge under study. We approach this problem in two steps. First, we consider two-edge topologies and study the fundamental ways they interact. Then, we consider arbitrary multihop topologies, compute the effect that each neighboring edge has on the edge under study in isolation, and combine to get the aggregate effect. We then use the characterization of the achievable edge-rate region to characterize the achievable rate region. We verify the accuracy of our analysis by comparing the achievable rate region derived from simulations with the one derived analytically. We make a couple of interesting and somewhat surprising observations while deriving the rate regions. First, the achievable rate region with 802.11 scheduling is not necessarily convex. Second, the performance of 802.11 is surprisingly good. For example, in all the topologies used for model verification, the max-min allocation under 802.11 is at least 64% of the max-min allocation under a perfect scheduler."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9895","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9895","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9895","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9896","fieldValue":" In this paper, we characterize the performance of an important class of scheduling schemes, called greedy maximal scheduling (GMS), for multihop wireless networks. While a lower bound on the throughput performance of GMS has been well known, empirical observations suggest that it is quite loose and that the performance of GMS is often close to optimal. In this paper, we provide a number of new analytic results characterizing the performance limits of GMS. We first provide an equivalent characterization of the efficiency ratio of GMS through a topological property called the local-pooling factor of the network graph. We then develop an iterative procedure to estimate the local-pooling factor under a large class of network topologies and interference models. We use these results to study the worst-case efficiency ratio of GMS on two classes of network topologies. We show how these results can be applied to tree networks to prove that GMS achieves the full capacity region in tree networks under the K-hop interference model. Then, we show that the worst-case efficiency ratio of GMS in geometric unit-disk graphs is between 1\/6 and 1\/3."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9896","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9896","fieldValue":"Understanding the capacity region of the Greedy maximal scheduling algorithm in multihop wireless networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9896","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9896","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9897","fieldValue":" We consider the delay properties of one-hop networks with general interference constraints and multiple traffic streams with time-correlated arrivals. We first treat the case when arrivals are modulated by independent finite state Markov chains. We show that the well known maximal scheduling algorithm achieves average delay that grows at most logarithmically in the largest number of interferers at any link. Further, in the important special case when each Markov process has at most two states (such as bursty ON\/OFF sources), we prove that average delay is independent of the number of nodes and links in the network, and hence is order-optimal. We provide tight delay bounds in terms of the individual auto-correlation parameters of the traffic sources. These are perhaps the first order-optimal delay results for controlled queueing networks that explicitly account for such statistical information. Our analysis treats cases both with and without flow control."}
