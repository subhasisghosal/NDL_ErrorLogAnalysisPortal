Our system does this by probabilistic optimization based on parameters obtained from a database of tree models. The best matching model is selected by comparing its 2D projections with the sketch. Branch interaction is modeled by a Markov random field, subject to the constraint of 3D projection to sketch. Our system then uses the notion of self-similarity to add new branches before finally populating all branches with leaves of the user's choice. We show a variety of natural-looking tree models generated from freehand sketches with only a few strokes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2515","fieldValue":" We define and design succinct indexes for several abstract data types (ADTs). The concept is to design auxiliary data structures that ideally occupy asymptotically less space than the information-theoretic lower bound on the space required to encode the given data, and support an extended set of operations using the basic operators defined in the ADT. The main advantage of succinct indexes as opposed to succinct (integrated data\/index) encodings is that we make assumptions only on the ADT through which the main data is accessed, rather than the way in which the data is encoded. This allows more freedom in the encoding of the main data. In this article, we present succinct indexes for various data types, namely strings, binary relations and multilabeled trees. Given the support for the interface of the ADTs of these data types, we can support various useful operations efficiently by constructing succinct indexes for them. When the operators in the ADTs are supported in constant time, our results are comparable to previous results, while allowing more flexibility in the encoding of the given data. Using our techniques, we design a succinct encoding that represents a string of length n over an alphabet of size σ using $nH_k(S) + lg σ · o(n) + O(n lg σ\/lg lg lg σ) bits to support access\/rank\/select operations in o((lg lg $σ)^1+&epsi;) time, for any fixed constant &epsi; > 0. We also design a succinct text index using n H0$(S) + O(n lg σ\/lg lg σ) bits that supports finding all the occ occurrences of a given pattern of length m in O(m lg lg σ + occ lg n\/lg&epsi;$ σ) time, for any fixed constant 0 < &epsi; < 1. Previous results on these two problems either have a lg σ factor instead of lg lg σ in the running time, or are not compressed. Finally, we present succinct encodings of binary relations and multi-labeled trees that are more compact than previous structures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15978","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15978","fieldValue":" We introduce a volumetric space-time technique for the reconstruction of moving and deforming objects from point data. The output of our method is a four-dimensional space-time solid, made up of spatial slices, each of which is a three-dimensional solid bounded by a watertight manifold. The motion of the object is described as an incompressible flow of material through time. We optimize the flow so that the distance material moves from one time frame to the next is bounded, the density of material remains constant, and the object remains compact. This formulation overcomes deficiencies in the acquired data, such as persistent occlusions, errors, and missing frames. We demonstrate the performance of our flow-based technique by reconstructing coherent sequences of watertight models from incomplete scanner data."}
