Current practice is to use descriptors such as medical diagnoses to represent a personâ\u20AC™s physical capabilities. This solution is not adequate due to similarities in functional capabilities between diagnoses as well as differences in capabilities within a diagnosis. An alternative is user self-reporting or observation by another person, but these solutions can be problematic because they rely on individual interpretations of capabilities and may introduce unwanted bias. The current research focuses on defining an objective, quantifiable, repeatable, and efficient methodology for assessing an individualâ\u20AC™s physical capabilities in relation to use of information technologies. Thirty-one users with a range of physical capabilities participated in the evaluation of the proposed performance-based functional assessment methodology. Building on the current standard for such assessments, multiple observers provided independent assessments that served as the gold standard for comparison. Promising metrics produced through the performance-based assessment were identified through comparisons with these observer evaluations. Predictive models were then generated via regression and correlation analysis. The models were validated using a three-fold validation process. Results from this initial research are encouraging, with the resulting models explaining up to 92&percnt; of the variance in user capabilities. Directions for future research are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1430","fieldValue":"HCI"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1430","fieldValue":"The Development and Evaluation of Performance-Based Functional Assessment: A Methodology for the Measurement of Physical Capabilities"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1430","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1430","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5034","fieldValue":" Detecting local common sequence-structure regions of RNAs is a biologically important problem. Detecting such regions allows biologists to identify functionally relevant similarities between the inspected molecules. We developed dynamic programming algorithms for finding common structure-sequence patterns between two RNAs. The RNAs are given by their sequence and a set of potential base pairs with associated probabilities. In contrast to prior work on local pattern matching of RNAs, we support the breaking of arcs. This allows us to add flexibility over matching only fixed structures; potentially matching only a similar subset of specified base pairs. We present an $O(n^3) algorithm for local exact pattern matching between two nested RNAs, and an O(n3 log n) algorithm for one nested RNA and one bounded-unlimited RNA. In addition, an algorithm for approximate pattern matching is introduced that for two given nested RNAs and a number k, finds the maximal local pattern matching score between the two RNAs with at most k mismatches in O(n3k2) time. Finally, we present an O(n3$) algorithm for finding the most similar subforest between two nested RNAs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5034","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5034","fieldValue":"ACM"}
