This survey reviews 100&plus; recent articles on content-based multimedia information retrieval and discusses their role in current research directions which include browsing and search paradigms, user studies, affective computing, learning, semantic queries, new features and media types, high performance indexing, and evaluation techniques. Based on the current state of the art, we discuss the major challenges for the future."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25251","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25251","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25252","fieldValue":" In the past few years, there has been an increasing availability of technologies for the acquisition of digital 3D models of real objects and the consequent use of these models in a variety of applications, in medicine, engineering, and cultural heritage. In this framework, content-based retrieval of 3D objects is becoming an important subject of research, and finding adequate descriptors to capture global or local characteristics of the shape has become one of the main investigation goals. In this article, we present a comparative analysis of a few different solutions for description and retrieval by similarity of 3D models that are representative of the principal classes of approaches proposed. We have developed an experimental analysis by comparing these methods according to their robustness to deformations, the ability to capture an object's structural complexity, and the resolution at which models are considered."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25253","fieldValue":"Chua, Tat-Seng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25253","fieldValue":" The use of AV features alone is insufficient to induce high-level semantics. This article proposes a framework that utilizes both internal AV features and various types of external information sources for event detection in team sports video. Three schemes are also proposed to tackle the asynchronism between the fusion of AV and external information. The framework is extensible as it can provide increasing functionalities given more detailed external information and domain knowledge. By demonstrating its effectiveness on soccer and American football, we believe that with the availability of appropriate domain knowledge, the framework is applicable to other team sports."}
