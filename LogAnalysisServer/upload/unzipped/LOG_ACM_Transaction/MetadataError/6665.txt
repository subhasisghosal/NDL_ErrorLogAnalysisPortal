Plenty of valuable information is accumulated based on the check-in behaviors, which makes it possible to learn usersâ\u20AC™ moving patterns as well as their preferences. In LBSNs, point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of the most significant tasks because it can help targeted users explore their surroundings as well as help third-party developers provide personalized services. Matrix factorization is a promising method for this task because it can capture usersâ\u20AC™ preferences to locations and is widely adopted in traditional recommender systems such as movie recommendation. However, the sparsity of the check-in data makes it difficult to capture usersâ\u20AC™ preferences accurately. Geographical influence can help alleviate this problem and have a large impact on the final recommendation result. By studying usersâ\u20AC™ moving patterns, we find that users tend to check in around several centers and different users have different numbers of centers. Based on this, we propose a Multi-center Gaussian Model (MGM) to capture this pattern via modeling the probability of a userâ\u20AC™s check-in on a location. Moreover, users are usually more interested in the top 20 or even top 10 recommended POIs, which makes personalized ranking important in this task. From previous work, directly optimizing for pairwise ranking like Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) achieves better performance in the top-k recommendation than directly using matrix matrix factorization that aims to minimize the point-wise rating error. To consider usersâ\u20AC™ preferences, geographical influence and personalized ranking, we propose a unified POI recommendation framework, which unifies all of them together. Specifically, we first fuse MGM with matrix factorization methods and further with BPR using two different approaches. We conduct experiments on Gowalla and Foursquare datasets, which are two large-scale real-world LBSN datasets publicly available online. The results on both datasets show that our unified POI recommendation framework can produce better performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7745","fieldValue":"Choi, Kup-Sze"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7745","fieldValue":" The knowledge-leverage-based Takagi--Sugeno--Kang fuzzy system (KL-TSK-FS) modeling method has shown promising performance for fuzzy modeling tasks where transfer learning is required. However, the knowledge-leverage mechanism of the KL-TSK-FS can be further improved. This is because available training data in the target domain are not utilized for the learning of antecedents and the knowledge transfer mechanism from a source domain to the target domain is still too simple for the learning of consequents when a Takagi--Sugeno--Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) model is trained in the target domain. The proposed method, that is, the enhanced KL-TSK-FS (EKL-TSK-FS), has two knowledge-leverage strategies for enhancing the parameter learning of the TSK-FS model for the target domain using available information from the source domain. One strategy is used for the learning of antecedent parameters, while the other is for consequent parameters. It is demonstrated that the proposed EKL-TSK-FS has higher transfer learning abilities than the KL-TSK-FS. In addition, the EKL-TSK-FS has been further extended for the scene of the multisource domain."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7745","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7745","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7746","fieldValue":" Semantic tags of points of interest (POIs) are a crucial prerequisite for location search, recommendation services, and data cleaning. However, most POIs in location-based social networks (LBSNs) are either tag-missing or tag-incomplete. This article aims to develop semantic annotation techniques to automatically infer tags for POIs. We first analyze two LBSN datasets and observe that there are two types of tags, category-related ones and sentimental ones, which have unique characteristics. Category-related tags are hierarchical, whereas sentimental ones are category-aware. All existing related work has adopted classification methods to predict high-level category-related tags in the hierarchy, but they cannot apply to infer either low-level category tags or sentimental ones. In light of this, we propose a latent-class probabilistic generative model, namely the spatial-temporal topic model (STM), to infer personal interests, the temporal and spatial patterns of topics\/semantics embedded in usersâ\u20AC™ check-in activities, the interdependence between category-topic and sentiment-topic, and the correlation between sentimental tags and rating scores from usersâ\u20AC™ check-in and rating behaviors. Then, this learned knowledge is utilized to automatically annotate all POIs with both category-related and sentimental tags in a unified way. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed STM on a real large-scale dataset. The experimental results show the superiority of our proposed STM, and we also observe that the real challenge of inferring category-related tags for POIs lies in the low-level ones of the hierarchy and that the challenge of predicting sentimental tags are those with neutral ratings."}
