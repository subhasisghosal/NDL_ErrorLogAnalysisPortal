{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4177","fieldValue":" Homology search is a key tool for understanding the role, structure, and biochemical function of genomic sequences. The most popular technique for rapid homology search is blast, which has been in widespread use within universities, research centers, and commercial enterprises since the early 1990s. In this paper, we propose a new step in the blast algorithm to reduce the computational cost of searching with negligible effect on accuracy. This new stepÂ¿semigapped alignmentÂ¿compromises between the efficiency of ungapped alignment and the accuracy of gapped alignment, allowing blast to accurately filter sequences with lower computational cost. In addition, we propose a heuristicÂ¿restricted insertion alignmentÂ¿that avoids unlikely evolutionary paths with the aim of reducing gapped alignment cost with negligible effect on accuracy. Together, after including an optimization of the local alignment recursion, our two techniques more than double the speed of the gapped alignment stages in blast. We conclude that our techniques are an important improvement to the blast algorithm.

Future grids will integrate a wide variety of heterogeneous producers and consumers that are unpredictable and operate at various scales. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions will have to control these in order to attain global objectives at the macrolevel, while also considering private interests at the microlevel. This article proposes a generic holonic architecture to help the development of ICT control systems that meet these requirements. We show how this architecture can integrate heterogeneous control designs, including state-of-the-art smart grid solutions. To illustrate the applicability and utility of this generic architecture, we exemplify its use via a concrete proof-of-concept implementation for a holonic controller, which integrates two types of control solutions and manages a multiscale, multiobjective grid simulator in several scenarios. We believe that the proposed contribution is essential for helping to understand, to reason about, and to develop the â\u20ACœsmartâ\u20AC? side of future power grids."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1317","fieldValue":"A Generic Holonic Control Architecture for Heterogeneous Multiscale and Multiobjective Smart Microgrids"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1317","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1317","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4178","fieldValue":" The rates-across-sites assumption in phylogenetic inference posits that the rate matrix governing the Markovian evolution of a character on an edge of the putative phylogenetic tree is the product of a character-specific scale factor and a rate matrix that is particular to that edge. Thus, evolution follows basically the same process for all characters, except that it occurs faster for some characters than others. To allow estimation of tree topologies and edge lengths for such models, it is commonly assumed that the scale factors are not arbitrary unknown constants, but rather unobserved, independent, identically distributed draws from a member of some parametric family of distributions. A popular choice is the gamma family. We consider an example of a clock-like tree with three taxa, one unknown edge length, a known root state, and a parametric family of scale factor distributions that contains the gamma family. This model has the property that, for a generic choice of unknown edge length and scale factor distribution, there is another edge length and scale factor distribution which generates data with exactly the same distribution, so that even with infinitely many data it will be typically impossible to make correct inferences about the unknown edge length."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4178","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
