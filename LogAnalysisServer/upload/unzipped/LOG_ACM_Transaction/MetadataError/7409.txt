{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9629","fieldValue":" Two important requirements for future backbone networks are full survivability against link failures and dynamic bandwidth provisioning. We demonstrate how these two requirements can be met by introducing a new survivable network concept called the Generalized Survivable Network (GSN), which has the special property that it remains survivable no matter how traffic is provisioned dynamically, as long as the input and output constraints at the nodes are fixed. A rigorous mathematical framework for designing the GSN is presented. In particular, we focus on the GSN Capacity Planning Problem, which finds the edge capacities for a given physical network topology with the input\/output constraints at the nodes. We employ fixed single-path routing which leads to wide-sense nonblocking GSNs. We show how the initial, infeasible formal mixed integer linear programming formulation can be transformed into a more feasible problem using the duality transformation. A procedure for finding the realizable lower bound for the cost is also presented. A two-phase approach is proposed for solving the GSNCPP. We have carried out numerical computations for ten networks with different topologies and found that the cost of a GSN is only a fraction (from 39% to 97%) more than the average cost of a static survivable network. The framework is applicable to survivable network planning for ASTN\/ASON, VPN, and IP networks as well as bandwidth-on-demand resource allocation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9629","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9629","fieldValue":"ASON"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9629","fieldValue":"ASTN"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9629","fieldValue":"VPN"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9629","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9629","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9630","fieldValue":"Resende, Mauricio G C"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9630","fieldValue":" In a large backbone network, the routers often have multiple egress points they could use to direct traffic toward an external destination. Today's routers select the \"closest\" egress point, based on the intradomain routing configuration, in a practice known as early-exit or hot-potato routing. In this paper, we argue that hot-potato routing is restrictive, disruptive, and convoluted and propose an alternative called TIE (Tunable Interdomain Egress selection). TIE is a flexible mechanism that allows routers to select the egress point for each destination prefix based on both the intradomain topology and the goals of the network administrators. In fact, TIE is designed from the start with optimization in mind, to satisfy diverse requirements for traffic engineering and network robustness. We present two example optimization problems that use integer-programming and multicommodity-flow techniques, respectively, to tune the TIE mechanism to satisfy networkwide objectives. Experiments with traffic, topology, and routing data from two backbone networks demonstrate that our solution is both simple (for the routers) and expressive (for the network administrators)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9630","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
