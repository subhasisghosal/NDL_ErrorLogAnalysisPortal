This operation is typically carried out by solving a Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, which smoothly interpolates the discrepancies between the boundary of the source patch and the target across the entire cloned area. In this paper we introduce an alternative, coordinate-based approach, where rather than solving a large linear system to perform the aforementioned interpolation, the value of the interpolant at each interior pixel is given by a weighted combination of values along the boundary. More specifically, our approach is based on Mean-Value Coordinates (MVC). The use of coordinates is advantageous in terms of speed, ease of implementation, small memory footprint, and parallelizability, enabling real-time cloning of large regions, and interactive cloning of video streams. We demonstrate a number of applications and extensions of the coordinate-based framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16105","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16105","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16106","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present SkyFinder, an interactive search system of over a half million sky images downloaded from the Internet. Using a set of automatically extracted, semantic sky attributes (category, layout, richness, horizon, etc.), the user can find a desired sky image, such as \"a landscape with rich clouds at sunset\" or \"a whole blue sky with white clouds\". The system is fully automatic and scalable. It computes all sky attributes offline, then provides an interactive online search engine. Moreover, we build a sky graph based on the sky attributes, so that the user can smoothly explore and find a path within the space of skies. We also show how our system can be used for controllable sky replacement."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16106","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16106","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16107","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16107","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present Paint Selection, a progressive painting-based tool for local selection in images. Paint Selection facilitates users to progressively make a selection by roughly painting the object of interest using a brush. More importantly, Paint Selection is efficient enough that instant feedback can be provided to users as they drag the mouse. We demonstrate that high quality selections can be quickly and effectively \"painted\" on a variety of multi-megapixel images."}
