The methods capitalize on Chandy and Sherman's space-time relaxation paradigm, and incorporate fast algorithms for solving recurrences. Special attention is paid to implementing these algorithms on currently available massively parallel SIMD computers. As examples, â\u20ACœsuperfastâ\u20AC? simulations for open and closed queuing networks and for the slotted ALOHA communication protocol are discussed. Several of the simulations are implemented and show impressive computational speeds. This paper summarizes previous results of the authors and presents some new experiments and simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24755","fieldValue":" An efficient discontinuity handling algorithm for initial value problems in differential-algebraic equations is presented. The algorithm supports flexible representation of state conditions in propositional logic, and guarantees the location of all state events in strict time order. The algorithm consists of two phases:(1) event detection and(2) consistent event location. In the event detection phase, the entire integration step is searched for the state event by solving the interpolation polynomials for the discontinuity functions generated by the BDF method. An efficient hierarchical polynomial root-finding procedure based upon interval arithmetic guarantees detection of the state event even if multiple state condition transitions exist in an integration step, in which case many existing algorithms may fail. As a second phase of the algorithm, a consistent even location calculation is developed that accurately locates the state event detected earlier while completely eliminating incorrect reactivation of the same state event immediately after the consistent initialization calculation that may follow. This numerical phenomenon has not been explained before and is termed discontinuity sticking. Results from various test problems are presented to demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of the algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24755","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24755","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24756","fieldValue":" For discrete distributions a variant of reject from a continuous hat function is presented. The main advantage of the new method, called rejection-inversion, is that no extra uniform random number to decide between acceptance and rejection is required, which means that the expected number of uniform variates required is halved. Using rejection-inversion and a squeeze, a simple universal method for a large class of monotone discrete distributions is developed. It can be used to generate variates from the tails of most standard discrete distributions. Rejection-inversion applied to the Zipf (or zeta) distribution results in algorithms that are short and simple and at least twice as fast as the fastest methods suggested in the literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24756","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24756","fieldValue":"ACM"}
