This restriction is due to the static nature of the acceleration structures used. While the best reported frame rates for static geometric models have been achieved using carefully constructed kd-trees, this article shows that bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) can be used to efficiently ray trace large static models.More importantly, the BVH can be used to ray trace deformable models (sets of triangles whose positions change over time) with little loss of performance. A variety of efficiency techniques are used to achieve this performance, but three algorithmic changes to the typical BVH algorithm are mainly responsible. First, the BVH is built using a variant of the surface area heuristic conventionally used to build kd-trees. Second, the topology of the BVH is not changed over time so that only the bounding volumes need to be refit from frame-to-frame. Third, and most importantly, packets of rays are traced together through the BVH using a novel integrated packet-frustum traversal scheme. This traversal scheme elegantly combines the advantages of both packet traversal and frustum traversal and allows for rapid hierarchy descent for packets that hit bounding volumes as well as rapid exits for packets that miss. A BVH-based ray tracing system using these techniques is shown to achieve performance for deformable models comparable to that previously available only for static models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15750","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15750","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15751","fieldValue":" Selecting the most important regions of a surface is useful for shape matching and a variety of applications in computer graphics and geometric modeling. While previous research has analyzed geometric properties of meshes in isolation, we select regions that distinguish a shape from objects of a different type. Our approach to analyzing distinctive regions is based on performing a shape-based search using each region as a query into a database. Distinctive regions of a surface have shape consistent with objects of the same type and different from objects of other types. We demonstrate the utility of detecting distinctive surface regions for shape matching and other graphics applications including mesh visualization, icon generation, and mesh simplification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15752","fieldValue":"Wu, Tai-Pang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15752","fieldValue":"Tang, Chi-Keung"}
