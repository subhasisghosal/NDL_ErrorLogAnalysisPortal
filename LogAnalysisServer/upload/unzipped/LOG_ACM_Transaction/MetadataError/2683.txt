After many years of development, homotopy path trackers based on probability-one homotopy methods are reliable and fast. Now, theoretical advances reducing the number of homotopy paths that must be tracked, and in the handling of singular solutions, have made probability-one homotopy methods even more practical. POLSYS_PLP consists of Fortran 90 modules for finding all isolated solutions of a complex coefficient polynomial system of equations. The package is intended to be used in conjunction with HOMPACK90 (Algorithm 777), and makes extensive use of Fortran 90 derived data types to support a partitioned linear product (PLP) polynomial system structure. PLP structure is a generalization of m-homogeneous structure, whereby each component of the system can have a different m-homogeneous structure. The code requires a PLP structure as input, and although finding the optimal PLP structure is a difficult combinatorial problem, generally physical or engineering intuition about a problem yields a very good structure. POLSYS_PLP employs a sophisticated power series end game for handling singular solutions, and provides support for problem definition both at a high level and via hand-crafted code.

To this end, we describe our novel open infrastructure for building and executing home applications. This includes the amalgamation of the two computing areas of autonomics and service orientation, to produce a component-based platform providing facilities including monitoring, touchpoints, and other common autonomic services. This infrastructure uniquely blends the advantages of distributed autonomic control with global conflict management in a management hierarchy. We discuss this platform in terms of pervasive home systems and show how one would develop such a system for two examples of automated home applications: intruder detection and medical support, respectively. Both applications were built within our framework and evaluated showing that the use of the framework introduces minimal overheads but provides many benefits. We then conclude by highlighting the contributions of AutoHome and a discussion about the lessons learned, limitations, and future research directions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/1202","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"1921641.1921649\"}"}
