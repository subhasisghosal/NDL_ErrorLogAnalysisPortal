{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13212","fieldValue":" Stream cipher is an important class of encryption algorithm that encrypts plaintext messages one bit at a time. Various stream ciphers are deployed in wireless telecommunication applications because they have simple hardware circuitry, are generally fast and consume very low power. On the other hand, scan-based Design-for-Test (DFT) is one of the most popular methods to test IC devices. All flip-flops in the Design Under Test are connected to one or more scan chains and the states of the flip-flops can be scanned out through these chains. In this paper, we present an attack on stream cipher implementations by determining the scan chain structure of the Linear Feedback Shift Registers in their implementations. Although scan-based DFT is a powerful testing scheme, we show that it can be used to retrieve the information stored in a crypto chip thus compromising its theoretically proven security."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13212","fieldValue":"LFSR"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13212","fieldValue":"RFID"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13212","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13212","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2259","fieldValue":" We introduce the class of nested polynomially recurrent sequences which includes a large number of sequences that are of combinatorial interest. We present an algorithm for deciding zero equivalence of these sequences, thereby providing a new algorithm for proving identities among combinatorial sequences: In order to prove an identity, decide by the algorithm whether the difference of lefthand-side and righthand-side is identically zero. This algorithm is able to treat mathematical objects which are not covered by any other known symbolic method for proving combinatorial identities. Despite its theoretical flavor and high complexity, an implementation of the algorithm can be successfully applied to nontrivial examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13213","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13213","fieldValue":"ACM"}
