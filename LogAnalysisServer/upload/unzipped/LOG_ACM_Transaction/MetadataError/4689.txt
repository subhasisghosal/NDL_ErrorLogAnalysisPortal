{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25108","fieldValue":" The model-based methods have recently found widespread applications in solving hard nondifferentiable optimization problems. These algorithms are population-based and typically require hundreds of candidate solutions to be sampled at each iteration. In addition, recent convergence analysis of these algorithms also stipulates a sample size that increases polynomially with the number of iterations. In this article, we aim to improve the efficiency of model-based algorithms by reducing the number of candidate solutions generated per iteration. This is carried out through embedding a stochastic averaging procedure within these methods to make more efficient use of the past sampling information. This procedure not only can potentially reduce the number of function evaluations needed to obtain high-quality solutions, but also makes the underlying algorithms more amenable for parallel computation. The detailed implementation of our approach is demonstrated through an exemplary algorithm instantiation called Model-based Annealing Random Search with Stochastic Averaging (MARS-SA), which maintains the per iteration sample size at a small constant value. We establish the global convergence property of MARS-SA and provide numerical examples to illustrate its performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25108","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3429","fieldValue":" In natural vision both stimulus features and cognitive\/affective factors influence an observer's attention. However, the relationship between stimulus-driven (bottom-up) and cognitive\/affective (top-down) factors remains controversial: How well does the classic visual salience model account for gaze locations&quest; Can emotional salience counteract strong visual stimulus signals and shift attention allocation irrespective of bottom-up features&quest; Here we compared Itti and Koch's [2000] and Spectral Residual (SR) visual salience model and explored the impact of visual salience and emotional salience on eye movement behavior, to understand the competition between visual salience and emotional salience and how they affect gaze allocation in complex scenes viewing. Our results show the insufficiency of visual salience models in predicting fixation. Emotional salience can override visual salience and can determine attention allocation in complex scenes. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that cognitive\/affective factors play a dominant role in active gaze control."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3429","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3429","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25109","fieldValue":"Hong, L Jeff"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25109","fieldValue":" Value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are two widely used risk measures of large losses and are employed in the financial industry for risk management purposes. In practice, loss distributions typically do not have closed-form expressions, but they can often be simulated (i.e., random observations of the loss distribution may be obtained by running a computer program). Therefore, Monte Carlo methods that design simulation experiments and utilize simulated observations are often employed in estimation, sensitivity analysis, and optimization of VaRs and CVaRs. In this article, we review some of the recent developments in these methods, provide a unified framework to understand them, and discuss their applications in financial risk management."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25109","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25109","fieldValue":"ACM"}
