Before doing so, keys for performing encryption and authentication must be agreed upon by the communicating parties. Due to resource constraints, however, achieving key agreement in wireless sensor networks is nontrivial. Many key agreement schemes used in general networks, such as Diffie-Hellman and other public-key based schemes, are not suitable for wireless sensor networks due to the limited computational abilities of the sensor nodes. Predistribution of secret keys for all pairs of nodes is not viable due to the large amount of memory this requires when the network size is large.In this paper, we provide a framework in which to study the security of key predistribution schemes, propose a new key predistribution scheme which substantially improves the resilience of the network compared to previous schemes, and give an in-depth analysis of our scheme in terms of network resilience and associated overhead. Our scheme exhibits a nice threshold property: when the number of compromised nodes is less than the threshold, the probability that communications between any additional nodes are compromised is close to zero. This desirable property lowers the initial payoff of smaller-scale network breaches to an adversary, and makes it necessary for the adversary to attack a large fraction of the network before it can achieve any significant gain."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22190","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22190","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3116","fieldValue":" The lack of computational support has significantly slowed down automatic understanding of endangered languages. In this paper, we take Nyushu (simplified Chinese: å¥³ä¹¦; literally: â\u20ACœwomenâ\u20AC™s writingâ\u20AC?) as a case study to present the first computational approach that combines Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing techniques to deeply understand an endangered language. We developed an end-to-end system to read a scanned hand-written Nyushu article, segment it into characters, link them to standard characters, and then translate the article into Mandarin Chinese. We propose several novel methods to address the new challenges introduced by noisy input and low resources, including Nyushu-specific feature selection for character segmentation and linking, and character linking lattice based Machine Translation. The end-to-end system performance indicates that the system is a promising approach and can serve as a standard benchmark."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3116","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3116","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22191","fieldValue":"Van Renesse, Robbert"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22191","fieldValue":" APSS, a proactive secret sharing (PSS) protocol for asynchronous systems, is explained and proved correct. The protocol enables a set of secret shares to be periodically refreshed with a new, independent set, thereby thwarting mobile-adversary attacks. Protocols for asynchronous systems are inherently less vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, which slow processor execution or delay message delivery. So APSS tolerates certain attacks that PSS protocols for synchronous systems cannot."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22191","fieldValue":"ACM"}
