This has motivated the recent surge of research in cooperative and dynamic-spectrum-access (which we also refer to as cognitive spectrum access) networks. Still, as of today, a key open research challenge is to design distributed control strategies to dynamically jointly assign: 1) portions of the spectrum and 2) cooperative relays to different traffic sessions to maximize the resulting network-wide data rate. In this paper, we make a significant contribution in this direction. First, we mathematically formulate the problem of joint spectrum management and relay selection for a set of sessions concurrently utilizing an interference-limited infrastructure-less wireless network. We then study distributed solutions to this (nonlinear and nonconvex) problem. The overall problem is separated into two subproblems: 1) spectrum management through power allocation with given relay selection strategy; and 2) relay selection for a given spectral profile. Distributed solutions for each of the two subproblems are proposed, which are then analyzed based on notions from variational inequality (VI) theory. The distributed algorithms can be proven to converge, under certain conditions, to VI solutions, which are also Nash equilibrium (NE) solutions of the equivalent NE problems. A distributed algorithm based on iterative solution of the two subproblems is then designed. Performance and price of anarchy of the distributed algorithm are then studied by comparing it to the globally optimal solution obtained with a newly designed centralized algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed algorithm achieves performance that is within a few percentage points of the optimal solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10921","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10921","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10922","fieldValue":" In several data center settings, each arriving job may only be served by one of a subset of servers. Such a graph constraint can arise due to several reasons. One is locality of the data needed by a job; for example, in content farms (e.g., in Netflix or YouTube) a video request can only be served by a machine that possesses a copy. Motivated by this, we consider a setting where each job, on arrival, reveals a deadline and a subset of servers that can serve it. The job needs to be immediately allocated to one of these servers, and cannot be moved thereafter. Our objective is to maximize the fraction of jobs that are served before their deadlines. For this online load balancing problem, we prove an upper bound of 1---1\/e on the competitive ratio of nonpreemptive online algorithms for systems with a large number of servers. We propose an algorithm - INSERT RANKING - which achieves this upper bound. The algorithm makes decisions in a correlated random way and it is inspired by the work of Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani on online matching for bipartite graphs. We also show that two more natural algorithms, based on independent randomness, are strictly suboptimal, with a competitive ratio of 1\/2."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10922","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10922","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}
