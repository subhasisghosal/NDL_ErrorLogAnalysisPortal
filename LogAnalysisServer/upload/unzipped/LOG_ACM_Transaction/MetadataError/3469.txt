We show how the amount of information captured at a PoI is affected by the proportion q\/p, the time interval p over which the proportion is achieved, the event type in terms of its stochastic arrival dynamics and staying times and the utility function. The periodic PoI sensor schedule happens in two broad contexts. In the case of static sensors, a sensor monitoring a PoI may be periodically turned off to conserve energy, thereby extending the lifetime of the monitoring until the sensor can be recharged or replaced. In the case of mobile sensors, a sensor may move between the PoIs in a repeating visit schedule. In this case, the PoIs may vary in importance, and the scheduling objective is to distribute the sensor's coverage time in proportion to the importance levels of the PoIs. Based on our QoM analysis, we optimize a class of periodic mobile coverage schedules that can achieve such proportional sharing while maximizing the QoM of the total system."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21350","fieldValue":"Quality of monitoring of stochastic events by periodic and proportional-share scheduling of sensor coverage"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21351","fieldValue":" The fundamental WSN requirement to be energy-efficient has produced a whole range of specialized Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols. They differ in how performance (latency, throughput) is traded off for a reduction in energy consumption. The question â\u20ACœwhich protocol is best&quest;â\u20AC? is difficult to answer because (i) this depends on specific details of the application requirements and hardware characteristics involved, and (ii) protocols have mainly been assessed individually with each outperforming the canonical S-MAC protocol, but with different simulators, hardware platforms, and workloads. This article addresses that void for low data-rate applications where collisions are of little concern, making an analytical approach tractable in which latency and energy consumption are modeled as a function of key protocol parameters (duty cycle, slot length, number of slots, etc.). By exhaustive search we determine the Pareto-optimal protocol settings for a given workload (data rate, network topology). Of the protocols compared we find that WiseMAC strikes the best latency vs. energy-consumption trade-off across the range of workloads considered. In particular, its random access scheme in combination with local synchronization does not only minimize protocol overhead, but also maximizes the available channel bandwidth."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21351","fieldValue":"ACM"}
