Transmit power allocation not only affects network lifetime and throughput, but also determines localization accuracy. In this paper, we present an optimization framework for robust power allocation in network localization with imperfect knowledge of network parameters. In particular, we formulate power allocation problems to minimize localization errors for a given power budget and show that such formulations can be solved via conic programming. Moreover, we design a distributed power allocation algorithm that allows parallel computation among agents. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform uniform power allocation, and the robust schemes outperform their non-robust counterparts when the network parameters are subject to uncertainty."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10543","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10543","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10543","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10544","fieldValue":" Capabilities-based networks present a fundamental shift in the security design of network architectures. Instead of permitting the transmission of packets from any source to any destination, routers deny forwarding by default. For a successful transmission, packets need to positively identify themselves and their permissions to the router. A major challenge for a high-performance implementation of such a network is an efficient design of the credentials that are carried in the packet and the verification procedure on the router. We present a capabilities system that uses packet credentials based on Bloom filters. The credentials are of fixed length (independent of the number of routers that are traversed by the packet) and can be verified by routers with a few simple operations. This high-performance design of capabilities makes it feasible that traffic is verified on every router in the network, and most attack traffic can be contained within a single hop. We present an analysis of our design and a practical protocol implementation that can effectively limit unauthorized traffic with only a small per-packet overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10544","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10544","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10544","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1961","fieldValue":"Yew, Pen-Chung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1961","fieldValue":" As multicore and many-core architectures evolve, their memory systems are becoming increasingly more complex. To bridge the latency and bandwidth gap between the processor and memory, they often use a mix of multilevel private\/shared caches that are either blocking or nonblocking and are connected by high-speed network-on-chip. Moreover, they also incorporate hardware and software prefetching and simultaneous multithreading (SMT) to hide memory latency. On such multi- and many-core systems, to incorporate various memory optimization schemes using compiler optimizations and performance tuning techniques, it is crucial to have microarchitectural details of the target memory system. Unfortunately, such details are often unavailable from vendors, especially for newly released processors. In this article, we propose a novel microbenchmarking methodology based on short elapsed-time events (SETEs) to obtain comprehensive memory microarchitectural details in multi- and many-core processors. This approach requires detailed analysis of potential interfering factors that could affect the intended behavior of such memory systems. We lay out effective guidelines to control and mitigate those interfering factors. Taking the impact of SMT into consideration, our proposed methodology not only can measure traditional cache\/memory latency and off-chip bandwidth but also can uncover the details of software and hardware prefetching units not attempted in previous studies. Using the newly released Intel Xeon Phi many-core processor (with in-order cores) as an example, we show how we can use a set of microbenchmarks to determine various microarchitectural features of its memory system (many are undocumented from vendors). To demonstrate the portability and validate the correctness of such a methodology, we use the well-documented Intel Sandy Bridge multicore processor (with out-of-order cores) as another example, where most data are available and can be validated. Moreover, to illustrate the usefulness of the measured data, we do a multistage coordinated data prefetching case study on both Xeon Phi and Sandy Bridge and show that by using the measured data, we can achieve 1.3X and 1.08X performance speedup, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art Intel ICC compiler. We believe that these measurements also provide useful insights into memory optimization, analysis, and modeling of such multicore and many-core architectures."}
