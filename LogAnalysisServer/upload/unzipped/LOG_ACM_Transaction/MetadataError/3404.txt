{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21177","fieldValue":" An ad-hoc wireless sensor network-based system is presented that detects and accurately locates shooters even in urban environments. The localization accuracy of the system in open terrain is competitive with that of existing centralized countersniper systems. However, the presented sensor network-based solution surpasses the traditional approach because it can mitigate acoustic multipath effects prevalent in urban areas and it can also resolve multiple simultaneous shots. These unique characteristics of the system are made possible by employing novel sensor fusion techniques that utilize the spatial and temporal diversity of multiple detections. In this article, in addition to the overall system architecture, the middleware services and the unique sensor fusion algorithms are described. An analysis of the experimental data gathered during field trials at US military facilities is also presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21177","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21177","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21178","fieldValue":"Prabh, K Shashi"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21178","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks hold a very promising future. The nodes of wireless sensor networks (WSN) have a small energy supply and limited bandwidth available. Since radio communication is expensive in terms of energy consumption, the nodes typically spend most of their energy reserve on wireless communication (rather than on CPU processing) for data dissemination and retrieval. Therefore, the role of energy conserving data communication protocols and services in WSN can not be overemphasized. Caching data at locations that minimize packet transmissions in the network reduces the power consumption in the network, and hence extends its lifetime. Finding locations of the nodes for caching data to minimize communication cost corresponds to finding the nodes of a weighted Minimum Steiner tree whose edge weights depend on the edge's Euclidean length and its data traffic rate. We call this tree a Steiner Data Caching Tree (SDCT). We prove that an optimal SDCT is binary, and that at-least two of the three internal angles formed at the Steiner points are equal. We derive expressions that determine the exact location of a Steiner point for a set of three nodes based on their location and their data refresh rate requirements. Based on these (optimality) results, we present a dynamic distributed energy-conserving application-layer service for data caching and asynchronous multicast. We present the results of simulation of our service that verifies its power saving properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21178","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21178","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21179","fieldValue":" Pairwise key establishment is a fundamental security service for sensor networks. However, establishing pairwise keys in sensor networks is a challenging problem, particularly due to the resource constraints on sensor nodes and the threat of node compromises. This article proposes to use both predeployment and postdeployment knowledge to improve pairwise key predistribution in static sensor networks. By exploiting the predeployment knowledge, this article first develops two key predistribution schemes, a closest pairwise keys scheme and a closest polynomials scheme. The analysis shows that these schemes can achieve better performance if the expected location information is available and that the smaller the deployment error is, the better performance they can achieve. The article then investigates how to use postdeployment knowledge to improve pairwise key predistribution in static sensor networks. The idea is to load an excessive amount of predistributed keys on sensor nodes, prioritize these keys based on sensors' actual locations discovered after deployment, and discard low-priority keys to thwart node compromise attacks. This approach is then used to improve the random subset assignment scheme proposed recently to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. The analysis indicates that the postdeployment knowledge can also greatly improve the performance and security of key predistribution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21179","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21179","fieldValue":"ACM"}
