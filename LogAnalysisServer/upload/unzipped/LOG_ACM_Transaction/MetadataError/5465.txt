The proteins of the ion channels of cardiomyocytes represent an important family of biological components determining the physiology of the heart. Some computational studies aiming to understand the mechanisms of the ion channels of cardiomyocytes have concentrated on Markovian stochastic approaches. Mathematically, these approaches employ Chapman-Kolmogorov equations coupled with partial differential equations. As the scale and complexity of such subcellular and cellular models increases, the balance between efficiency and accuracy of algorithms becomes critical. We have developed a novel two-stage splitting algorithm to address efficiency and accuracy issues arising in such modeling and simulation scenarios. Numerical experiments were performed based on the incorporation of our newly developed conformational kinetic model for the rapid delayed rectifier potassium channel into the dynamic models of human ventricular myocytes. Our results show that the new algorithm significantly outperforms commonly adopted adaptive Runge-Kutta methods. Furthermore, our parallel simulations with coupled algorithms for multicellular cardiac tissue demonstrate a high linearity in the speedup of large-scale cardiac simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4694","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4694","fieldValue":"Cardiomyocyte, arrhythmia, channel protein, conformation, kinetic pathway, differential equations, Markov model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4694","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4695","fieldValue":" We introduce a class of finite systems models of gene regulatory networks exhibiting behavior of the cell cycle. The network is an extension of a Boolean network model. The system spontaneously cycles through a finite set of internal states, tracking the increase of an external factor such as cell mass, and also exhibits checkpoints in which errors in gene expression levels due to cellular noise are automatically corrected. We present a 7-gene network based on Projective Geometry codes, which can correct, at every given time, one gene expression error. The topology of a network is highly symmetric and requires using only simple Boolean functions that can be synthesized using genes of various organisms. The attractor structure of the Boolean network contains a single cycle attractor. It is the smallest nontrivial network with such high robustness. The methodology allows construction of artificial gene regulatory networks with the number of phases larger than in natural cell cycle."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4695","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4695","fieldValue":"ACM"}
