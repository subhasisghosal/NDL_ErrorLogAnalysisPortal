The basis vectors spanning this space are constructed from a scale-adaptive image decomposition, based on kernels of the bilateral filter. Each of these vectors locally binds together pixels in smooth regions and leaves pixels across edges independent. Despite the drastic reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, this representation can be used to perform a number of recent gradient-based tonemapping techniques. In addition to reducing computation time, this space can prevent the bleeding artifacts which are common to Poisson-based integration methods. In addition, we show that this reduced representation is useful for energy-minimization methods in achieving efficient processing and providing better matrix conditioning at a minimal quality sacrifice."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2537","fieldValue":" In a Content Distribution Network (CDN), there are m servers storing the data; each of them has a specific bandwidth. All the requests from a particular client should be assigned to one server because of the routing protocol used. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these assignmentsâ\u20AC\u201Dcost of each is proportional to the distance between the client and the server as well as the request sizeâ\u20AC\u201Dwhile the load on each server is kept below its bandwidth limit. When each server also has a setup cost, this is an unsplittable hard-capacitated facility location problem. As much attention as facility location problems have received, there has been no nontrivial approximation algorithm when we have hard capacities (i.e., there can only be one copy of each facility whose capacity cannot be violated) and demands are unsplittable (i.e., all the demand from a client has to be assigned to a single facility). We observe it is NP-hard to approximate the cost to within any bounded factor in this case. Thus, for an arbitrary constant &epsi;>0, we relax the capacities to a 1+&epsi; factor. For the case where capacities are almost uniform, we give a bicriteria O(log n, 1+&epsi;)-approximation algorithm for general metrics and a (1+&epsi;, 1+&epsi;)-approximation algorithm for tree metrics. A bicriteria (Î±,Î²)-approximation algorithm produces a solution of cost at most Î± times the optimum, while violating the capacities by no more than a Î² factor. We can get the same guarantees for nonuniform capacities if we allow quasipolynomial running time. In our algorithm, some clients guess the facility they are assigned to, and facilities decide the size of the clients they serve. A straightforward approach results in exponential running time. When costs do not satisfy metricity, we show that a 1.5 violation of capacities is necessary to obtain any approximation. It is worth noting that our results generalize bin packing (zero connection costs and facility costs equal to one), knapsack (single facility with all costs being zero), minimum makespan scheduling for related machines (all connection costs being zero), and some facility location problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2537","fieldValue":"PTAS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16221","fieldValue":" Many applications in computer graphics require detailed 3D digital models of real-world environments. The automatic and semi-automatic modeling of such spaces presents several fundamental challenges. In this work, we present an easy and robust camera-based acquisition approach for the modeling of 3D scenes which is a significant departure from current methods. Our approach uses a novel pose-free formulation for 3D reconstruction. Unlike self-calibration, omitting pose parameters from the acquisition process implies no external calibration data must be computed or provided. This serves to significantly simplify acquisition, to fundamentally improve the robustness and accuracy of the geometric reconstruction given noise in the measurements or error in the initial estimates, and to allow using uncalibrated active correspondence methods to obtain robust data. Aside from freely taking pictures and moving an uncalibrated digital projector, scene acquisition and scene point reconstruction is automatic and requires pictures from only a few viewpoints. We demonstrate how the combination of these benefits has enabled us to acquire several large and detailed models ranging from 0.28 to 2.5 million texture-mapped triangles."}
