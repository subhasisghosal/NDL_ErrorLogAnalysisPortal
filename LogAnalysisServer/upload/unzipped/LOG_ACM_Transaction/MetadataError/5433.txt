In this contribution, we focus on the first three items, and, in particular, on the development of a new method for the hierarchical genome-wide and ontology-wide gene function prediction. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the â\u20ACœtrue path ruleâ\u20AC? (TPR) that governs both the Gene Ontology and FunCat taxonomies. According to this rule, the proposed TPR ensemble method is characterized by a two-way asymmetric flow of information that traverses the graph-structured ensemble: positive predictions for a node influence in a recursive way its ancestors, while negative predictions influence its offsprings. Cross-validated results with the model organism S. Crevisiae, using seven different sources of biomolecular data, and a theoretical analysis of the the TPR algorithm show the effectiveness and the drawbacks of the proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4635","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4635","fieldValue":"Gene function prediction, ensemble methods, hierarchical classification, Functional Catalogue (FunCat)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4635","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4635","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4636","fieldValue":" The NP-hard gene-duplication problem takes as input a collection of gene trees and seeks a species tree that requires the fewest number of gene duplications to reconcile the input gene trees. An oft-cited, decade-old result by Stege states that the gene-duplication problem is fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the number of gene duplications necessary for the reconciliation. Here, we uncover an error in this fixed parameter algorithm and show that this error cannot be corrected without sacrificing the fixed parameter tractability of the algorithm. Furthermore, we show a link between the gene-duplication problem and the minimum rooted triplets inconsistency problem which implies that the gene-duplication problem is 1) W[2]-hard when parameterized by the number of gene duplications necessary for the reconciliation and 2) hard to approximate to better than a logarithmic factor."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4636","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4636","fieldValue":"ACM"}
