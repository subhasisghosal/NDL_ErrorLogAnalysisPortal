In this paper, we propose a methodology for scheduling of packets, in the context of these technology limitations. If the total tolerable delay through a packet switch is at least on the order of the switch configuration delay, we show that a near 100% utilization of the communication links is possible, while providing strict quality of service guarantees. The main idea is to increase the quantum with which data is scheduled and switched to beyond that of a single packet. This also decreases the rate at which scheduling need to be made, and hence decreases the implementation complexity. The quality of service guarantees we consider are in terms of a service curve. Specifically, we present a framework for the provision of service curves while coping with non-negligible switch configuration delays."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9712","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9712","fieldValue":"MEMS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9712","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9713","fieldValue":" An iterative switching algorithm for an input queued switch consists of a number of iterations in every time step, where each iteration computes a disjoint matching. If input i is matched to output j in a given iteration, a packet (if any) is forwarded from i to j in the corresponding time step. Most of the iterative switching algorithms use a Request Grant Accept (RGA) arbitration type (e.g. iSLIP). Unfortunately, due to this particular type of arbitration, the matching computed in one iteration is not necessarily maximal (more input and output ports can still be matched). This is exactly why multiple iterations are needed. However, multiple iterations make the time step larger and reduce the speed of the switch. We present a new iterative switching algorithm (based on the RGA arbitration) called Ï\u20AC-RGA with the underlying assumption that the number of iterations is possibly limited to one, hence reducing the time step and allowing the switch to run at a higher speed. We prove that Ï\u20AC-RGA achieves throughput and delay guarantees with a speedup of 2 and one iteration under a constant burst traffic model, which makes Ï\u20AC-RGA as good as any maximal matching algorithm in the theoretical sense. We also show by simulation that Ï\u20AC-RGA achieves relatively high throughput in practice under uniform and non-uniform traffic patterns with one iteration and no speedup."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9713","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9713","fieldValue":"ACM"}
