A convergent sequence ${Y_m} of numerical solutions is said to be effectively convergent to the exact solution if there is an algorithm that computes an N âˆˆ &Nopf;, given an arbitrary n âˆˆ &Nopf; as input, such that the error between Ym$ and the exact solution is less than $2^-n$ for all m â\u2030¥ N. It is proved that there are convergent numerical solutions generated from Eulerâ\u20AC™s method which are not effectively convergent. It is also shown that a theoretically-proved-computable solution using Picardâ\u20AC™s iteration method might not be computable by classical numerical methods, which suggests that sometimes there is a gap between theoretical computability and practical numerical computations concerning solutions of ODEs. Moreover, it is noted that the main theorem (Theorem 4.1) provides an example of an IVP with a nonuniform Lipschitz function for which the numerical solutions generated by Eulerâ\u20AC™s method are still convergent."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12513","fieldValue":"ODonnell, Ryan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12513","fieldValue":" We study lower bounds for Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in the strongest setting: point sets in ${0,1}^d under the Hamming distance. Recall that H is said to be an (r, cr, p, q)-sensitive hash family if all pairs x, y âˆˆ {0,1}d with dist(x, y) â\u2030¤ r have probability at least p of collision under a randomly chosen h âˆˆ H, whereas all pairs x, y âˆˆ {0, 1}d with dist(x, y) â\u2030¥ cr have probability at most q of collision. Typically, one considers d â\u2020\u2019 âˆž, with c > 1 fixed and q bounded away from 0. For its applications to approximate nearest-neighbor search in high dimensions, the quality of an LSH family H is governed by how small its Ï? parameter Ï? = ln(1\/p)\/ln(1\/q) is as a function of the parameter c. The seminal paper of Indyk and Motwani [1998] showed that for each c â\u2030¥ 1, the extremely simple family H = {x â\u2020¦ $x_i : i âˆˆ [d]} achieves Ï? â\u2030¤ 1\/c. The only known lower bound, due to Motwani et al. [2007], is that Ï? must be at least ( e1\/c - 1)\/(e1\/c + 1) â\u2030¥ .46\/c (minus od(1)). The contribution of this article is twofold. (1) We show the â\u20ACœoptimalâ\u20AC? lower bound for Ï?: it must be at least 1\/c (minus od$(1)). Our proof is very simple, following almost immediately from the observation that the noise stability of a boolean function at time t is a log-convex function of t. (2) We raise and discuss the following issue: neither the application of LSH to nearest-neighbor search nor the known LSH lower bounds hold as stated if the q parameter is tiny. Here, â\u20ACœtinyâ\u20AC? means q = 2-Î˜(d)$, a parameter range we believe is natural."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12513","fieldValue":"LSH"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12514","fieldValue":" The field of kernelization studies polynomial-time preprocessing routines for hard problems in the framework of parameterized complexity.
