It is unique among all other schedulers of comparable complexity in that it provides a single packet delay bound that is independent of the number of flows. Importantly, it is also amenable to a simple hardware implementation, and thus fills a current gap between scheduling algorithms that have provably good performance and those that are feasible and practical to implement in high-speed routers. We present both analytical results and simulations to demonstrate its performance properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9550","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9551","fieldValue":" We consider a problem motivated by the desire to provide flexible, rate-based, quality of service guarantees for packets sent over input queued switches and switch networks. Our focus is solving a type of online traffic scheduling problem, whose input at each time step is a set of desired traffic rates through the switch network. These traffic rates in general cannot be exactly achieved since they assume arbitrarily small fractions of packets can be transmitted at each time step. The goal of the traffic scheduling problem is to closely approximate the given sequence of traffic rates by a sequence of transmissions in which only whole packets are sent. We prove worst-case bounds on the additional buffer use, which we call backlog, that results from using such an approximation.We first consider the N Ã\u2014 N, input queued, crossbar switch. Our main result is an online packet-scheduling algorithm using no speedup that guarantees backlog at most $(N+1)^2\/4 packets at each input port and each output port. Upper bounds on worst-case backlog have been proved for the case of constant fluid schedules, such as the N2$-2N+2 bound of Chang, Chen, and Huang (INFOCOM, 2000). Our main result for the crossbar switch is the first, to our knowledge, to bound backlog in terms of switch size N for arbitrary, time-varying fluid schedules, without using speedup.Our main result for Banyan networks is an exact characterization of the speedup required to maintain bounded backlog, in terms of polytopes derived from the network topology."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9551","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9551","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9551","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9552","fieldValue":" Shared path protection has been demonstrated to be a very efficient survivability scheme for optical networking. In this scheme, multiple backup paths can share a given optical channel if their corresponding primary routes are not expected to fail simultaneously. The focus in this area has been the optimization of the total channels (i.e., bandwidth) provisioned in the network through the intelligent routing of primary and backup routes. In this work, we extend the current path protection sharing scheme and introduce the Generalized Sharing Concept. In this concept, we allow for additional sharing of important node devices. These node devices (e.g., optical-electronic-optical regenerators (OEOs), pure all-optical converters, etc.) constitute the dominant cost factor in an optical backbone network and the reduction of their number is of paramount importance. For demonstration purposes, we extend the concept of 1:N shared path protection to allow for the sharing of electronic regenerators needed for coping with optical transmission impairments. Both design and control plane issues are discussed through numerical examples. Considerable cost reductions in electronic budget are demonstrated."}
