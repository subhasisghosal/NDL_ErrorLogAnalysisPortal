However, stylistic manga layouts are difficult for novices to produce as it requires hands-on experience and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically generate a stylistic manga layout from a set of input artworks with user-specified semantics, thus allowing less-experienced users to create high-quality manga layouts with minimal efforts. We first introduce three parametric style models that encode the unique stylistic aspects of manga layouts, including layout structure, panel importance, and panel shape. Next, we propose a two-stage approach to generate a manga layout: 1) an initial layout is created that best fits the input artworks and layout structure model, according to a generative probabilistic framework; 2) the layout and artwork geometries are jointly refined using an efficient optimization procedure, resulting in a professional-looking manga layout. Through a user study, we demonstrate that our approach enables novice users to easily and quickly produce higher-quality layouts that exhibit realistic manga styles, when compared to a commercially-available manual layout tool."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16730","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16730","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16731","fieldValue":"Au, Oscar Kin-Chung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16731","fieldValue":"Tai, Chiew-Lan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16731","fieldValue":" This paper presents Lazy Selection, a scribble-based tool for quick selection of one or more desired shape elements by roughly stroking through the elements. Our algorithm automatically refines the selection and reveals the user's intention. To give the user maximum flexibility but least ambiguity, our technique first extracts selection candidates from the scribble-covered elements by examining the underlying patterns and then ranks them based on their location and shape with respect to the user-sketched scribble. Such a design makes our tool tolerant to imprecise input systems and applicable to touch systems without suffering from the fat finger problem. A preliminary evaluation shows that compared to the standard click and lasso selection tools, which are the most commonly used, our technique provides significant improvements in efficiency and flexibility for many selection scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16731","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16731","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16732","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}
