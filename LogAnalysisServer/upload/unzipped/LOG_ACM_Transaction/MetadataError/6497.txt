Modeling an individual's activities is itself a challenge, due to the variety of activity, constraint, and preference types involved. Activities might be simple or interruptible; they might have fixed or variable durations, constraints over their temporal domains, and binary constraints between them. Activities might require the individual being at specific locations in order, whereas traveling time should be taken into account. Some activities might require exclusivity, whereas others can be overlapped with compatible concurrent activities. Finally, while scheduled activities generate utility for the individual, extra utility might result from the way activities are scheduled in time, individually and in conjunction. This article presents a rigorous, expressive model to represent an individual's activities, that is, activities whose scheduling is not contingent on any other person. Joint activities such as meetings are outside our remit; it is expected that these are arranged manually or through negotiation mechanisms and they are considered as fixed busy times in the individual's calendar. The model, formulated as a constraint optimization problem, is general enough to accommodate a variety of situations. We present a scheduler that operates on this rich model, based on the general squeaky wheel optimization framework and enhanced with domain-dependent heuristics and forward checking. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates both the efficiency and the effectiveness of the selected approach. Part of the work described has been implemented in the SelfPlanner system, a Web-based intelligent calendar application that utilizes Google Calendar."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7321","fieldValue":" Forces involved in modern conflicts may be exposed to a variety of threats, including coordinated raids of advanced ballistic and cruise missiles. To respond to these, a defending force will rely on a set of combat resources. Determining an efficient allocation and coordinated use of these resources, particularly in the case of multiple simultaneous attacks, is a very complex decision-making process in which a huge amount of data must be dealt with under uncertainty and time pressure. This article presents CORALS (COmbat Resource ALlocation Support), a real-time planner developed to support the command team of a naval force defending against multiple simultaneous threats. In response to such multiple threats, CORALS uses a local planner to generate a set of local plans, one for each threat considered apart, and then combines and coordinates them into a single optimized, conflict-free global plan. The coordination is performed through an iterative process of plan merging and conflict detection and resolution, which acts as a plan repair mechanism. Such an incremental plan repair approach also allows adapting previously generated plans to account for dynamic changes in the tactical situation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7322","fieldValue":" As the number of applications for human-robot teaming continue to rise, there is an increasing need for planning technologies that can guide robots in such teaming scenarios. In this article, we focus on adapting planning technology to Urban Search And Rescue (USAR) with a human-robot team. We start by showing that several aspects of state-of-the-art planning technology, including temporal planning, partial satisfaction planning, and replanning, can be gainfully adapted to this scenario. We then note that human-robot teaming also throws up an additional critical challenge, namely, enabling existing planners, which work under closed-world assumptions, to cope with the open worlds that are characteristic of teaming problems such as USAR. In response, we discuss the notion of conditional goals, and describe how we represent and handle a specific class of them called open world quantified goals. Finally, we describe how the planner, and its open world extensions, are integrated into a robot control architecture, and provide an empirical evaluation over USAR experimental runs to establish the effectiveness of the planning components."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7322","fieldValue":"ACM"}
