We begin with an explanation of why this poset structure is common. We show any family of sets F that can be defined by a \u20AClabelling algorithm\u20AC? (e.g., the Ford-Fulkerson labelling algorithm for maximum network flow) has an algorithm that constructs the minset poset for F. We implement this algorithm to efficiently find the nodes of the poset when F is the family of minimum edge cuts of an unweighted graph; we also give related algorithms to construct the entire poset for weighted graphs. The rest of the article discusses applications to edge- and vertex connectivity, both combinatorial and algorithmic, that we now describe. For digraphs, a natural interpretation of the minset poset represents all minimum edge cuts. In the special case of undirected graphs, the minset poset is proved to be a variant of the well-known cactus representation of all mincuts. We use the poset algorithms to construct the cactus representation for unweighted graphs in time $O(m+位^2 n log (n\/位)) (位 is the edge connectivity) improving the previous bound O(位 n2) for all but the densest graphs. We also construct the cactus representation for weighted graphs in time O(nm log(n2$\/m)), the same bound as a previously known algorithm but in linear space O(m). The latter bound also holds for constructing the minset poset for any weighted digraph; the former bound also holds for constructing the nodes of that poset for any unweighted digraph. The poset is used in algorithms to increase the edge connectivity of a graph by adding the fewest edges possible. For directed and undirected graphs, weighted and unweighted, we achieve the time of the preceding two bounds, i.e., essentially the best-known bounds to compute the edge connectivity itself. Some constructions of minset posets for graph rigidity are also sketched. For vertex connectivity, the minset poset is proved to be a slight variant of the dominator tree. This leads to an algorithm to construct the dominator tree in time O(m) on a RAM. (The algorithm is included in the appendix, since other linear-time algorithms of similar simplicity have recently been presented.)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2698","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2698","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18119","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18119","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18120","fieldValue":"Algorithm 519: Three Algorithms for Computing Kolmogorov-Smirnov Probabilities with Arbitrary Boundaries and a Certification of Algorithm 487 [S14]"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18120","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18120","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18121","fieldValue":"ACM"}
