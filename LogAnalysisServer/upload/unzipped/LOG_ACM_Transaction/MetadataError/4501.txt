Initial iterative exploration showed that gaining performance advantage with auditory feedback was possible using absolute cues and state feedback after the gesture was produced and recognized. However, gaining learning or performance advantage from auditory feedback tightly coupled with the pen-gesture articulation and recognition process was more difficult. To establish a systematic baseline, Experiment 1 formally evaluated gesture production accuracy as a function of auditory and visual feedback. Size of gestures and the aperture of the closed gestures were influenced by the visual or auditory feedback, while other measures such as shape distance and directional difference were not, supporting the theory that feedback is too slow to strongly influence the production of pen stroke gestures. Experiment 2 focused on the subjective aspects of auditory feedback in pen-gesture interfaces. Participants' rating on the dimensions of being wonderful and stimulating was significantly higher with musical auditory feedback. Several lessons regarding pen gestures and auditory feedback are drawn from our exploration: a few simple functions such as indicating the pen-gesture recognition results can be achieved, gaining performance and learning advantage through tightly coupled process-based auditory feedback is difficult, pen-gesture sets and their recognizers can be designed to minimize visual dependence, and people's subjective experience of gesture interaction can be influenced using musical auditory feedback. These lessons may serve as references and stepping stones toward future research and development in pen-gesture interfaces with auditory feedback."}
