It is often claimed in the literature that finite element analysis is less accurate than equilibrium analysis when it comes to masonry analysis; we examine and qualify this claimed inaccuracy, provide a systematic explanation for the discrepancy observed between their results, and present a unified formulation of the two approaches to stability analysis. We prove that both approaches can be viewed as equivalent, dual methods for getting the same answer to the same problem. We validate our observations with simulations and physical tilt experiments of structures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17510","fieldValue":" Manifold is an important technique to model geometric objects with arbitrary topology. In this article, we propose a novel approach for constructing manifolds from discrete meshes based on sparse optimization. The local geometry for each chart is sparsely represented by a set of redundant atom functions, which have the flexibility to represent various geometries with varying smoothness. A global optimization is then proposed to guarantee compatible sparse representations in the overlapping regions of different charts. Our method can construct manifolds of varying smoothness including sharp features (creases, darts, or cusps). As an application, we can easily construct a skinning manifold surface from a given curve network. Examples show that our approach has much flexibility to generate manifold surfaces with good quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17511","fieldValue":" We explore the question of whether phase-based time-of-flight (TOF) range cameras can be used for looking around corners and through scattering diffusers. By connecting TOF measurements with theory from array signal processing, we conclude that performance depends on two primary factors: camera modulation frequency and the width of the specular lobe (â\u20ACœshininessâ\u20AC?) of the wall. For purely Lambertian walls, commodity TOF sensors achieve resolution on the order of meters between targets. For seemingly diffuse walls, such as posterboard, the resolution is drastically reduced, to the order of 10cm. In particular, we find that the relationship between reflectance and resolution is nonlinearâ\u20AC\u201Da slight amount of shininess can lead to a dramatic improvement in resolution. Since many realistic scenes exhibit a slight amount of shininess, we believe that off-the-shelf TOF cameras can look around corners."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17512","fieldValue":" For the purposes of computer graphics, we have developed a simulation tool to model fluid flow on the surface of a sphere with the inclusion of control parameters for the benefit of art directability. Difficulties associated with the use of spherical coordinates were surmounted by the use of locally modified consistent equations that result from an analysis of the singular equations in the neighborhood of the poles. The resulting system was solved efficiently for only a small additional cost when compared to a two-dimensional planar simulation."}
