{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21249","fieldValue":" Mobile sinks are needed in many sensor network applications for efficient data collection, data querying, localized sensor reprogramming, identifying, and revoking compromised sensors, and other network maintenance. Employing mobile sinks however raises a new security challenge: if a mobile sink is given too many privileges, it will become very attractive for attack and compromise. Using a compromised mobile sink, an adversary may easily bring down or even take over the sensor network. Thus, security mechanisms that can tolerate mobile sink compromises are essential. In this article, based on the principle of least privilege, we first propose an efficient scheme to restrict the privilege of a mobile sink without impeding its ability to carry out any authorized operations for an assigned task. In addition, we present an extension to allow conditional trajectory change due to unexpected events. To further reduce the possible damage caused by a compromised mobile sink, we propose efficient message forwarding schemes for deleting the privilege assigned to a compromised mobile sink immediately after its compromise has been detected. Through detailed analysis, simulation, and real implementation, we show that our schemes are secure and efficient, and are highly practical for sensor networks consisting of the current generation of sensors."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21249","fieldValue":"Least privilege and privilege deprivation: Toward tolerating mobile sink compromises in wireless sensor networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21250","fieldValue":" The efficacy of data aggregation in sensor networks is a function of the degree of spatial correlation in the sensed phenomenon. The recent literature has examined a variety of schemes that achieve greater data aggregation by routing data with regard to the underlying spatial correlation. A well known conclusion from these papers is that the nature of optimal routing with compression depends on the correlation level. In this article we show the existence of a simple, practical, and static correlation-unaware clustering scheme that satisfies a min-max near-optimality condition. The implication for system design is that a static correlation-unaware scheme can perform as well as sophisticated adaptive schemes for joint routing and compression."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21250","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21250","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21251","fieldValue":" Given a sensor network and aggregate queries over the values sensed by subsets of nodes in the network, how do we ensure that high quality results are served for the maximum possible time&quest; The issues underlying this question relate to the fidelity of query results and lifetime of the network. To maximize both, we propose a novel technique called asynchronous in-network prediction incorporating two computationally efficient methods for in-network prediction of partial aggregate values. These values are propagated via a tree whose construction is cognizant of (a) the coherency requirements associated with the queries, (b) the remaining energy at the sensors, and (c) the communication and message processing delays. Finally, we exploit in-network filtering and in-network aggregation to reduce the energy consumption of the nodes in the network. Experimental results over real world data support our claim that, for aggregate queries with associated coherency requirements, a prediction-based, asynchronous scheme provides higher quality results for a longer amount of time than a synchronous scheme. Also, whereas aggregate dissemination techniques proposed so far for sensor networks appear to have to trade-off quality of data for energy efficiency, we demonstrate that this is not always necessary."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21251","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21251","fieldValue":"ACM"}
