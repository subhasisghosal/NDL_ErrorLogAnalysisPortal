Such messaging offers benefits of efficiency, exclusiveness, and intensionality, but faces challenges in access control and confidentiality. In this article we explore an approach to intraenterprise ABM based on providing access control and confidentiality using information from the same attribute database exploited by the addressing scheme. We show how to address three key challenges. First, we demonstrate a manageable access control system based on attributes. Second, we demonstrate use of attribute-based encryption to provide end-to-end confidentiality. Third, we show that such a system can be efficient enough to support ABM for mid-size enterprises. Our implementation can dispatch confidential ABM messages approved by XACML policy review for an enterprise of at least 60,000 users with only seconds of latency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22307","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22308","fieldValue":" Query authentication is an essential component in Outsourced DataBase (ODB) systems. This article introduces efficient index structures for authenticating aggregation queries over large datasets. First, we design an index that features good performance characteristics for static environments. Then, we propose more involved structures for the dynamic case. Our structures feature excellent performance for authenticating queries with multiple aggregate attributes and multiple selection predicates. Furthermore, our techniques cover a large number of aggregate types, including distributive aggregates (such as SUM, COUNT, MIN, and MAX), algebraic aggregates (such as the AVG), and holistic aggregates (such as MEDIAN and QUANTILE). We have also addressed the issue of authenticating aggregation queries efficiently when the database is encrypted to protect data confidentiality. Finally, we implemented a working prototype of the proposed techniques and experimentally validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22308","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22308","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3129","fieldValue":" Semantic parsing maps a sentence in natural language into a structured meaning representation. Previous studies show that semantic parsing with synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) achieves favorable performance over most other alternatives. Motivated by the observation that the performance of semantic parsing with SCFGs is closely tied to the translation rules, this article explores to extend translation rules with high quality and increased coverage in three ways. First, we examine the difference between word alignments for semantic parsing and statistical machine translation (SMT) to better adapt word alignment in SMT to semantic parsing. Second, we introduce both structure and syntax informed nonterminals, better guiding the parsing in favor of well-formed structure, instead of using a uninformed nonterminal in SCFGs. Third, we address the unknown word translation issue via synthetic translation rules. Last but not least, we use a filtering approach to improve performance via predicting answer type. Evaluation on the standard GeoQuery benchmark dataset shows that our approach greatly outperforms the state of the art across various languages, including English, Chinese, Thai, German, and Greek."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3129","fieldValue":"Improving Semantic Parsing with Enriched Synchronous Context-Free Grammars in Statistical Machine Translation"}
