We show that these problems can be computed by polynomial size nondeterministic circuits of unbounded fan-in with O(log log n) depth and $O(log^2 n) nondeterministic bits, where n is the number of group elements. This improves the existing upper bound for the problems. In the previous bound the circuits have bounded fan-in but depth O(log2 n) and also O(log2 n) nondeterministic bits. We then prove that the kind of circuits from our upper bound cannot compute the Parity function. Since Parity is AC0-reducible to Graph Isomorphism, this implies that Graph Isomorphism is strictly harder than Group or Quasigroup Isomorphism under the ordering defined by AC0 reductions. We extend this result to the stronger ACC0$[p] reduction and its randomized version."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12504","fieldValue":" The results of Raghavendra [2008] show that assuming Khotâ\u20AC™s Unique Games Conjecture [2002], for every constraint satisfaction problem there exists a generic semidefinite program that achieves the optimal approximation factor. This result is existential as it does not provide an explicit optimal rounding procedure nor does it allow to calculate exactly the Unique Games hardness of the problem. Obtaining an explicit optimal approximation scheme and the corresponding approximation factor is a difficult challenge for each specific approximation problem. Khot et al. [2004] established a general approach for determining the exact approximation factor and the corresponding optimal rounding algorithm for any given constraint satisfaction problem. However, this approach crucially relies on results explicitly proving optimal partitions in the Gaussian space. Until recently, Borellâ\u20AC™s result [1985] was the only nontrivial Gaussian partition result known. In this article we derive the first explicit optimal approximation algorithm and the corresponding approximation factor using a new result on Gaussian partitions due to Isaksson and Mossel [2012]. This Gaussian result allows us to determine the exact Unique Games Hardness of MAX-3-EQUAL. In particular, our results show that Zwickâ\u20AC™s algorithm for this problem achieves the optimal approximation factor and prove that the approximation achieved by the algorithm is &ap; 0.796 as conjectured by Zwick [1998]. We further use the previously known optimal Gaussian partitions results to obtain a new Unique Games Hardness factor for MAX-k-CSP: Using the well-known fact that jointly normal pairwise independent random variables are fully independent, we show that the UGC hardness of Max-k-CSP is âŒˆ(k+1)\/2âŒ\u2030 $2^kâˆ\u20191$, improving on results of Austrin and Mossel [2009]."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12504","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12504","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12505","fieldValue":" An algorithm for a constraint satisfaction problem is called robust if it outputs an assignment satisfying at least a (1 âˆ\u2019 f(Îµ))-fraction of constraints for each (1 âˆ\u2019 Îµ)-satisfiable instance (i.e., such that at most a Îµ-fraction of constraints needs to be removed to make the instance satisfiable), where f(Îµ) â\u2020\u2019 0 as Îµ â\u2020\u2019 0. We establish an algebraic framework for analyzing constraint satisfaction problems admitting an efficient robust algorithm with functions f of a given growth rate. We use this framework to derive hardness results. We also describe three classes of problems admitting an efficient robust algorithm such that f is O(1\/log (1\/Îµ)), $O(Îµ^1\/k$) for some k > 1, and O(Îµ), respectively. Finally, we give a complete classification of robust satisfiability with a given f for the Boolean case."}
