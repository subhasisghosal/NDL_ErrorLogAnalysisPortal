Specifically, we consider a primary license holder that aims to lease its spectrum within a certain geographic subregion of its network. Such a transaction has two contrasting economic implications: On the one hand the lessor obtains a revenue due to the exercised price of the region. On the other hand, it incurs a cost due to: 1) reduced spatial coverage of its network; and 2) possible interference from the leased region into the retained portion of its network, leading to increased call blocking. We formulate this tradeoff as an optimization problem, with the objective of profit maximization. We consider a range of pricing philosophies and derive near-optimal solutions that are based on a reduced load approximation (RLA) for estimating blocking probabilities. The form of these prices suggests charging the lessee in proportion to the fraction of admitted calls.We also exploit the special structure of the solutions to devise an efficient iterative procedure for computing prices. We present numerical results that demonstrate superiority of the proposed strategy over several alternative strategies. The results emphasize importance of effective pricing strategies in bringing secondary markets to full realization."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9971","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9971","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9971","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9972","fieldValue":" The rapid growth of media content distribution on the Internet in the past few years has brought with it commensurate increases in the costs of distributing that content. Can the content distributor defray these costs through a more innovative approach to distribution? In this paper, we evaluate the benefits of a hybrid system that combines peer-to-peer and a centralized client-server approach against each method acting alone. A key element of our approach is to explicitly model the temporal evolution of demand. In particular, we employ a word-of-mouth demand evolution model due to Bass [2] to represent the evolution of interest in a piece of content. Our analysis is carried out in an order scaling depending on the total potential mass of customers in the market. Using this approach, we study the relative performance of peer-to-peer and centralized client-server schemes, as well as a hybrid of the two--both from the point of view of consumers as well as the content distributor.We show how awareness of demand can be used to attain a given average delay target with lowest possible utilization of the central server by using the hybrid scheme.We also show how such awareness can be used to take provisioning decisions. Our insights are obtained in a fluid model and supported by stochastic simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9972","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
