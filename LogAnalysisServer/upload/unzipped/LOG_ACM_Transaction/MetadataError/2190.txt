Previous applications of nonlinear solid elasticity employed materials from a few standard families such as linear corotational, nonlinear St.Venant-Kirchhoff, Neo-Hookean, Ogden or Mooney-Rivlin materials. However, the spaces of all nonlinear isotropic and anisotropic materials are infinite-dimensional and much broader than these standard materials. In this paper, we demonstrate how to intuitively explore the space of isotropic and anisotropic nonlinear materials, for design of animations in computer graphics and related fields. In order to do so, we first formulate the internal elastic forces and tangent stiffness matrices in the space of the principal stretches of the material. We then demonstrate how to design new isotropic materials by editing a single stress-strain curve, using a spline interface. Similarly, anisotropic (orthotropic) materials can be designed by editing three curves, one for each material direction. We demonstrate that modifying these curves using our proposed interface has an intuitive, visual, effect on the simulation. Our materials accelerate simulation design and enable visual effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve with standard nonlinear materials."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17323","fieldValue":"FEM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17323","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17324","fieldValue":"DeRose, Tony"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17324","fieldValue":" Subspace deformable body simulations can be very fast, but can behave unrealistically when behaviors outside the prescribed subspace such as novel external collisions, are encountered. We address this limitation by presenting a fast, flexible new method that allows full space computation to be activated in the neighborhood of novel events while the rest of the body still computes in a subspace. We achieve this using a method we call subspace condensation, a variant on the classic static condensation precomputation. However, instead of a precomputation, we use the speed of subspace methods to perform the condensation at every frame. This approach allows the full space regions to be specified arbitrarily at runtime, and forms a natural two-way coupling with the subspace regions. While condensation is usually only applicable to linear materials, the speed of our technique enables its application to non-linear materials as well. We show the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to a variety of articulated character scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17324","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17325","fieldValue":"ztireli, A.
