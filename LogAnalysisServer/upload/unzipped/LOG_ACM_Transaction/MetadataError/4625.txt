Any protocols developed for screening and surveillance and any policy decisions regarding the availability of CRC resources should consider the nature of the disease and its impact over time on costs and quality-adjusted life years in a population. Simulation models can provide a flexible representation needed for such analysis; however, the development of a credible simulation model of the natural history of CRC is hindered by limited data and incomplete knowledge. To accommodate the extensive modeling and remodeling required to produce a credible model, we created an object-oriented simulation platform driven by a model-independent database within the .NET environment. The object-oriented structure not only encapsulated the needs of a simulation replication but created an extensible framework for specialization of the CRC components. This robust framework allowed development to focus modeling on the CRC events and their event relationships, conveniently facilitating extensive revision during model construction. As a second-generation CRC modeling activity, this model development benefited from prior experience with data sources and modeling difficulties. A graphical user interface makes the model accessible by displaying existing scenarios, showing input variables and their values, and permitting the creation of new scenarios and changes to its input. Output from the simulation is captured in familiar tabbed worksheets and stored in the database. The eventual CRC model was conceptualized through a series of assumptions that conformed to beliefs and data regarding the natural history of CRC. Throughout the development cycle, extensive verification and validation calibrated the model. The result is a simulation model that characterizes the natural history of CRC with sufficient accuracy to provide an effective means of evaluating numerous issues regarding the burden of this disease on individuals and society. Generalizations from this study are offered regarding the use of discrete-event simulation in disease modeling and medical decision making."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24955","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24955","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3414","fieldValue":" We conducted a series of experiments to investigate effects of scale changes on distance perception in virtual environments. All experiments were carried out in an HMD. Participants first made distance estimates with feedback in a virtual tunnel (adaptation) and then made distance estimates without feedback in a differently-scaled virtual environment (test). We examined several types of scale changes, including changing the size of (1) the tunnel, (2) the targets, and (3) the separation of the two targets. Changes in target size always affected distance estimates at test. When the targets became smaller, participants overshot distance and when the targets became larger, participants undershot distance. Changes in the size of the tunnel or the separation between the targets (without a change in the size of the targets) had a minimal effect on distance estimates. These results indicate that distance estimates at test were strongly influenced by familiar size cues for distance. The discussion focuses on the stability of calibration processes and mechanisms for cue integration for perceiving distance in virtual environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3414","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3414","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24956","fieldValue":" Simulation of Internet worms (and other malware) requires tremendous computing resources when every packet generated by the phenomena is modeled individually; on the other hand, models of worm growth based on differential equations lack the significant variability inherent in worms that sample targets randomly. This article addresses the problem with a model that focuses on times of infection. We propose a hybrid discrete-continuous model that minimizes execution time subject to an accuracy constraint on variance. We also develop an efficiently executed model of preferential random scanning and use it to investigate the sensitivity of worm propagation speed to the distribution of susceptible hosts through the network, and to the local preference probability. Finally, we propose and study two optimizations to a fluid-based simulation of scan traffic through a backbone network, observing an order-of-magnitude improvement in execution speed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24956","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24956","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24957","fieldValue":" We present a simple, deterministic mathematical model for the spread of randomly scanning and bandwidth-saturating Internet worms. Such worms include Slammer and Witty, both of which spread extremely rapidly. Our model, consisting of coupled Kermack-McKendrick (a.k.a. stratified susceptibles-infectives (SI)) equations, captures both the measured scanning activity of the worm and the network limitation of its spread, that is, the effective scan-rate per worm\/infective. The Internet is modeled as an ideal core network to which each peripheral (e.g., enterprise) network is connected via a single access link. It is further assumed in this note that as soon as a single end-system in the peripheral network is infected by the worm, the subsequent scanning of the rest of the Internet saturates the access link, that is, there is â\u20ACœinstantâ\u20AC? saturation. We fit our model to available data for the Slammer worm and demonstrate the model's ability to accurately represent Slammer's total scan-rate to the core."}
