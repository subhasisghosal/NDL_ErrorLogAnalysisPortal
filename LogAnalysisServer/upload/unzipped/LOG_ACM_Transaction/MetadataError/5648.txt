A coupling graph is a two-layer graph complex, in which each node from one layer of the graph complex has at least one connection with the nodes in the other layer, and vice versa. The coupling graph model is sufficiently powerful to capture strong and inherent associations between subgraph pairs in complicated applications. The focus of this paper is on mining algorithms of frequent coupling subgraphs and bioinformatics application. Although existing frequent subgraph mining algorithms are competent to identify frequent subgraphs from a graph database, they perform poorly on frequent coupling subgraph mining because they generate many irrelevant subgraphs. We propose a novel graph transformation technique to transform a coupling graph into a generic graph. Based on the transformed coupling graphs, existing graph mining methods are then utilized to discover frequent coupling subgraphs. We prove that the transformation is precise and complete and that the restoration is reversible. Experiments carried out on a database containing 10,511 coupling graphs show that our proposed algorithm reduces the mining time very much in comparison with the existing subgraph mining algorithms. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of frequent coupling subgraphs by applying our algorithm to make accurate predictions of epitopes in antibody-antigen binding."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5016","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5016","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5016","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5017","fieldValue":" The major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a cell-surface protein mediating immune recognition, plays important roles in the immune response system of all higher vertebrates. MHC molecules are highly polymorphic and they are grouped into serotypes according to the specificity of the response. It is a common belief that a protein sequence determines its three dimensional structure and function. Hence, the protein sequence determines the serotype. Residues play different levels of importance. In this paper, we quantify the residue significance with the available serotype information. Knowing the significance of the residues will deepen our understanding of the MHC molecules and yield us a concise representation of the molecules. In this paper we propose a linear programming-based approach to find significant residue positions as well as quantifying their significance in MHC II DR molecules. A mong all the residues in MHC II DR molecules, 18 positions are of particular significance, which is consistent with the literature on MHC binding sites, and succinct pseudo-sequences appear to be adequate to capture the whole sequence features. When the result is used for classification of MHC molecules with serotype assigned by WHO, a 98.4 percent prediction performance is achieved. The methods have been implemented in java (http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/quassi\/)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5017","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5017","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5017","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5018","fieldValue":" Proline cis-trans isomerization (CTI) plays a key role in the rate-determining steps of protein folding. Accurate prediction of proline CTI is of great importance for the understanding of protein folding, splicing, cell signaling, and transmembrane active transport in both the human body and animals. Our goal is to develop a state-of-the-art proline CTI predictor based on a biophysically motivated intelligent consensus modeling through the use of sequence information only (i.e., position specific scores generated by PSI-BLAST). The current computational proline CTI predictors reach about 70-73 percent Q2 accuracies and about 0.40 Matthew correlation coefficient (Mcc) through the use of sequence-based evolutionary information as well as predicted protein secondary structure information. However, our approach that utilizes a novel decision tree-based consensus model with a powerful randomized-metalearning technique has achieved 86.58 percent Q2 accuracy and 0.74 Mcc, on the same proline CTI data set, which is a better result than those of any existing computational proline CTI predictors reported in the literature."}
