We show that the only such change of measure that may possibly result in asymptotically efficient simulation for large overflow levels is exchanging the arrival rate with the smallest service rate. For this change of measure, we classify the model's parameter space into regions of asymptotic efficiency, exponential growth of the relative error, and infinite variance, using both analytical and numerical techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24927","fieldValue":"Villn-Altamirano, Manuel"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24927","fieldValue":"Villn-Altamirano, Jos"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24927","fieldValue":" RESTART (Repetitive Simulation Trials After Reaching Thresholds) is a widely applicable accelerated simulation technique that allows the evaluation of extremely low probabilities. The focus of this article is on providing guidelines for achieving a high efficiency in a simulation with RESTART. Emphasis is placed on the choice of the importance function, that is, the function of the system state for determining when retrials are made. A heuristic approach which is shown to be effective for some systems is proposed for this choice. A two-queue tandem network is used to illustrate the efficiency achieved following these guidelines. The importance function chosen in this example shows that an appropriate choice of the importance function leads to an efficient simulation of a system with multidimensional state space. Also presented are sufficient conditions for achieving asymptotic efficiency, and it is shown that they are not very restrictive in RESTART simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24927","fieldValue":"RESTART"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24928","fieldValue":" We develop a class of techniques for analyzing the output of simulations of a semi-regenerative process. Called the semi-regenerative method, the approach is a generalization of the regenerative method, and it can increase efficiency. We consider the estimation of various performance measures, including steady-state means, expected cumulative reward until hitting a set of states, derivatives of steady-state means, and time-average variance constants. We also discuss importance sampling and a bias-reduction technique. In each case, we develop two estimators: one based on a simulation of a single sample path, and the other a type of stratified estimator in which trajectories are generated in an independent and identically distributed manner. We establish a central limit theorem for each estimator so confidence intervals can be constructed."}
