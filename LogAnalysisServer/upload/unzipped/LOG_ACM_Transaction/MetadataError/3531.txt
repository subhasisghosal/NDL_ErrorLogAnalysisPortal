{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21497","fieldValue":" A problem is introduced in which a moving body (robot, human, animal, vehicle, and so on) travels among obstacles and binary detection beams that connect between obstacles or barriers. Each beam can be viewed as a virtual sensor that may have many possible alternative implementations. The task is to determine the possible body paths based only on sensor observations that each simply report that a beam crossing occurred. This is a basic filtering problem encountered in many settings, under a variety of sensing modalities. Filtering methods are presented that reconstruct the set of possible paths at three levels of resolution: (1) the possible sequences of regions (bounded by beams and obstacles) visited, (2) equivalence classes of homo-topic paths, and (3) the possible numbers of times the path winds around obstacles. In the simplest case, all beams are disjoint, distinguishable, and directed. More complex cases are then considered, allowing for any amount of beams overlapping, indistinguishability, and lack of directional information. The method was implemented in simulation. An inexpensive, low-energy, easily deployable architecture was also created which implements the beam model and validates the methods of the article with experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21497","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21498","fieldValue":"Kaplan, Lance M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21498","fieldValue":" Motivated by the need to judiciously allocate scarce sensing resources to attain the highest benefit for the applications that sensor networks serve, in this article we develop a flexible solutions methodology for maximizing the overall reward attained, subject to constraints on the resource demands under fairly general reward or demand functions. We map a broad class of related problems for data fusion in wireless sensor networks into an integer programming problem and provide an iterative Lagrangian relaxation technique to solve it. Each iteration step involves solving for a maximum-weight independent set of an appropriately constructed graph, which, in many cases, can be obtained in polynomial time. We apply our methodology to the problem of tracking targets moving over a period of time through a nonhomogeneous, energy-constrained sensor field. With rewards represented by the quality of information attained in tracking, we study its trade-offs and relationship with energy consumption and periodic measurement taking. We finally illustrate other applications of our framework in sensor networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21498","fieldValue":"Efficient Solutions Framework for Optimal Multitask Resource Assignments for Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21498","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21499","fieldValue":" As wireless networks become more pervasive, the amount of the wireless data is rapidly increasing. One of the biggest challenges of wide adoption of distributed data storage is how to store these data securely. In this work, we study the frequency-based attack, a type of attack that is different from previously well-studied ones, that exploits additional adversary knowledge of domain values and\/or their exact\/approximate frequencies to crack the encrypted data. To cope with frequency-based attacks, the straightforward 1-to-1 substitution encryption functions are not sufficient. We propose a data encryption strategy based on 1-to-n substitution via dividing and emulating techniques to defend against the frequency-based attack, while enabling efficient query evaluation over encrypted data. We further develop two frameworks, incremental collection and clustered collection, which are used to defend against the global frequency-based attack when the knowledge of the global frequency in the network is not available. Built upon our basic encryption schemes, we derive two mechanisms, direct emulating and dual encryption, to handle updates on the data storage for energy-constrained sensor nodes and wireless devices. Our preliminary experiments with sensor nodes and extensive simulation results show that our data encryption strategy can achieve high security guarantee with low overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21499","fieldValue":"ACM"}
