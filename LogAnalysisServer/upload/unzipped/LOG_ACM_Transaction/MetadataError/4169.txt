In particular, we seek to develop system tools and linguistic processing techniques that are themselves language-independent to the maximum extent practical. In this paper we discuss our project goals and outline our intended approach, address some cross-linguistic requirements, and then present some new linguistic data that we feel support our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23574","fieldValue":"Transportability to other languages: the natural language processing project in the AI program at MCC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23574","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23574","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23575","fieldValue":" A network of personal computers may contain a large amount of distributed computing resources. For a number of reasons it is desirable to share these resources, but sharing is complicated by issues of security and autonomy. A process known as the Butler addresses these problems and provides support for resource sharing. The Butler relies upon a capability-based accounting system called the Banker to monitor the use of local resources."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23575","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23575","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23576","fieldValue":"McLeod, Dennis"}
