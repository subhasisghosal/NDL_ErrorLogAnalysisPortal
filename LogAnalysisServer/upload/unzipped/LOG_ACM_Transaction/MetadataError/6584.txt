{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7541","fieldValue":" Given a social graph, the problem of influence maximization is to determine a set of nodes that maximizes the spread of influences. While some recent research has studied the problem of influence maximization, these works are generally too time consuming for practical use in a large-scale social network. In this article, we develop a new framework, community-based influence maximization (CIM), to tackle the influence maximization problem with an emphasis on the time efficiency issue. Our proposed framework, CIM, comprises three phases: (i) community detection, (ii) candidate generation, and (iii) seed selection. Specifically, phase (i) discovers the community structure of the network; phase (ii) uses the information of communities to narrow down the possible seed candidates; and phase (iii) finalizes the seed nodes from the candidate set. By exploiting the properties of the community structures, we are able to avoid overlapped information and thus efficiently select the number of seeds to maximize information spreads. The experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed CIM algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of efficiency and scalability, with almost no compromise of effectiveness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7541","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7541","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7542","fieldValue":" One of the main organizing principles in real-world networks is that of network communities, where sets of nodes organize into densely linked clusters. Even though detection of such communities is of great interest, understanding the structure communities in large networks remains relatively limited. In particular, due to the unavailability of labeled ground-truth data, it was traditionally very hard to develop accurate models of network community structure. Here we use six large social, collaboration, and information networks where nodes explicitly state their ground-truth community memberships. For example, nodes in social networks join into explicitly defined interest based groups, and we use such groups as explicitly labeled ground-truth communities. We use such ground-truth communities to study their structural signatures by analyzing how ground-truth communities emerge in networks and how they overlap. We observe some surprising phenomena. First, ground-truth communities contain high-degree hub nodes that reside in community overlaps and link to most of the members of the community. Second, the overlaps of communities are more densely connected than the non-overlapping parts of communities. We show that this in contrast to the conventional wisdom that community overlaps are more sparsely connected than the non-overlapping parts themselves. We then show that many existing models of network communities do not capture dense community overlaps. This in turn means that most present models and community detection methods confuse overlaps as separate communities. In contrast, we present the community-affiliation graph model (AGM), a conceptual model of network community structure. We demonstrate that AGM reliably captures the overall structure of networks as well as the overlapping and hierarchical nature of network communities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7542","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7542","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1685","fieldValue":" In today's digital world, computer security issues have become increasingly important. In particular, researchers have proposed designs for secure processors that utilize hardware-based memory encryption and integrity verification to protect the privacy and integrity of computation even from sophisticated physical attacks. However, currently proposed schemes remain hampered by problems that make them impractical for use in today's computer systems: lack of virtual memory and Inter-Process Communication support as well as excessive storage and performance overheads. In this article, we propose (1) address independent seed encryption (AISE), a counter-mode-based memory encryption scheme using a novel seed composition, and (2) bonsai Merkle trees (BMT), a novel Merkle tree-based memory integrity verification technique, to eliminate these system and performance issues associated with prior counter-mode memory encryption and Merkle tree integrity verification schemes. We present both a qualitative discussion and a quantitative analysis to illustrate the advantages of our techniques over previously proposed approaches in terms of complexity, feasibility, performance, and storage. Our results show that AISE+BMT reduces the overhead of prior memory encryption and integrity verification schemes from 12&percnt; to 2&percnt; on average for single-threaded benchmarks on uniprocessor systems, and from 15&percnt; to 4&percnt; for coscheduled benchmarks on multicore systems while eliminating critical system-level problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1685","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1685","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7543","fieldValue":" The effects of social influence and homophily suggest that both network structure and node-attribute information should inform the tasks of link prediction and node-attribute inference. Recently, Yin et al. [2010a, 2010b] proposed an attribute-augmented social network model, which we call Social-Attribute Network (SAN), to integrate network structure and node attributes to perform both link prediction and attribute inference. They focused on generalizing the random walk with a restart algorithm to the SAN framework and showed improved performance. In this article, we extend the SAN framework with several leading supervised and unsupervised link-prediction algorithms and demonstrate performance improvement for each algorithm on both link prediction and attribute inference. Moreover, we make the novel observation that attribute inference can help inform link prediction, that is, link-prediction accuracy is further improved by first inferring missing attributes. We comprehensively evaluate these algorithms and compare them with other existing algorithms using a novel, large-scale Google&plus; dataset, which we make publicly available (&rbreve;lhttp:\/\/www.cs.berkeley.edu\/âˆ¼stevgong\/gplus.html)."}
