Using a graph-based formalism, the IFO model provides mechanisms for representing structured objects, and functional and ISA relationships between them. A number of fundamental results concerning semantic data modeling are obtained in the context of the IFO model. Notably, the types of object structure that can arise as a result of multiple uses of ISA relationships and object construction are described. Also, a natural, formal definition of update propagation is given, and it is shown that (under certain conditions) a correct update always exists."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14062","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14063","fieldValue":"zsoyolu, G."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14063","fieldValue":"zsoyolu, Z.

However, the relational database model, as defined by Codd, does not include set-valued attributes or aggregate functions. Recently, Klug extended the relational model by incorporating aggregate functions and by defining relational algebra and calculus languages.In this paper, relational algebra and relational calculus database query languages (as defined by Klug) are extended to manipulate set-valued attributes and to utilize aggregate functions. The expressive power of the extended languages is shown to be equivalent. We extend the relational algebra with three new operators, namely, pack, unpack, and aggregation-by-template. The extended languages form a theoretical framework for statistical database query languages."}
