Biological applications require an alignment step to map sequencing reads to the reference genome, before acquiring expected genomic information. This requirement makes alignment accuracy a key factor for effective biological interpretation. Normally, when accounting for measurement errors and single nucleotide polymorphisms, short read mappings with a few mismatches are generally considered acceptable. However, to further improve the efficiency of short-read sequencing alignment, we propose a method to retrieve additional reliably aligned reads (reads with more than a pre-defined number of mismatches), using a Bayesian-based approach. In this method, we first retrieve the sequence context around the mismatched nucleotides within the already aligned reads; these loci contain the genomic features where sequencing errors occur. Then, using the derived pattern, we evaluate the remaining (typically discarded) reads with more than the allowed number of mismatches, and calculate a score that represents the probability that a specific alignment is correct. This strategy allows the extraction of more reliably aligned reads, therefore improving alignment sensitivity.

Microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) is just one of the many mechanisms that can cause genomic destabilization that may lead to cancer. Although the mechanism for MMBIR remains unclear, it has been shown that MMBIR is typically associated with template-switching events. Currently, to our knowledge, there is no existing bioinformatics tool to detect these template-switching events. We have developed MMBIRFinder, a method that detects template-switching events associated with MMBIR from whole-genome sequenced data. MMBIRFinder uses a half-read alignment approach to identify potential regions of interest. Clustering of these potential regions helps narrow the search space to regions with strong evidence. Subsequent local alignments identify the template-switching events with single-nucleotide accuracy. Using simulated data, MMBIRFinder identified 83 percent of the MMBIR regions within a five nucleotide tolerance. Using real data, MMBIRFinder identified 16 MMBIR regions on a normal breast tissue data sample and 51 MMBIR regions on a triple-negative breast cancer tumor sample resulting in detection of 37 novel template-switching events. Finally, we identified template-switching events residing in the promoter region of seven genes that have been implicated in breast cancer.
