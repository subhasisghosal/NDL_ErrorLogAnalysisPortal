Our objectives are twofold. First, we aim to identify the nodes on the boundaries of a 3-D network, which serve as a key attribute that characterizes the network, especially in such geographic exploration tasks as terrain and underwater reconnaissance. Second, we construct locally planarized 2-manifold surfaces for inner and outer boundaries in order to enable available graph theory tools to be applied on 3-D surfaces, such as embedding, localization, partition, and greedy routing among many others. To achieve the first objective, we propose a Unit Ball Fitting (UBF) algorithm that discovers a majority of boundary nodes, followed by a refinement algorithm, named Isolated Fragment Filtering (IFF), to remove isolated nodes that are misinterpreted as boundary nodes. Based on the identified boundary nodes, we develop an algorithm that constructs a locally planarized triangular mesh surface for each 3-D boundary. Our proposed scheme is localized, requiring information within 1-hop neighborhood only. We further extend the schemes for online boundary detection in mobile sensor networks aiming to achieve low overhead. Our simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively identify boundary nodes and surfaces, even under high measurement errors."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10827","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10827","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10827","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10828","fieldValue":" A key problem in the control of packet-switched data networks is to schedule the data so that the queue sizes remain bounded over time. Scheduling policies have been developed in a number of different models that ensure network stability as long as no queue is inherently overloaded. However, this literature typically assumes that each server runs at a fixed maximum rate. Although this is optimal for clearing queue backlogs as fast as possible, it may be suboptimal in terms of energy consumption. Indeed, a lightly loaded server could operate at a lower rate, at least temporarily, to save energy. Within an energy-aware framework, a natural question is how stability and other performance measures such as delay are affected by the reduced processing rate of the servers. In this paper, we demonstrate the following results toward answering that question. Starting with the simplest case of a single server in isolation, we consider two types of rate adaptation policies that exhibit a tradeoff between queue size and energy usage. We also present a lower bound on the best such tradeoff that can possibly be achieved. Next, we study a general network environment and investigate the connectionless model for which connection paths can rapidly change over time. We propose a combination of the above rate adaptation policies with the standard Farthest-to-Go scheduling policy. This approach provides stability in the network setting while using an amount of energy that is within a bounded factor of the optimum."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10828","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10828","fieldValue":"ACM"}
