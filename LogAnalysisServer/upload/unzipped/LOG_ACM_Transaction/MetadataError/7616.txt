It is of paramount importance for many optimization problems, e.g., the maximum-lifetime multicast problem in multihop wireless networks, in the data networking community. We explore some important properties of this problem from a graph theory perspective and obtain a min-max-tree max-min-cut theorem, which provides a unified explanation for some important while separated results in the recent literature. We also apply the theorem to derive an algorithm that can construct a global optimal min-max multicast tree in a distributed fashion. In random networks with n nodes and m arcs, our theoretical analysis shows that the expected communication complexity of our distributed algorithm is in the order of O(m). Specifically, the average number of messages is 2(n-1-γ)-2 ln (n-1) + m at most, in which γ is the Euler constant. To our best knowledge, this is the first contribution that possesses the distributed and scalable properties for the min-max multicast problem and is especially desirable to the large-scale resource-limited multihop wireless networks, like sensor networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10041","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10041","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10041","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10042","fieldValue":" A framework for designing feedback-based scheduling algorithms is proposed for elegantly solving the notorious packet missequencing problem of a load-balanced switch. Unlike existing approaches, we show that the efforts made in load balancing and keeping packets in order can complement each other. Specifically, at each middle-stage port between the two switch fabrics of a load-balanced switch, only a single-packet buffer for each virtual output queueing (VOQ) is required. Although packets belonging to the same flow pass through different middle-stage VOQs, the delays they experience at different middle-stage ports will be identical. This is made possible by properly selecting and coordinating the two sequences of switch configurations to form a joint sequence with both staggered symmetry property and in-order packet delivery property. Based on the staggered symmetry property, an efficient feedback mechanism is designed to allow the right middle-stage port occupancy vector to be delivered to the right input port at the right time. As a result, the performance of load balancing as well as the switch throughput is significantly improved. We further extend this feedback mechanism to support the multicabinet implementation of a load-balanced switch, where the propagation delay between switch linecards and switch fabrics is nonnegligible. As compared to the existing load-balanced switch architectures and scheduling algorithms, our solutions impose a modest requirement on switch hardware, but consistently yield better delay-throughput performance. Last but not least, some extensions and refinements are made to address the scalability, implementation, and fairness issues of our solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10042","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10042","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10042","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10043","fieldValue":" Existing analytical methods to model multistage switch networks cannot be applied to the performance modeling of switch networks with phase-type and bursty traffic because of the problem of state-space explosion and unrealistic assumptions, e.g., uniform traffic and independent destination (UTID). This paper presents an approximate scheme to model and analyze such networks. First, a traffic aggregation technique is proposed to deal with phase-type and bursty traffic, including splitting and merging. For the aggregation of two bursty traffic, a closed-form solution is obtained for buffer state probabilities. For the aggregation of more bursty traffic, a recursive algorithm is derived in terms of the buffer size and number of inputs of a switch. Second, a switch decomposition technique is developed, by which the crossbar of a switch is decomposed from its preceding and s쳮ding buffers. In this way, a switch network of N inputs and outputs is converted to N tandem queues, for which the performance can be easily evaluated. Our extensive numerical and simulation examples have shown that the proposed scheme achieves satisfied accuracy and computational efficiency."}
