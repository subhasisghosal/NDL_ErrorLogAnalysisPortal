The original formulation had certain shortcomings that limited NCA's application to a wide class of network dynamics reconstruction problems, either because of limitations in the sample size or because of the stringent requirements imposed by the set of identifiability conditions. In addition, the performance characteristics of the method for various levels of data noise or in the presence of model inaccuracies were never investigated. In this article, the following aspects of NCA have been addressed, resulting in a set of extensions to the original framework: 1) The sufficient conditions on the a priori connectivity information (required for successful reconstructions via NCA) are made less stringent, allowing easier verification of whether a network topology is identifiable, as well as extending the class of identifiable systems. Such a result is accomplished by introducing a set of identifiability requirements that can be directly tested on the regulatory architecture, rather than on specific instances of the system matrix. 2) The two-stage least square iterative procedure used in NCA is proven to identify stationary points of the likelihood function, under Gaussian noise assumption, thus reinforcing the statistical foundations of the method. 3) A framework for the simultaneous reconstruction of multiple regulatory subnetworks is introduced, thus overcoming one of the critical limitations of the original formulation of the decomposition, for example, occurring for poorly sampled data (typical of microarray experiments). A set of monte carlo simulations we conducted with synthetic data suggests that the approach is indeed capable of accurately reconstructing regulatory signals when these are the input of large-scale networks that satisfy the suggested identifiability criteria, even under fairly noisy conditions. The sensitivity of the reconstructed signals to inaccuracies in the hypothesized network topology is also investigated. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for the simultaneous reconstruction of multiple regulatory subnetworks from the same data set with a successful application of the technique to gene expression measurements of the bacterium Escherichia coli."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4215","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4215","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4215","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4216","fieldValue":" The assignment of orthologous genes between a pair of genomes is a fundamental and challenging problem in comparative genomics. Existing methods that assign orthologs based on the similarity between DNA or protein sequences may make erroneous assignments when sequence similarity does not clearly delineate the evolutionary relationship among genes of the same families. In this paper, we present a new approach to ortholog assignment that takes into account both sequence similarity and evolutionary events at a genome level, where orthologous genes are assumed to correspond to each other in the most parsimonious evolving scenario under genome rearrangement. First, the problem is formulated as that of computing the signed reversal distance with duplicates between the two genomes of interest. Then, the problem is decomposed into two new optimization problems, called minimum common partition and maximum cycle decomposition, for which efficient heuristic algorithms are given. Following this approach, we have implemented a high-throughput system for assigning orthologs on a genome scale, called SOAR, and tested it on both simulated data and real genome sequence data. Compared to a recent ortholog assignment method based entirely on homology search (called INPARANOID), SOAR shows a marginally better performance in terms of sensitivity on the real data set because it is able to identify several correct orthologous pairs that are missed by INPARANOID. The simulation results demonstrate that SOAR, in general, performs better than the iterated exemplar algorithm in terms of computing the reversal distance and assigning correct orthologs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4216","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4216","fieldValue":"ACM"}
