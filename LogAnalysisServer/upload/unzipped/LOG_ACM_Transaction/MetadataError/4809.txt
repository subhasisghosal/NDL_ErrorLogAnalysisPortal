DRM systems generally involve multiple parties such as owner, distributors, and consumers. The owner issues redistribution licenses to its distributors. The distributors in turn using their received redistribution licenses can generate and issue new redistribution licenses to other distributors and new usage licenses to consumers. As a part of rights violation detection, these newly generated licenses must be validated by a validation authority against the redistribution license used to generate them. The validation of these newly generated licenses becomes quite complex when there exist multiple redistribution licenses for a media with the distributors. In such cases, the validation process requires validation using an exponential number (to the number of redistribution licenses) of validation inequalities and each validation inequality may contain up to an exponential number of summation terms. This makes the validation process computationally intensive and necessitates to do the validation efficiently. To overcome this, we propose validation tree, a prefix-tree-based validation method to do the validation efficiently. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our proposed technique reduces the validation time significantly."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25463","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25463","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25220","fieldValue":"Issue 3s(Special section of best papers of ACM multimedia 2011, and special section on 3D mobile multimedia), September 2012"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25464","fieldValue":"Gatica-Perez, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25464","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25464","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25465","fieldValue":" This article presents a psychophysical study that measures the perceptual thresholds of a new factor called Color-plus-Depth Level-of-Details (CZLoD) peculiar to polygon-based 3D tele-immersive video. The results demonstrate the existence of Just Noticeable Degradation and Just Unacceptable Degradation thresholds on the factor. In light of the results, we design and implement a real-time perception-based quality adaptor for 3D tele-immersive video. Our experimental results show that the adaptation scheme can reduce resource usage (e.g., CPU cycles) while considerably enhancing the overall perceived visual quality. Our analysis confirms the potential temporal and spatial performance benefits achievable with CZLoD adaptation."}
