Contextual information is important for improving the performance of VAD at low signal-to-noise ratios. Here we explore contextual information by machine learning methods at three levels. At the top level, we employ an ensemble learning framework, named multi-resolution stacking (MRS), which is a stack of ensemble classifiers. Each classifier in a building block inputs the concatenation of the predictions of its lower building blocks and the expansion of the raw acoustic feature by a given window (called a resolution). At the middle level, we describe a base classifier in MRS, named boosted deep neural network (bDNN). bDNN first generates multiple base predictions from different contexts of a single frame by only one DNN and then aggregates the base predictions for a better prediction of the frame, and it is different from computationally-expensive boosting methods that train ensembles of classifiers for multiple base predictions. At the bottom level, we employ the multi-resolution cochleagram feature, which incorporates the contextual information by concatenating the cochleagram features at multiple spectrotemporal resolutions. Experimental results show that the MRS-based VAD outperforms other VADs by a considerable margin. Moreover, when trained on a large amount of noise types and a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, the MRS-based VAD demonstrates surprisingly good generalization performance on unseen test scenarios, approaching the performance with noise-dependent training."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3996","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3996","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3997","fieldValue":"Turan, MA Tutekin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3997","fieldValue":" In this paper, we propose a new statistical enhancement system for throat microphone recordings through source and filter separation. Throat microphones (TM) are skin-attached piezoelectric sensors that can capture speech sound signals in the form of tissue vibrations. Due to their limited bandwidth, TM recorded speech suffers from intelligibility and naturalness. In this paper, we investigate learning phone-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based statistical mappings using parallel recordings of acoustic microphone (AM) and TM for enhancement of the spectral envelope and excitation signals of the TM speech. The proposed mappings address the phone-dependent variability of tissue conduction with TM recordings. While the spectral envelope mapping estimates the line spectral frequency (LSF) representation of AM from TM recordings, the excitation mapping is constructed based on the spectral energy difference (SED) of AM and TM excitation signals. The excitation enhancement is modeled as an estimation of the SED features from the TM signal. The proposed enhancement system is evaluated using both objective and subjective tests. Objective evaluations are performed with the log-spectral distortion (LSD), the wideband perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and mean-squared error (MSE) metrics. Subjective evaluations are performed with an A\/B comparison test. Experimental results indicate that the proposed phone-dependent mappings exhibit enhancements over phone-independent mappings. Furthermore enhancement of the TM excitation through statistical mappings of the SED features introduces significant objective and subjective performance improvements to the enhancement of TM recordings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3997","fieldValue":"ACM"}
