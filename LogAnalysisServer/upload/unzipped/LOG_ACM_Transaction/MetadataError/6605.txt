Unlike the traditional FiDi game, where image pairs (source image and target image) with five different patches are manually produced by professional game developers, the proposed Personalized FiDi (P-FiDi) electronic game can be played in a fully automatic Snap & Play mode. Snap means that players first take photos with their digital cameras. The newly captured photos are used as source images and fed into the P-FiDi system to autogenerate the counterpart target images for users to play. Four steps are adopted to autogenerate target images: enhancing the visual quality of source images, extracting some changeable patches from the source image, selecting the most suitable combination of changeable patches and difference styles for the image, and generating the differences on the target image with state-of-the-art image processing techniques. In addition, the P-FiDi game can be easily redesigned for the im-game advertising. Extensive experiments show that the P-FiDi electronic game is satisfying in terms of player experience, seamless advertisement, and technical feasibility."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7595","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7595","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7596","fieldValue":" This article deals with a decision-making problem concerning an agent who wants to choose a partner from multiple candidates for long-term collaboration. To choose the best partner, the agent can rely on prior information he knows about the candidates. However, to improve his decision, he can request additional information from information sources. Nonetheless, acquiring information from external information sources about candidates may be biased due to different personalities of the agent searching for a partner and the information source. In addition, information may be costly. Considering the bias and the cost of the information sources, the optimization problem addressed in this article is threefold: (1) determining the necessary amount of additional information, (2) selecting information sources from which to request the information, and (3) choosing the candidates on whom to request the additional information. We propose a heuristic to solve this optimization problem. The results of experiments on simulated and real-world domains demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7596","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7596","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7597","fieldValue":"Hoi, Steven C H"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7597","fieldValue":"Hua, Xian-Sheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7597","fieldValue":" The pervasive usage and reach of social media have attracted a surge of attention in the multimedia research community. Community discovery from social media has therefore become an important yet challenging issue. However, due to the subjective generating process, the explicitly observed communities (e.g., group-user and user-user relationship) are often noisy and incomplete in nature. This paper presents a novel approach to discovering communities from social media, including the group membership and user friend structure, by exploring a low-rank matrix recovery technique. In particular, we take Flickr as one exemplary social media platform. We first model the observed indicator matrix of the Flickr community as a summation of a low-rank true matrix and a sparse error matrix. We then formulate an optimization problem by regularizing the true matrix to coincide with the available rich context and content (i.e., photos and their associated tags). An iterative algorithm is developed to recover the true community indicator matrix. The proposed approach leads to a variety of social applications, including community visualization, interest group refinement, friend suggestion, and influential user identification. The evaluations on a large-scale testbed, consisting of 4,919 Flickr users, 1,467 interest groups, and over five million photos, show that our approach opens a new yet effective perspective to solve social network problems with sparse learning technique. Despite being focused on Flickr, our technique can be applied in any other social media community."}
