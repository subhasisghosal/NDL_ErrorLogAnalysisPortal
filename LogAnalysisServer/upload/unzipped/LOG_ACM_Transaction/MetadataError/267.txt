Precisely, we take as input a â\u20ACœweak modelâ\u20AC?: a comprehension category, equipped with structure corresponding to the desired logical constructions. We assume throughout that the base category is close to locally Cartesian closed: specifically, that products and certain exponentials exist. Beyond this, we require only that the logical structure should be weakly stableâ\u20AC\u201Da pure existence statement, not involving any specific choice of structure, weaker than standard categorical Beck--Chevalley conditions, and holding in the now standard homotopy-theoretic models of type theory. Given such a comprehension category, we construct an equivalent split one whose logical structure is strictly stable under reindexing. This yields an interpretation of type theory with the chosen constructors. The model is adapted from Voevodsky's use of universes for coherence, and at the level of fibrations is a classical construction of Giraud. It may be viewed in terms of local universes or delayed substitutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11752","fieldValue":"Heule, Marijn J H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11752","fieldValue":" Clique-width is a graph invariant that has been widely studied in combinatorics and computational logic. Computing the clique-width of a graph is an intricate problem, because the exact clique-width is not known even for very small graphs. We present a new method for computing clique-width via an encoding to propositional satisfiability (SAT), which is then evaluated by a SAT solver. Our encoding is based on a reformulation of clique-width in terms of partitions that utilizes an efficient encoding of cardinality constraints. Our SAT-based method is the first to discover the exact clique-width of various small graphs, including famous named graphs from the literature as well as random graphs of various density. With our method, we determined the smallest graphs that require a small predescribed clique-width. We further show how our method can be modified to compute the linear clique-width of graphs, a variant of clique-width that has recently received considerable attention. In an appendix, we provide certificates for tight upper bounds for the clique-width and linear clique-width of famous named graphs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11753","fieldValue":" Many decision problems in formal verification and design can be suitably formulated in game-theoretic terms. This is the case for the model checking of open and closed systems and both controller and reactive synthesis. Interpreted in this context, these problems require one to find a strategy (i.e., a plan) to force the system to fulfill some desired goal, no matter what the opponent (e.g., the environment) does. A strategy essentially constrains the possible behaviors of the system to those that are compatible with the decisions dictated by the plan itself. Therefore, finding a strategy to meet some goal basically reduces to identifying a portion of the model of interest (i.e., one of its substructures) that satisfies that goal. In this view, the ability to reason about substructures becomes a crucial aspect for several fundamental problems. In this article, we present and study a new branching-time temporal logic, called Substructure Temporal Logic (STL &ast; for short), whose distinctive feature is to allow for quantifying over the possible substructure of a given structure. The logic is obtained by adding four new temporal-like operators to CTL &ast;, whose interpretation is given relative to the partial order induced by a suitable substructure relation. STL &ast; turns out to be very expressive and allows one to capture in a very natural way many well-known problems, such as module checking, reactive synthesis, and reasoning about games in a wide sense. A formal account of the model-theoretic properties of the new logic and results about (un)decidability and complexity of related decision problems are also provided."}
