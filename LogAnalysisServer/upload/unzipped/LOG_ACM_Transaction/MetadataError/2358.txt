Using one-dimensional binary van der Corput sequences, we construct two-dimensional LD point sets, and rearrange them to match a target spectral profile while preserving their low discrepancy. We store the rearrangement information in a compact lookup table that can be used to produce arbitrarily large point sets. We evaluate our technique and compare it to the state-of-the-art sampling approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17744","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Shenzhen University and SIAT (Huang, Hui); University of Konstanz (Ahmed, Abdalla G M); NLPR, Institute of Automation, CAS (Guo, Jianwei; Yan, Dong-Ming); Universit&#233; de Lyon (Perrier, Hlne; Coeurjolly, David; Ostromoukhov, Victor); University of Konstanz and SIAT (Deussen, Oliver)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17745","fieldValue":"Bremer, Peer-Timo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17745","fieldValue":" A common solution to reducing visible aliasing artifacts in image reconstruction is to employ sampling patterns with a blue noise power spectrum. These sampling patterns can prevent discernible artifacts by replacing them with incoherent noise. Here, we propose a new family of blue noise distributions, Stair blue noise, which is mathematically tractable and enables parameter optimization to obtain the optimal sampling distribution. Furthermore, for a given sample budget, the proposed blue noise distribution achieves a significantly larger alias-free low-frequency region compared to existing approaches, without introducing visible artifacts in the mid-frequencies. We also develop a new sample synthesis algorithm that benefits from the use of an unbiased spatial statistics estimator and efficient optimization strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17745","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17745","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17746","fieldValue":"Akenine-Mller, Tomas"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17746","fieldValue":" We present a texture space caching and reconstruction system for Monte Carlo ray tracing. Our system gathers and filters shading on-demand, including querying secondary rays, directly within a filter footprint around the current shading point. We shade on local grids in texture space with primary visibility decoupled from shading. Unique filters can be applied per material, where any terms of the shader can be chosen to be included in each kernel. This is a departure from recent screen space image reconstruction techniques, which typically use a single, complex kernel with a set of large auxiliary guide images as input. We show a number of high-performance use cases for our system, including interactive denoising of Monte Carlo ray tracing with motion\/defocus blur, spatial and temporal shading reuse, cached product importance sampling, and filters based on linear regression in texture space."}
