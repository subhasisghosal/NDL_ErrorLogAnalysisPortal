This demands a routing path to be constructed traversing all sensors in that area, which is also needed to linearize the network. In this article, we present SURF, a Space filling cURve construction scheme for high genus three-dimensional (3D) surFace WSNs, yielding a traversal path provably aperiodic (that is, any node is covered at most a constant number of times). SURF first utilizes the hop-count distance function to construct the iso-contour in discrete settings, and then it uses the concept of the Reeb graph and the maximum cut set to divide the network into different regions. Finally, it conducts a novel serial traversal scheme, enabling the traversal within and between regions. To the best of our knowledge, SURF is the first high genus 3D surface WSN targeted and pure connectivity-based solution for linearizing the networks. It is fully distributed and highly scalable, requiring a nearly constant storage and communication cost per node in the network. To incorporate adaptive density of the constructed space filling curve, we also design a second algorithm, called $SURF^+$, which makes use of parameterized spiral-like curves to cover the 3D surface and thus can yield a multiresolution SFC adapting to different requirements on travel budget or fusion delay. The application combining both algorithms for in-network data storage and retrieval in high genus 3D surface WSNs is also presented. Extensive simulations on several representative networks demonstrate that both algorithms work well on high genus 3D surface WSNs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21619","fieldValue":"Hossain, A.

A centralised NDM was first conceptualised in our initial published work utilising the spatial diversity among multiple paths to ensure robustness against localised poor channel quality or node failures. Here, we further introduce a distributed version of our NDM algorithm adapting to the low-power and lossy network (LLN) characteristics. We implement our distributed NDM algorithm in Contiki OS on top of LOADngâ\u20AC\u201Da lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance Vector Routing protocol. We compare this implementation's performance with a standard IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL), and also with basic LOADng, running in the Cooja simulator. Standard performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end latency, overhead and average routing table size are identified for the comparison. The results and observations are provided considering a few different application traffic patterns, which serve to quantify the improvements in robustness arising from NDM. The results are confirmed by experiments using a public sensor network testbed with over 100 nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21619","fieldValue":"RPL"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21620","fieldValue":" Advances in micro-electronics and miniaturized mechanical systems are redefining the scope and extent of the energy constraints found in battery-operated wireless sensor networks (WSNs). On one hand, ambient energy harvesting may prolong the systemsâ\u20AC™ lifetime or possibly enable perpetual operation. On the other hand, wireless energy transfer allows systems to decouple the energy sources from the sensing locations, enabling deployments previously unfeasible. As a result of applying these technologies to WSNs, the assumption of a finite energy budget is replaced with that of potentially infinite, yet intermittent, energy supply, profoundly impacting the design, implementation, and operation of WSNs. This article discusses these aspects by surveying paradigmatic examples of existing solutions in both fields and by reporting on real-world experiences found in the literature. The discussion is instrumental in providing a foundation for selecting the most appropriate energy harvesting or wireless transfer technology based on the application at hand. We conclude by outlining research directions originating from the fundamental change of perspective that energy harvesting and wireless transfer bring about."}
