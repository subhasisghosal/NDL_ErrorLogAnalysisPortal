This algorithm is used to construct an O(n4) algorithm to generate triangulations of a simple polygon at random with a uniform probability distribution. The problem of counting triangulations of a simple polygon is then related to existing problems in graph theory."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24731","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24731","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24732","fieldValue":"ACM"}
