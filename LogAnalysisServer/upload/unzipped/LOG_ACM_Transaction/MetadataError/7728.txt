Our work encompasses several different user association policies: rate-optimal, throughput-optimal, delay-optimal, and load-equalizing, which we collectively denote Î±-optimal user association. We prove that the optimal load vector Ï?* that minimizes a generalized system performance function is the fixed point of a certain mapping. Based on this mapping, we propose and analyze an iterative distributed user association policy that adapts to spatial traffic loads and converges to a globally optimal allocation.We then address admission control policies for the case where the system is overloaded. For an appropriate systemlevel cost function, the optimal admission control policy blocks all flows at cells edges. However, providing a minimum level of connectivity to all spatial locations might be desirable. To this end, a location-dependent random blocking and user association policy are proposed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10267","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10267","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10268","fieldValue":" This paper deals with a novel forwarding scheme for wireless sensor networks aimed at combining low computational complexity and high performance in terms of energy efficiency and reliability. The proposed approach relies on a packet-splitting algorithm based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and is characterized by a simple modular division between integers. An analytical model for estimating the energy efficiency of the scheme is presented, and several practical issues such as the effect of unreliable channels, topology changes, andMACoverhead are discussed. The results obtained show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional approaches in terms of power saving, simplicity, and fair distribution of energy consumption among all nodes in the network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10268","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
