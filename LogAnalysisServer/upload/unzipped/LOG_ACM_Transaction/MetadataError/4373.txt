We tackle two core issues that are central to query translation: how to exploit context to generate more accurate translations and how to preserve ambiguity that may be present in the original query, thereby retaining a diverse set of translation alternatives. These two considerations are often in tension since ambiguity in natural language is typically resolved by exploiting context, but effective retrieval requires striking the right balance. We propose two novel query translation approaches: the grammar-based approach extracts translation probabilities from translation grammars, while the decoder-based approach takes advantage of n-best translation hypotheses. Both are context-sensitive, in contrast to a baseline context-insensitive approach that uses bilingual dictionaries for word-by-word translation. Experimental results show that by â\u20ACœopening upâ\u20AC? modern statistical machine translation systems, we can access intermediate representations that yield high retrieval effectiveness. By combining evidence from multiple sources, we demonstrate significant improvements over competitive baselines on standard cross-language information retrieval test collections. In addition to effectiveness, the efficiency of our techniques are explored as well."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24109","fieldValue":"Exploiting Representations from Statistical Machine Translation for Cross-Language Information Retrieval"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24109","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24109","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1249","fieldValue":" We present schemes for providing anonymous transactions while privacy and anonymity are preserved, providing user's anonymous authentication in distributed networks such as the Internet. We first present a practical scheme for anonymous transactions while the transaction resolution is assisted by a Trusted Authority. This practical scheme is extended to a theoretical scheme where a Trusted Authority is not involved in the transaction resolution. Both schemes assume that all the players interact over anonymous secure channels. Given authority that generates for each player hard to produce evidence EVID (e.g., problem instance with or without a solution) to each player, the identity of a user U is defined by the ability to prove possession of aforementioned evidence. We use zero-knowledge proof techniques to repeatedly identify U by providing a proof that U has evidence EVID, without revealing EVID, therefore avoiding identity theft. In both schemes the authority provides each user with a unique random string. A player U may produce a unique user name and password for each other player S using a one-way function over the random string and the IP address of S. The player does not have to maintain any information in order to reproduce the user name and password used for accessing a player S. Moreover, the player U may execute transactions with a group of players $S^U in two phases; in the first phase the player interacts with each server without revealing information concerning its identity and without possibly identifying linkability among the servers in SU. In the second phase the player allows linkability and therefore transaction commitment with all servers in SU$, while preserving anonymity (for future transactions)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24110","fieldValue":"Collins-Thompson, Kevyn"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24110","fieldValue":" Current research on Web search has focused on optimizing and evaluating single queries. However, a significant fraction of user queries are part of more complex tasks [Jones and Klinkner 2008] which span multiple queries across one or more search sessions [Liu and Belkin 2010; Kotov et al. 2011]. An ideal search engine would not only retrieve relevant results for a user's particular query but also be able to identify when the user is engaged in a more complex task and aid the user in completing that task [Morris et al. 2008; Agichtein et al. 2012]. Toward optimizing whole-session or task relevance, we characterize and address the problem of intrinsic diversity (ID) in retrieval [Radlinski et al. 2009], a type of complex task that requires multiple interactions with current search engines. Unlike existing work on extrinsic diversity [Carbonell and Goldstein 1998; Zhai et al. 2003; Chen and Karger 2006] that deals with ambiguity in intent across multiple users, ID queries often have little ambiguity in intent but seek content covering a variety of aspects on a shared theme. In such scenarios, the underlying needs are typically exploratory, comparative, or breadth-oriented in nature. We identify and address three key problems for ID retrieval: identifying authentic examples of ID tasks from post-hoc analysis of behavioral signals in search logs; learning to identify initiator queries that mark the start of an ID search task; and given an initiator query, predicting which content to prefetch and rank."}
