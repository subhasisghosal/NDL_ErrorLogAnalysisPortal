{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21533","fieldValue":" Lossy temporal compression is key for energy-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where the imperfect reconstruction of the signal is often acceptable at the data collector, subject to some maximum error tolerance. In this article, we evaluate a number of selected lossy compression methods from the literature and extensively analyze their performance in terms of compression efficiency, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Specifically, we first carry out a performance evaluation of existing and new compression schemes, considering linear, autoregressive, FFT-\/DCT- and wavelet-based models , by looking at their performance as a function of relevant signal statistics. Second, we obtain formulas through numerical fittings to gauge their overall energy consumption and signal representation accuracy. Third, we evaluate the benefits that lossy compression methods bring about in interference-limited multihop networks, where the channel access is a source of inefficiency due to collisions and transmission scheduling. Our results reveal that the DCT-based schemes are the best option in terms of compression efficiency but are inefficient in terms of energy consumption. Instead, linear methods lead to substantial savings in terms of energy expenditure by, at the same time, leading to satisfactory compression ratios, reduced network delay, and increased reliability performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21533","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21533","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21534","fieldValue":"Pomalaza-Rez, Carlos"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21534","fieldValue":" A cross-layer optimization approach for the physical and medium access control layers of wireless sensor networks is introduced in this article. This approach includes a Markov chain model, simulations, and analytical derivations that are applied to the analysis of sensor networks using impulse radio ultra-wideband signals with noncoherent energy detection. This type of communication system has low-power transmission requirements and noise like signal characteristics with low interference to other wireless systems. The energy efficiency of different Reed-Solomon code rates and uncoded case are studied in a star topology network, where slotted Aloha, as defined in the IEEE 802.15.4a standard, is used as the medium access protocol. Analytical and simulation results clearly show the potential energy gains that can be achieved with the proposed optimization approach that can be also used in the evaluation and optimization of other combinations of physical and medium access control protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21535","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a novel distributed separate coding (DSC) scheme for continuous data collection in wireless sensor networks with a mobile base station (mBS). By separately encoding a certain number of data segments in a combined segment and doing decoding-free data replacement in the buffers of each sensor node, the DSC scheme is shown as an efficient method for continuously collecting data segments with a high success ratio. The proposed DSC scheme has a salient feature: with a minimum buffer size 2 in each sensor node, by querying any mâˆ\u20191 sensor nodes, the mBS can reconstruct the m latest data segments with high probability, where m is the number of latest data segments in a time interval t in which n(t) (mâ\u2030¤ n(t)) data segments are generated. The necessary storage space in each sensor node can be adjusted by changing the number of sensor nodes queried by the mBS. Furthermore, the transmission cost for data submission to the mBS can be reduced with some additional storage space in each sensor node. The comprehensive performance evaluation has been conducted through computer simulation. It is shown that the proposed DSC scheme outperforms the existing scheme significantly."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21535","fieldValue":"ACM"}
