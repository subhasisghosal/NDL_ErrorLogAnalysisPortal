Hierarchical routing is essential for large networks such as the Internet inter\/intra-domain routing hierarchy and the Private Network to Node Interface (PNNI) standard. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient and accurate analytical model for evaluating the performance of hierarchical networks with multiple classes of traffic. A performance analysis model with considering multiple classes of traffic, the complexity of analytical and explosion of computation will be extremely increased, and hence, result in inaccurate analytical. The issue of multiple classes of traffic has to be addressed in performance analysis model. In this paper, we first study the reduced load approximation model for loss networks, and then propose a novel performance evaluation model for large networks with multirate hierarchical routing. The hierarchical evaluation model is based on decomposing a hierarchical route into several analytic hierarchical segments. Once the blockings of these hierarchical segments are accurately determined, the blocking of the hierarchical path can be estimated accurately from these segments blocking. Numerical results indicate that the proposed hierarchical reduced load approximation yields quite accurate blocking probabilities as compared to that of simulation results. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed hierarchical reduced load approximation heuristic is independent of the blocking or the offered traffic load. Finally, we also draw some remarks on the convergence of the reduced load based approximation analysis model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9292","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9292","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8359","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9293","fieldValue":" Attempts to generalize the Internet's point-to-point communication abstraction to provide services like multicast, anycast, and mobility have faced challenging technical problems and deployment barriers. To ease the deployment of such services, this paper proposes a general, overlay-based Internet Indirection Infrastructure (i3) that offers a rendezvous-based communication abstraction. Instead of explicitly sending a packet to a destination, each packet is associated with an identifier; this identifier is then used by the receiver to obtain delivery of the packet. This level of indirection decouples the act of sending from the act of receiving, and allows i3 to efficiently support a wide variety of fundamental communication services. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we have designed and built a prototype based on the Chord lookup protocol."}
