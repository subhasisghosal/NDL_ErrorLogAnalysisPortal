We first formulate the parameter identification problem as a new maximum a posteriori probability estimation problem so that prior information can be incorporated as regularization terms to reduce the large estimation variance of the high dimensional estimation problem. Under this framework, sparsity and temporal consistency of the model parameters are imposed using L1-regularization and novel continuity constraints, respectively. The resulting problem is solved using the L-BFGS method with the initial guess obtained from the partial least squares method. A novel forward validation measure is also proposed for the selection of regularization parameters, based on both forward and current prediction errors. The proposed method is evaluated using a synthetic benchmark testing data and a publicly available yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle microarray data. For the latter particularly, a number of significant genes identified at different timepoints are found to be biological significant according to previous findings in biological experiments. These suggest that the proposed approach may serve as a valuable tool for inferring time-varying gene regulatory networks in biological studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5189","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/5189","fieldValue":"L<inf>1<\/inf>-regularization"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5189","fieldValue":"A maximum a posteriori probability and time-varying approach for inferring gene regulatory networks from time course gene microarray data"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5189","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5189","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5190","fieldValue":" Analysis of DNA sequence motifs is becoming increasingly important in the study of gene regulation, and the identification of motif in DNA sequences is a complex problem in computational biology. Motif discovery has attracted the attention of more and more researchers, and varieties of algorithms have been proposed. Most existing motif discovery algorithms fix the motif's length as one of the input parameters. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to identify the optimal length of the motif and the optimal motif with that length, through an iteration process on increasing length numbers. For each fixed length, a modified genetic algorithm (GA) is used for finding the optimal motif with that length. Three operators are used in the modified GA: Mutation that is similar to the one used in usual GA but is modified to avoid local optimum in our case, and Addition and Deletion that are proposed by us for the problem. A criterion is given for singling out the optimal length in the increasing motif's lengths. We call this method AMDILM (an algorithm for motif discovery with iteration on lengths of motifs). The experiments on simulated data and real biological data show that AMDILM can accurately identify the optimal motif length. Meanwhile, the optimal motifs discovered by AMDILM are consistent with the real ones and are similar with the motifs obtained by the three well-known methods: Gibbs Sampler, MEME and Weeder."}
