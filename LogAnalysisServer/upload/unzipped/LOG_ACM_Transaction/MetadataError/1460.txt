We describe a prototype stereo display comprising two independent fixed-viewpoint volumetric displays. Like autostereoscopic volumetric displays, fixed-viewpoint volumetric displays generate near-correct focus cues without tracking eye position, because light comes from sources at the correct focal distances. (In our prototype, from three image planes at different physical distances.) Unlike autostereoscopic volumetric displays, however, fixed-viewpoint volumetric displays retain the qualities of modern projective graphics: view-dependent lighting effects such as occlusion, specularity, and reflection are correctly depicted; modern graphics processor and 2-D display technology can be utilized; and realistic fields of view and depths of field can be implemented. While not a practical solution for general-purpose viewing, our prototype display is a proof of concept and a platform for ongoing vision research. The design, implementation, and verification of this stereo display are described, including a novel technique of filtering along visual lines using 1-D texture mapping."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15467","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15468","fieldValue":" Three-dimensional TV is expected to be the next revolution in the history of television. We implemented a 3D TV prototype system with real-time acquisition, transmission, and 3D display of dynamic scenes. We developed a distributed, scalable architecture to manage the high computation and bandwidth demands. Our system consists of an array of cameras, clusters of network-connected PCs, and a multi-projector 3D display. Multiple video streams are individually encoded and sent over a broadband network to the display. The 3D display shows high-resolution (1024 Ã\u2014 768) stereoscopic color images for multiple viewpoints without special glasses. We implemented systems with rear-projection and front-projection lenticular screens. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of our 3D TV system, including an examination of design choices and tradeoffs. We present the calibration and image alignment procedures that are necessary to achieve good image quality. We present qualitative results and some early user feedback. We believe this is the first real-time end-to-end 3D TV system with enough views and resolution to provide a truly immersive 3D experience."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15468","fieldValue":"3D TV: a scalable system for real-time acquisition, transmission, and autostereoscopic display of dynamic scenes"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15468","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15468","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15469","fieldValue":"McDowall, Ian"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15469","fieldValue":" Confocal microscopy is a family of imaging techniques that employ focused patterned illumination and synchronized imaging to create cross-sectional views of 3D biological specimens. In this paper, we adapt confocal imaging to large-scale scenes by replacing the optical apertures used in microscopy with arrays of real or virtual video projectors and cameras. Our prototype implementation uses a video projector, a camera, and an array of mirrors. Using this implementation, we explore confocal imaging of partially occluded environments, such as foliage, and weakly scattering environments, such as murky water. We demonstrate the ability to selectively image any plane in a partially occluded environment, and to see further through murky water than is otherwise possible. By thresholding the confocal images, we extract mattes that can be used to selectively illuminate any plane in the scene."}
