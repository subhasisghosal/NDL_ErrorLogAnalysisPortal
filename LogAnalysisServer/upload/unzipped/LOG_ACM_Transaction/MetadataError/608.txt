Low-power datapath scheduling using multiple supply voltages has been well researched. In this work, we develop new datapath scheduling algorithms that use multiple supply voltages and dynamic frequency clocking in a coordinated manner in order to reduce the energy consumption of datapath circuits. In dynamic frequency clocking, the functional units can be operated at different frequencies depending on the computations occurring within the datapath during a given clock cycle. The strategy is to schedule high-energy units, such as multipliers at lower frequencies, so that they can be operated at lower voltages to reduce energy consumption and the low-energy units, such as adders at higher frequencies, to compensate for speed. The proposed time- and resource-constrained algorithms have been applied to various high-level synthesis benchmark circuits under different time and resource constraints. The experimental results show significant reduction in energy for both the algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12921","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12922","fieldValue":" This article addresses the problem of voltage scheduling in unpredictable situations. The voltage scheduling problem assigns voltages to operations such that the power is minimized under a clock delay constraint. In the presence of unpredictabilities, meeting the clock latency constraint cannot be guaranteed. This article proposes a novel risk management based technique to solve this problem. Here, the risk management paradigm assigns a quantified value to the amount of risk the designer is willing to take on the clock cycle constraint. The algorithm then assigns voltages in order to meet the expected value of clock cycle constraint while keeping the maximum delay within the specified â\u20ACœriskâ\u20AC? and minimizing the power. The proposed algorithm is based on dynamic programming and is optimal for trees. Experimental results show that the traditional voltage scheduling approach is incapable of handling unpredictabilities. Our approach is capable of generating an effective tradeoff between power and â\u20ACœriskâ\u20AC?: the more the risk, the less the power. The results show that a small increase in design risk positively affects the power dissipation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12922","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12922","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12923","fieldValue":" Many high-end DSP processors employ both multiple memory banks and heterogeneous register files to improve performance and power consumption. The complexity of such architectures presents a great challenge to compiler design. In this article, we present an approach for variable partitioning and instruction scheduling to maximally exploit the benefits provided by such architectures. Our approach is built on a novel graph model which strives to capture both performance and power demands. We propose an algorithm to iteratively find the variable partition such that the maximum energy saving is achieved while satisfying the given performance constraint. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12923","fieldValue":"ACM"}
