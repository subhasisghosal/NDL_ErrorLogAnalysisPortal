We recruited 97 iPhone users from metropolitan areas and collected statistics on their WiFi connectivity during a two-and-a-halfweek period in February 2010. Our trace-driven simulation using the acquired whole-day traces indicates that WiFi already offloads about 65% of the total mobile data traffic and saves 55% of battery power without using any delayed transmission. If data transfers can be delayed with some deadline until users enter a WiFi zone, substantial gains can be achieved only when the deadline is fairly larger than tens of minutes. With 100-s delays, the achievable gain is less than only 2%-3%, whereas with 1 h or longer deadlines, traffic and energy saving gains increase beyond 29% and 20%, respectively. These results are in contrast to the substantial gain (20%-33%) reported by the existing work even for 100-s delayed transmission using traces taken from transit buses or war-driving. In addition, a distribution model-based simulator and a theoretical framework that enable analytical studies of the average performance of offloading are proposed. These tools are useful for network providers to obtain a rough estimate on the average performance of offloading for a given WiFi deployment condition."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10442","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10443","fieldValue":" Quantifying and querying network reachability is important for security monitoring and auditing as well as many aspects of network management such as troubleshooting, maintenance, and design. Although attempts to model network reachability have been made, feasible solutions to computing network reachability have remained unknown. In this paper, we propose a suite of algorithms for quantifying reachability based on network configurations [mainly Access Control Lists (ACLs)] as well as solutions for querying network reachability. We present a network reachability model that considers connectionless and connection-oriented transport protocols, stateless and stateful routers\/ firewalls, static and dynamic NAT, PAT, IP tunneling, etc. We implemented the algorithms in our network reachability tool called Quarnet and conducted experiments on a university network. Experimental results show that the offline computation of reachability matrices takes a few hours, and the online processing of a reachability query takes 0.075 s on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10443","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10443","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10443","fieldValue":"ACM"}
