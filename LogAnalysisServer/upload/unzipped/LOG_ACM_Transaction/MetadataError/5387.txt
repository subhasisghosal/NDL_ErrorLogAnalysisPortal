The introduction of a virtual robot restructures the formation control problem into a tracking control problem between the virtual reference robot and follower robots. A novel obstacle avoidance approach is proposed based upon the scaling of whole (partial) formation corresponding to a centralized (distributed) framework. For the distributed environment with limited communication, our approach utilized proportional-integral average consensus estimators, whereby information from each robot diffuses through the communication network. The theoretical contribution is to determine the time constant involved in the diffusion process, which can affect overall system performance. The asymptotic convergence of follower robots to the position and orientation of the reference robot is ensured using the Lyapunov function. The new technique is tested with complete, limited, and no information availability. Several simulation results are provided that demonstrate the formation control and obstacle avoidance for multirobots using the proposed scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1352","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1352","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4552","fieldValue":" Large amount of population-scale genetic variation data are being collected in populations. One potentially important biological problem is to infer the population genealogical history from these genetic variation data. Partly due to recombination, genealogical history of a set of DNA sequences in a population usually cannot be represented by a single tree. Instead, genealogy is better represented by a genealogical network, which is a compact representation of a set of correlated local genealogical trees, each for a short region of genome and possibly with different topology. Inference of genealogical history for a set of DNA sequences under recombination has many potential applications, including association mapping of complex diseases.In this paper, we present two new methods for reconstructing local tree topologies with the presence of recombination, which extend and improve the previous work in. We first show that the \"tree scanâ\u20AC? method can be converted to a probabilistic inference method based on a hidden Markov model. We then focus on developing a novel local tree inference method called RENT that is both accurate and scalable to larger data. Through simulation, we demonstrate the usefulness of our methods by showing that the hidden-Markov-model-based method is comparable with the original method interms of accuracy. We also show that RENT is competitive with other methods in terms of inference accuracy, and its inference error rate is often lower and can handle large data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4552","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
