We consider the problem of controlling motion in a distributed manner for a mobile sensor network for a specific form of motion capability. Mobility itself may have a high resource overhead, hence we exploit motility, a constrained form of mobility, which has very low overheads but provides significant reconfiguration potential. We present an architecture that allows each node in the network to learn the medium and phenomenon characteristics. We describe a quantitative metric for sensing performance that is concretely tied to real sensor and medium characteristics, rather than assuming an abstract range based model. The problem of determining the desirable network configuration is expressed as an optimization of this metric. We present a distributed optimization algorithm which computes a desirable network configuration, and adapts it to environmental changes. The relationship of the proposed algorithm to simulated annealing and incremental subgradient descent based methods is discussed. A key property of our algorithm is that convergence to a desirable configuration can be proved even though no global coordination is involved. A network protocol to implement this algorithm is discussed, followed by simulations and experiments on a laboratory test bed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21226","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21226","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3023","fieldValue":" In this article we present a technique for mining transliteration pairs using a set of simple features derived from a many-to-many bilingual forced-alignment at the grapheme level to classify candidate transliteration word pairs as correct transliterations or not. We use a nonparametric Bayesian method for the alignment process, as this process rewards the reuse of parameters, resulting in compact models that align in a consistent manner and tend not to over-fit. Our approach uses the generative model resulting from aligning the training data to force-align the test data. We rely on the simple assumption that correct transliteration pairs would be well modeled and generated easily, whereas incorrect pairs---being more random in character---would be more costly to model and generate. Our generative model generates by concatenating bilingual grapheme sequence pairs. The many-to-many generation process is essential for handling many languages with non-Roman scripts, and it is hard to train well using a maximum likelihood techniques, as these tend to over-fit the data. Our approach works on the principle that generation using only grapheme sequence pairs that are in the model results in a high probability derivation, whereas if the model is forced to introduce a new parameter in order to explain part of the candidate pair, the derivation probability is substantially reduced and severely reduced if the new parameter corresponds to a sequence pair composed of a large number of graphemes. The features we extract from the alignment of the test data are not only based on the scores from the generative model, but also on the relative proportions of each sequence that are hard to generate. The features are used in conjunction with a support vector machine classifier trained on known positive examples together with synthetic negative examples to determine whether a candidate word pair is a correct transliteration pair. In our experiments, we used all data tracks from the 2010 Named-Entity Workshop (NEWSâ\u20AC™10) and use the performance of the best system for each language pair as a reference point. Our results show that the new features we propose are powerfully predictive, enabling our approach to achieve levels of performance on this task that are comparable to the state of the art."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3023","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3023","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21227","fieldValue":" Broadcast authentication is a critical security service in wireless sensor networks. There are two general approaches for broadcast authentication in wireless sensor networks: digital signatures and Î¼TESLA-based techniques. However, both signature-based and Î¼TESLA-based broadcast authentication are vulnerable to Denial of Services (DoS) attacks: An attacker can inject bogus broadcast packets to force sensor nodes to perform expensive signature verifications (in case of signature-based broadcast authentication) or packet forwarding (in case of Î¼TESLA-based broadcast authentication), thus exhausting their limited battery power. This paper presents an efficient mechanism called message-specific puzzle to mitigate such DoS attacks. In addition to signature-based or Î¼TESLA-based broadcast authentication, this approach adds a weak authenticator in each broadcast packet, which can be efficiently verified by a regular sensor node, but takes a computationally powerful attacker a substantial amount of time to forge. Upon receiving a broadcast packet, each sensor node first verifies the weak authenticator, and performs the expensive signature verification (in signature-based broadcast authentication) or packet forwarding (in Î¼TESLA-based broadcast authentication) only when the weak authenticator is valid. A weak authenticator cannot be precomputed without a non-reusable (or short-lived) key disclosed only in a valid packet. Even if an attacker has intensive computational resources to forge one or more weak authenticators, it is difficult to reuse these forged weak authenticators. Thus, this weak authentication mechanism substantially increases the difficulty of launching successful DoS attacks against signature-based or Î¼TESLA-based broadcast authentication. A limitation of this approach is that it requires a powerful sender and introduces sender-side delay. This article also reports an implementation of the proposed techniques on TinyOS, as well as initial experimental evaluation in a network of MICAz motes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21227","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21227","fieldValue":"ACM"}
