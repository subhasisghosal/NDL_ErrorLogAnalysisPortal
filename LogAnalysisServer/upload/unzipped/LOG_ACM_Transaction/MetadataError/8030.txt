In this paper, we study the scenario where sensors take measurements of one or more dynamic targets and send state estimates of the targets to a fusion center via satellite links. The severe loss and delay inherent over the satellite channels reduce the number of estimates successfully arriving at the fusion center, thereby limiting the potential fusion gain and resulting in suboptimal accuracy performance of the fused estimates. In addition, the errors in target-sensor data association can also degrade the estimation performance. To mitigate the effect of imperfect communications on state estimation and fusion, we consider retransmission and retrodiction. The system adopts certain retransmission-based transport protocols so that lost messages can be recovered over time. Moreover, retrodiction\/smoothing techniques are applied so that the chances of incurring excess delay due to retransmission are greatly reduced. We analyze the extent to which retransmission and retrodiction can improve the performance of delay-sensitive target tracking tasks under variable communication loss and delay conditions. Simulation results of a ballistic target tracking application are shown in the end to demonstrate the validity of our analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10880","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10880","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10880","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10881","fieldValue":" Internet service providers should deploy effective active queue management (AQM) strategies to provide high-bandwidth low-latency access links to customers. However, they do not, and customers see high latencies, which are problematic for latency-sensitive applications (e.g., VoIP). As a result, customers have to deploy token buckets, but they are hard to configure. In this paper, we evaluate different token bucket configurations and find that the anecdotal evidence regarding token bucket configuration is not optimal. We analyze different configurations using the ns-2 simulator and find a formula to derive optimal parameters depending on the link bandwidth, which brings about much lower latency and higher throughput."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10881","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10881","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10881","fieldValue":"ACM"}
