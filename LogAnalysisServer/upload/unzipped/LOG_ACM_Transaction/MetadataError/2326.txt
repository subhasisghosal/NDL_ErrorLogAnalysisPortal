When an object is viewed from a distance, the highest level of detail offered by these models is usually unnecessary, but traditional linear downsampling weakens the object's intrinsic shadowing structures and can yield poor accuracy. We introduce a joint optimization of single-scattering albedos and phase functions to accurately downsample heterogeneous and anisotropic media. Our method is built upon scaled phase functions, a new representation combining abledos and (standard) phase functions. We also show that modularity can be exploited to greatly reduce the amortized optimization overhead by allowing multiple synthesized models to share one set of down-sampled parameters. Our optimized parameters generalize well to novel lighting and viewing configurations, and the resulting data sets offer several orders of magnitude storage savings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17663","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17663","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17664","fieldValue":" Several scalable many-light rendering methods have been proposed recently for the efficient computation of global illumination. However, gathering contributions of virtual lights in participating media remains an inefficient and time-consuming task. In this paper, we present a novel sparse sampling and reconstruction method to accelerate the gathering step of the many-light rendering for participating media. Our technique explores the observation that the scattered lightings are usually locally coherent and of low rank even in heterogeneous media. In particular, we first introduce a matrix formation with light segments as columns and eye ray segments as rows, and formulate the gathering step into a matrix sampling and reconstruction problem. We then propose an adaptive matrix column sampling and completion algorithm to efficiently reconstruct the matrix by only sampling a small number of elements. Experimental results show that our approach greatly improves the performance, and obtains up to one order of magnitude speedup compared with other state-of-the-art methods of many-light rendering for participating media."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17664","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17664","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17665","fieldValue":" We address the challenge of efficiently rendering massive assemblies of grains within a forward path-tracing framework. Previous approaches exist for accelerating high-order scattering for a limited, and static, set of granular materials, often requiring scene-dependent precomputation. We significantly expand the admissible regime of granular materials by considering heterogeneous and dynamic granular mixtures with spatially varying grain concentrations, pack rates, and sizes. Our method supports both procedurally generated grain assemblies and dynamic assemblies authored in off-the-shelf particle simulation tools. The key to our speedup lies in two complementary aggregate scattering approximations which we introduced to jointly accelerate construction of short and long light paths. For low-order scattering, we accelerate path construction using novel grain scattering distribution functions (GSDF) which aggregate intra-grain light transport while retaining important grain-level structure. For high-order scattering, we extend prior work on shell transport functions (STF) to support dynamic, heterogeneous mixtures of grains with varying sizes. We do this without a scene-dependent precomputation and show how this can also be used to accelerate light transport in arbitrary continuous heterogeneous media. Our multi-scale rendering automatically minimizes the usage of explicit path tracing to only the first grain along a light path, or can avoid it completely, when appropriate, by switching to our aggregate transport approximations. We demonstrate our technique on animated scenes containing heterogeneous mixtures of various types of grains that could not previously be rendered efficiently. We also compare to previous work on a simpler class of granular assemblies, reporting significant computation savings, often yielding higher accuracy results."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17665","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Disney Research and ETH Z&#252;rich (Mller, Thomas; Gross, Markus); Dartmouth College (Jarosz, Wojciech); Disney Research (Papas, Marios; Novk, Jan)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17665","fieldValue":"ACM"}
