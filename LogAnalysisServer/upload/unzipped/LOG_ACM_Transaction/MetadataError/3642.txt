Using an FPGA as the implementation platform introduces greater flexibility into the design process and allows a new approach to embedded system design. Since there is no cost to reprogramming an FPGA, system performance can be measured on-chip in the runtime environment and the system's architecture can be altered based on an evaluation of the data to meet design requirements. In this article, we discuss a new hardware\/software codesign methodology tailored to reconfigurable platforms and a design infrastructure created to incorporate on-chip design tools. This methodology utilizes the FPGA's reconfigurability during the design process to profile and verify system performance, thereby reducing system design time. Our current design infrastructure includes: a system specification tool, two on-chip profiling tools, and an on-chip system verification tool."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21790","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21790","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21791","fieldValue":" Mobile robots are widely used in industrial environments and are expected to be widely available in human environments in the near future, for example, in the area of care and service robots. This article proposes an implementation for a highly customizable color recognition module based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware to accomplish tasks like real-time frame processing for image streams. In comparison to a pure software solution on a CPU, an attached FPGA-based hardware accelerator enables real-time image processing and significantly reduces the required computing power of the CPU. Instead, the CPU can be used for tasks that cannot be efficiently implemented on FPGAs, for example, because of a large control overhead. We concentrate on a multirobot scenario where a group of robots follows a human team member by keeping a specific formation in order to support the human in exploration and object detection. Additionally, the robots provide a communication infrastructure to maintain a stable multihop communication network between the human and a base station recording all actions and evaluating the captured images and transmitted data. Depending on the current operating conditions, the robot system has to be able to execute a wide variety of different tasks. Since only a small number of tasks have to be executed concurrently, dynamic reconfiguration of the FPGA can be used to avoid the parallel implementation of all tasks on the FPGA. Within this context, this article discusses application fields where dynamic reconfiguration of FPGA-based coprocessors significantly reduces the CPU load and presents examples of how dynamic reconfiguration can be used in exploration."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21791","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21791","fieldValue":"Applying dynamic reconfiguration in the mobile robotics domain: A case study on computer vision algorithms"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21791","fieldValue":"ACM"}
