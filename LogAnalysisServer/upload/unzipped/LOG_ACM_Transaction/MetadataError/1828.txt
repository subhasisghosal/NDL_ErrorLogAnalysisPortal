The final image often has relatively smooth shadow patterns, since it integrates over the light source. However, Monte Carlo rendering exhibits considerable noise even at high sample counts because of the large variance of the integrand due to the intricate shadow function. This article develops an efficient diffuse soft shadow technique for mid to far occluders that relies on a new 4D cache and sheared reconstruction filter. For this, we first derive a frequency analysis of shadows for planar area lights and complex occluders. Our analysis subsumes convolution soft shadows for parallel planes as a special case. It allows us to derive 4D sheared filters that enable lower sampling rates for soft shadows. While previous sheared-reconstruction techniques were able primarily to index samples according to screen position, we need to perform reconstruction at surface receiver points that integrate over vastly different shapes in the reconstruction domain. This is why we develop a new light-field-like 4D data structure to store shadowing values and depth information. Any ray tracing system that shoots shadow rays can easily incorporate our method to greatly reduce sampling rates for diffuse soft shadows."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16408","fieldValue":"Zhang, Ren-Jiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16408","fieldValue":" An efficient scheme is introduced to construct interpolatory curves and surfaces passing through a set of given scattered data points. The scheme is based on an interpolatory basis derived from the sinc function with a Guassian multiplier previously applied in other fields for signal or function reconstruction. In connection with its application addressed in this article for spatial curve and surface construction, the interpolatory basis possesses various nice properties, such as partition of unity, linear precision, and local support, etc., under a small tolerance. By using these basis functions, free-form curves and surfaces can be conveniently constructed. A designer can adjust the shape of the constructed curve and surface by moving some interpolating points or by inserting new interpolating points. The resulting interpolatory curves and surfaces are $C^&infty;$ continuous. Smooth connection between curves or surfaces can easily be achieved. Closed curves and surfaces can also be expressed using the proposed interpolatory basis functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16408","fieldValue":"An efficient scheme for curve and surface construction based on a set of interpolatory basis functions"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16408","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16408","fieldValue":"ACM"}
