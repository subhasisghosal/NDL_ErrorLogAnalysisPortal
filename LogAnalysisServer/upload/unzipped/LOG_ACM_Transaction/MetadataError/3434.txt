The situation becomes worse if energy-efficient jamming can be achieved by exploiting knowledge of the data link layer. Encrypting the packets may help to prevent the jammer from taking actions based on the content of the packets, but the temporal arrangement of the packets induced by the nature of the protocol might unravel patterns that the jammer can take advantage of, even when the packets are encrypted. By looking at the packet interarrival times in three representative MAC protocols, S-MAC, LMAC, and B-MAC, we derive several jamming attacks that allow the jammer to jam S-MAC, LMAC, and B-MAC energy efficiently. The jamming attacks are based on realistic assumptions. The algorithms are described in detail and simulated. The effectiveness and efficiency of the attacks are examined. In addition, we validate our simulation model by comparing its results with measurements obtained from actual implementation on our sensor node prototypes. We show that it takes little effort to implement such effective jammers, making them a realistic threat. Careful analysis of other protocols belonging to the respective categories of S-MAC, LMAC, and B-MAC reveals that those protocols are, to some extent, also susceptible to our attacks. The result of this investigation provides new insights into the security considerations of MAC protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21258","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21259","fieldValue":" Location information is useful both for network organization and for sensor data integrity. In this article, we study the anchor-free 2D localization problem by using local angle measurements. We prove that given a unit disk graph and the angles between adjacent edges, it is NP-hard to find a valid embedding in the plane such that neighboring nodes are within distance 1 from each other and non-neighboring nodes are at least distance &sqrt;2\/2 away. Despite the negative results, however, we can find a planar spanner of a unit disk graph by using only local angles. The planar spanner can be used to generate a set of virtual coordinates that enable efficient and local routing schemes such as geographical routing or approximate shortest path routing. We also proposed a practical anchor-free embedding scheme by solving a linear program. We show by simulation that it gives both a good local embedding, with neighboring nodes embedded close and non-neighboring nodes far away, and a satisfactory global view such that geographical routing and approximate shortest path routing on the embedded graph are almost identical to those on the original (true) embedding."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21260","fieldValue":" One of the useful approaches to exploit redundancy in a sensor network is to keep active only a small subset of sensors that are sufficient to cover the region required to be monitored. The set of active sensors should also form a connected communication graph, so that they can autonomously respond to application queries and\/or tasks. Such a set of active sensors is known as a connected sensor cover, and the problem of selecting a minimum connected sensor cover has been well studied when the transmission radius and sensing radius of each sensor is fixed. In this article, we address the problem of selecting a minimum energy-cost connected sensor cover, when each sensor node can vary its sensing and transmission radius; larger sensing or transmission radius entails higher energy cost. For the aforesaid problem, we design various centralized and distributed algorithms, and compare their performance through extensive experiments. One of the designed centralized algorithms (called CGA) is shown to perform within an O(log n) factor of the optimal solution, where n is the size of the network. We have also designed a localized algorithm based on Voronoi diagrams which is empirically shown to perform very close to CGA and, due to its communication-efficiency, results in significantly prolonging the network lifetime. We also extend the aforementioned algorithms to incorporate fault tolerance. In particular, we show how to extend the algorithms to address the minimum energy-cost connected sensor k-cover problem, in which every point in the query region needs to be covered by at least k distinct active sensors. The CGA preserves the approximation bound in this case. We also propose a localized topology control scheme to preserve k-connectivity, and use it to extend the Voronoi-based approach to computing a minimum energy-cost $k_1-connected k2$-cover. We study the performance of our proposed algorithms through extensive simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21260","fieldValue":"ACM"}
