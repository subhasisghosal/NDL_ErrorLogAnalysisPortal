These approaches provide promising results in terms of recognition performance, coping with the uncertainty of observations, and model size explosion when complex problems are modelled. But experience has shown that it is not always intuitive to model even seemingly simple problems. To date, there are no guidelines for developing such models. To address this problem, in this work we present a development process for building symbolic models that is based on experience acquired so far as well as on existing engineering and data analysis workflows. The proposed process is a first attempt at providing structured guidelines and practices for designing, modelling, and evaluating human behaviour in the form of symbolic models for AR. As an illustration of the process, a simple example from the office domain was developed. The process was evaluated in a comparative study of an intuitive process and the proposed process. The results showed a significant improvement over the intuitive process. Furthermore, the study participants reported greater ease of use and perceived effectiveness when following the proposed process. To evaluate the applicability of the process to more complex AR problems, it was applied to a problem from the kitchen domain. The results showed that following the proposed process yielded an average accuracy of 78&percnt;. The developed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods applied to the same dataset in previous work, and it performed comparably to a symbolic model developed by a model expert without following the proposed development process."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7233","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1660","fieldValue":" The performance of memory hierarchies, in which caches play an essential role, is critical in nowadays general-purpose and embedded computing systems because of the growing memory bottleneck problem. Unfortunately, cache behavior is very unstable and difficult to predict. This is particularly true in the presence of irregular access patterns, which exhibit little locality. Such patterns are very common, for example, in applications in which pointers or compressed sparse matrices give place to indirections. Nevertheless, cache behavior in the presence of irregular access patterns has not been widely studied. In this paper we present an extension of a systematic analytical modeling technique based on PMEs (probabilistic miss equations), previously developed by the authors, that allows the automated analysis of the cache behavior for codes with irregular access patterns resulting from indirections. The model generates very accurate predictions despite the irregularities and has very low computing requirements, being the first model that gathers these desirable characteristics that can automatically analyze this kind of codes. These properties enable this model to help drive compiler optimizations, as we show with an example."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1660","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1660","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7234","fieldValue":" In this article, we discuss our findings from an ethnographic study at an elderly care center where we observed the utilization of two different functions of human gaze to convey service order (i.e., â\u20ACœwho is served first and who is served nextâ\u20AC?). In one case, when an elderly person requested assistance, the gaze of the care worker communicated that he\/she would serve that client next in turn. In the other case, the gaze conveyed a request to the service seeker to wait until the care worker finished attending the current client. Each gaze function depended on the care worker's current engagement and other behaviors. We sought to integrate these findings into the development of a robot that might function more effectively in multiple human-robot party settings. We focused on the multiple functions of gaze and bodily actions, implementing those functions into our robot. We conducted three experiments to gauge a combination of gestures and gazes performed by our robot. This article demonstrates that the employment of gaze is an important consideration when developing robots that can interact effectively in multiple human-robot party settings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7234","fieldValue":"ACM"}
