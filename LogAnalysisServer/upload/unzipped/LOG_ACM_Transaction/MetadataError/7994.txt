Particularly, each node in an uplink cellular network injects two types of traffic, confidential and open at rates chosen in order to maximize a global utility function while keeping the data queues stable and meeting a constraint on the secrecy outage probability. The transmitting node only knows the distribution of channel gains. Our scheme is based on Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) transmission with incremental redundancy. We prove that our scheme achieves a utility, arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the analytical results and to show the efficacy of the dynamic control algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10805","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10805","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10805","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10806","fieldValue":" Thanks to the convergence of pervasive mobile communications and fast-growing online social networking, mobile social networking is penetrating into our everyday life. Aiming to develop a systematic understanding of mobile social networks, in this paper we exploit social ties in human social networks to enhance cooperative device-to-device (D2D) communications. Specifically, as handheld devices are carried by human beings, we leverage two key social phenomena, namely social trust and social reciprocity, to promote efficient cooperation among devices. With this insight, we develop a coalitional game-theoretic framework to devise social-tie-based cooperation strategies for D2D communications. We also develop a network-assisted relay selection mechanism to implement the coalitional game solution, and show that the mechanism is immune to group deviations, individually rational, truthful, and computationally efficient. We evaluate the performance of the mechanism by using real social data traces. Simulation results corroborate that the proposed mechanism can achieve significant performance gain over the case without D2D cooperation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10806","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10806","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10807","fieldValue":" We investigate the achievable performance gain that network coding (NC) when combined with successive interference cancellation (SIC) brings to a multihop wireless network. While SIC enables concurrent receptions from multiple transmitters, NC reduces the transmission time-slot overhead, and each of these techniques has shown independently great benefits in improving the network performance. We present a cross-layer formulation for the joint routing and scheduling problem in a wireless network with NC (with opportunistic listening) and SIC capabilities. We use the realistic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) interference model. To solve this combinatorially complex nonlinear problem, we decompose it (using column generation) to two linear subproblems--namely opportunistic NC aware routing and scheduling subproblems. Our scheduling subproblem consists of activating noninterfering NC components, rather than links, which do not interfere with each other and will be used to route the traffic. We further extend our design to consider a multi-rate multihop wireless network with interference cancellation capabilities. We use numerical evaluation to present the achieved performance gain and compare our work to three other models: a base model with no NC and SIC, a model with only NC, and a model with only SIC capabilities. The numerical results show that our proposed method (both with and without variable transmission rate selection) achieves performance gains that range between moderate and significant for the various considered scenarios. Such improvements are attributed to the joint capabilities of SIC and NC in effectively controlling the interference and improving the spatial reuse."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10807","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
