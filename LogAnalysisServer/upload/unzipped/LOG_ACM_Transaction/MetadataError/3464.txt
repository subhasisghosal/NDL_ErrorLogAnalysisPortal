Based on measurements from three or more sensors, a geometric difference triangulation method or an N-sensor localization method is used to estimate the location and strength of the source. Then a sequential probability ratio test based on current measurements and estimated parameters is employed to finally decide: (1) the presence of a source with the estimated parameters, or (2) the absence of the source, or (3) the insufficiency of measurements to make a decision. This method achieves specified levels of false alarm and missed detection probabilities, while ensuring a close-to-minimal number of measurements for reaching a decision. This method minimizes the ghost-source problem of current estimation methods, and achieves a lower false alarm rate compared with current detection methods. This method is tested and demonstrated using: (1) simulations, and (2) a test-bed that utilizes the scaling properties of point radioactive sources to emulate high intensity ones that cannot be easily and safely handled in laboratory experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21337","fieldValue":" Distributed active sensing is a new sensing paradigm, where active sensors (aka actuators) as illuminating sources and passive sensors as receivers are distributed in a field, and collaboratively detect events of interest. In this paper, we study the fundamental properties of distributed actuator and sensor networks (DASNs) in detecting and localizing obstacles. A novel notion of â\u20ACœexposureâ\u20AC? is defined, which quantifies the dimension limitations in detectability. Using simple geometric constructs, we propose polynomial-time algorithms to compute the exposure and bounding regions where the center of the obstacles may lie."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21338","fieldValue":" The exposure of a path p in a sensor field is a measure of the likelihood that an object traveling along p is detected by at least one sensor from a network of sensors, and is formally defined as an integral over all points x of p of the sensibility (the strength of the signal coming from x) times the element of path length. The minimum exposure path (MEP) problem is, given a pair of points x and y inside a sensor field, to find a path between x and y of minimum exposure. In this article we introduce the first rigorous treatment of the problem, designing an approximation algorithm for the MEP problem with guaranteed performance characteristics. Given a convex polygon P of size n with O(n) sensors inside it and any real number &epsis;>0, our algorithm finds a path in P whose exposure is within an 1+&epsis; factor of the exposure of the MEP, in time $O(n\/&epsis;^2$ Ïˆlog n), where Ïˆ is a geometric characteristic of the field. We also describe a framework for a faster implementation of our algorithm, which reduces the time by a factor of approximately Î¸(1\/&epsis;), while keeping the same approximation ratio."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21338","fieldValue":"ACM"}
