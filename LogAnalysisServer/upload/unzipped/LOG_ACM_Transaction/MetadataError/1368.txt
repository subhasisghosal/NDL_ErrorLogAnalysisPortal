Using a simple scripting language, we define the internal structure of a volume from one or more input meshes. Sculpting and simulation operators are applied within the context of the language to shape and modify the model. Our framework treats simulation as a modeling operator rather than simply as a tool for animation, thereby suggesting a new paradigm for modeling as well as a new level of abstraction for interacting with simulation environments.Capturing real-world effects with standard modeling techniques is extremely challenging. Our key contribution is a concise procedural approach for seamlessly building and modifying complex solid geometry. We present an implementation of our language using a flexible tetrahedral representation. We show a variety of complex objects modeled in our system using tools that interface with finite element method and particle system simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15222","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15222","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2442","fieldValue":" We describe a simple algorithm for approximating the empirical entropy of a stream of m values up to a multiplicative factor of (1+&epsi;) using a single pass, $O(&epsi;^âˆ\u20192 log (Î\u201Dâˆ\u20191) log m) words of space, and O(log &epsi;âˆ\u20191 + log log Î\u201Dâˆ\u20191 + log log m) processing time per item in the stream. Our algorithm is based upon a novel extension of a method introduced by Alon et al. [1999]. This improves over previous work on this problem. We show a space lower bound of Î©(&epsi;âˆ\u20192\/log2 (&epsi;âˆ\u20191$)), demonstrating that our algorithm is near-optimal in terms of its dependency on &epsi;. We show that generalizing to multiplicative-approximation of the kth-order entropy requires close to linear space for kâ\u2030¥1. In contrast we show that additive-approximation is possible in a single pass using only poly-logarithmic space. Lastly, we show how to compute a multiplicative approximation to the entropy of a random walk on an undirected graph."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15223","fieldValue":" Cutting and pasting to combine different elements into a common structure are widely used operations that have been successfully adapted to many media types. Surface design could also benefit from the availability of a general, robust, and efficient cut-and-paste tool, especially during the initial stages of design when a large space of alternatives needs to be explored. Techniques to support cut-and-paste operations for surfaces have been proposed in the past, but have been of limited usefulness due to constraints on the type of shapes supported and the lack of real-time interaction. In this paper, we describe a set of algorithms based on multiresolution subdivision surfaces that perform at interactive rates and enable intuitive cut-and-paste operations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15223","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15223","fieldValue":"ACM"}
