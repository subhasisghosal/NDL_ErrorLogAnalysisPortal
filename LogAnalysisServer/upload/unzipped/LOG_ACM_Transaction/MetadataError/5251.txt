However, the large number of features compared to the number of samples makes the task of feature selection computationally hard and prone to errors. This paper interprets feature selection as a task of stochastic optimization, where the goal is to select among an exponential number of alternative gene subsets the one expected to return the highest generalization in classification. Blocking is an experimental design strategy which produces similar experimental conditions to compare alternative stochastic configurations in order to be confident that observed differences in accuracy are due to actual differences rather than to fluctuations and noise effects. We propose an original blocking strategy for improving feature selection which aggregates in a paired way the validation outcomes of several learning algorithms to assess a gene subset and compare it to others. This is a novelty with respect to conventional wrappers, which commonly adopt a sole learning algorithm to evaluate the relevance of a given set of variables. The rationale of the approach is that, by increasing the amount of experimental conditions under which we validate a feature subset, we can lessen the problems related to the scarcity of samples and consequently come up with a better selection. The paper shows that the blocking strategy significantly improves the performance of a conventional forward selection for a set of 16 publicly available cancer expression data sets. The experiments involve six different classifiers and show that improvements take place independent of the classification algorithm used after the selection step. Two further validations based on available biological annotation support the claim that blocking strategies in feature selection may improve the accuracy and the quality of the solution. The first validation is based on retrieving PubMEd abstracts associated to the selected genes and matching them to regular expressions describing the biological phenomenon underlying the expression data sets. The biological validation that follows is based on the use of the Bioconductor package GoStats in order to perform Gene Ontology statistical analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4294","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4294","fieldValue":"Bioinformatics (genome or protein) databases, data mining, machine learning, feature evaluation and selection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4294","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4294","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4295","fieldValue":"Sagot, Marie-France"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4295","fieldValue":" In comparative genomics, gene order data is often modeled as signed permutations. A classical problem for genome comparison is to detect common intervals in permutations, that is, genes that are colocalized in several species, indicating that they remained grouped during evolution. A second largely studied problem related to gene order is to compute a minimum scenario of reversals that transforms a signed permutation into another. Several studies began to mix the two problems and it was observed that their results are not always compatible: Often, parsimonious scenarios of reversals break common intervals. If a scenario does not break any common interval, it is called perfect. In two recent studies, BÃ©rard et al. defined a class of permutations for which building a perfect scenario of reversals sorting a permutation was achieved in polynomial time and stated as an open question whether it is possible to decide, given a permutation, if there exists a minimum scenario of reversals that is perfect. In this paper, we give a solution to this problem and prove that this widens the class of permutations addressed by the aforementioned studies. We implemented and tested this algorithm on gene order data of chromosomes from several mammal species and we compared it to other methods. The algorithm helps to choose among several possible scenarios of reversals and indicates that the minimum scenario of reversals is not always the most plausible."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4295","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
