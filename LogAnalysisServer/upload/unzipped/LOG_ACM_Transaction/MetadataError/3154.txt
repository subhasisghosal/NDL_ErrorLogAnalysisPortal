In this article, the focus is on visual HCI, where the messages exchanged between human and computer are images appearing on the computer screen, as usual in current popular user interfaces. We formalize interactive sessions of a human-computer dialogue as a structured set of legal visual sentences, i.e., as a visual language, and show how rewriting systems can be generalized to specify both the pictorial and the computational aspects of visual languages. To this end, Visual Conditional Attributed Rewriting (VCARW) systems are introduced, and use for specification of visual languages. These specifications are given as inputs to a procedure illustrated in the article as a system of algorithms, which automatically generates control mechanisms of the interaction, thus favoring the design of more reliable and usable systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20422","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20422","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2953","fieldValue":"Nguyen, Cam-Tu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2953","fieldValue":"Phan, Xuan-Hieu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2953","fieldValue":"Nguyen, Thu-Trang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2953","fieldValue":"Ha, Quang-Thuy"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2953","fieldValue":" Web search clustering is a solution to reorganize search results (also called â\u20ACœsnippetsâ\u20AC?) in a more convenient way for browsing. There are three key requirements for such post-retrieval clustering systems: (1) the clustering algorithm should group similar documents together; (2) clusters should be labeled with descriptive phrases; and (3) the clustering system should provide high-quality clustering without downloading the whole Web page. This article introduces a novel framework for clustering Web search results in Vietnamese which targets the three above issues. The main motivation is that by enriching short snippets with hidden topics from huge resources of documents on the Internet, it is able to cluster and label such snippets effectively in a topic-oriented manner without concerning whole Web pages. Our approach is based on recent successful topic analysis models, such as Probabilistic-Latent Semantic Analysis, or Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The underlying idea of the framework is that we collect a very large external data collection called â\u20ACœuniversal dataset,â\u20AC? and then build a clustering system on both the original snippets and a rich set of hidden topics discovered from the universal data collection. This can be seen as a richer representation of snippets to be clustered. We carry out careful evaluation of our method and show that our method can yield impressive clustering quality."}
