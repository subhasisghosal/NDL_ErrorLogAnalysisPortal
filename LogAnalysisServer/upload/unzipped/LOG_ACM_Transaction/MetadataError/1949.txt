Given the hair color, eye color, and skin color of the input body, plus a wardrobe of clothing items, our outfit synthesis system suggests a set of outfits subject to a particular dress code. We introduce a probabilistic framework for modeling and applying dress codes that exploits a Bayesian network trained on example images of real-world outfits. Suitable outfits are then obtained by optimizing a cost function that guides the selection of clothing items to maximize the color compatibility and dress code suitability. We demonstrate our approach on the four most common dress codes: Casual, Sportswear, Business-Casual, and Business. A perceptual study validated on multiple resultant outfits demonstrates the efficacy of our framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16723","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16723","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1183","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1183","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2585","fieldValue":" A well-studied special case of bin packing is the 3-partition problem, where n items of size > 1\/4 have to be packed in a minimum number of bins of capacity one. The famous Karmarkar-Karp algorithm transforms a fractional solution of a suitable LP relaxation for this problem into an integral solution that requires at most O(log n) additional bins. The three-permutations-problem of Beck is the following. Given any three permutations on n symbols, color the symbols red and blue, such that in any interval of any of those permutations, the number of red and blue symbols is roughly the same. The necessary difference is called the discrepancy. We establish a surprising connection between bin packing and Beckâ\u20AC™s problem: The additive integrality gap of the 3-partition linear programming relaxation can be bounded by the discrepancy of three permutations. This connection yields an alternative method to establish an O(log n) bound on the additive integrality gap of the 3-partition. Conversely, making use of a recent example of three permutations, for which a discrepancy of Î©(log n) is necessary, we prove the following: The $O(log^2$ n) upper bound on the additive gap for bin packing with arbitrary item sizes cannot be improved by any technique that is based on rounding up items. This lower bound holds for a large class of algorithms including the Karmarkar-Karp procedure."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2585","fieldValue":"ACM"}
