This undesired heterogeneity threatens execution predictability and energy efficiency. We propose two techniques to allocate sets of barrier-synchronized tasks. The first technique models allocation as an ILP and achieves optimal results, but requires an offline solver. The second technique adopts a two-stage heuristic approach, and it can be adapted to work online. We tested our approach on the virtual prototype of a next-generation industrial multicore platform. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach minimizes deadline violations while increasing energy efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6578","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6578","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6579","fieldValue":" JPEG XR is an emerging image coding standard, based on HD Photo developed by Microsoft Corporation. It supports high compression performance twice as high as the de facto image coding system, namely, JPEG, and also has an advantage over JPEG 2000 in terms of computational cost. JPEG XR is expected to be widespread for many devices including embedded systems in the near future. In this article, we propose a novel architecture for JPEG XR encoding. In previous architectures, entropy coding was the throughput bottleneck because it was implemented as a sequential algorithm to handle data with dependency. We found that there is no dependency in intra-macroblock data, and we could safely pipeline all the encoding processes including the entropy coding. In addition, each module of our architecture, which can be regarded as a pipeline stage, can be parallelized. As a result, our architecture can achieve 12.8 pixel\/cycle at its maximum. To demonstrate our architecture, we designed three versions of our architecture with different degrees of parallelism of one, two, and four. Our four-way parallel architecture achieves 579 Mpixel\/sec at 181MHz clock frequency for grayscale images."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6579","fieldValue":"JPEG XR"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6580","fieldValue":"Stehr, Mark-Oliver"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6580","fieldValue":" Resource-limited mobile embedded systems can benefit greatly from dynamic adaptation of system parameters. We propose a novel approach that employs iterative tuning using lightweight formal verification at runtime with feedback for dynamic adaptation. One objective of this approach is to enable trade-off analysis across multiple layers (e.g., application, middleware, OS) and predict the possible property violations as the system evolves dynamically over time. Specifically, an executable formal specification is developed for each layer of the mobile system under consideration. The formal specification is then analyzed using statistical property checking and statistical quantitative analysis, to determine the impact of various resource management policies for achieving desired timing\/QoS properties. Integration of formal analysis with dynamic behavior from system execution results in a feedback loop that enables model refinement and further optimization of policies and parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to the adaptive provisioning of resource-limited distributed real-time systems using a mobile multimedia case study."}
