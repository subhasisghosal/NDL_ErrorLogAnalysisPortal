Session traffic is routed at each hop (potentially through multiple network paths) based only on its destination. Each session is associated with a concave increasing utility function of its transfer rate. The transfer rates of all sessions and the routing policy define the operating point of the network.We construct a metric f of the goodness of this operating point. f is an increasing function of the session utilities and a decreasing function of the extent of congestion in the network.We define\"good\" operating points as those that maximizef, subject to the capacity constraints in the network. This paper presents a distributed, iterative algorithm for adapting the session rates and the routing policy across the network so as to converge asymptotically to the set of \"good\" operating points. The algorithm updates session rates and routing variables concurrently and is, therefore, amenable to distributed online implementation. The convergence of the concurrent update scheme is proved rigorously."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9909","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9909","fieldValue":"Distributed iterative optimal resource allocation with concurrent updates of routing and flow control variables"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9909","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9909","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9910","fieldValue":" This paper addresses a parameter estimation problem of Markovian arrival process (MAP). In network traffic measurement experiments, one often encounters the group data where arrival times for a group are collected as one bin. Although the group data are observed in many situations, nearly all existing estimation methods for MAP are based on nongroup data. This paper proposes a numerical procedure for fitting a MAP and a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP) to group data. The proposed algorithm is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) approach and is a natural but significant extension of the existing EM algorithms to estimate parameters of the MAP and MMPP. Specifically for the MMPP estimation, we provide an efficient approximation based on the proposed EM algorithm. We examine the performance of proposed algorithms via numerical experiments and present an example of traffic analysis with real traffic data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9910","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9910","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9910","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1899","fieldValue":" Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs) present a potential of high compute throughput with energy efficiency. A CGRA consists of an array of Functional Units (FUs), which communicate with each other through an interconnect network containing transmission nodes and register files. To achieve high performance from the software solutions mapped onto CGRAs, modulo scheduling of loops is generally employed. One of the key challenges in modulo scheduling for CGRAs is to explicitly handle routings of operands from a source to a destination operations through various routing resources. Existing modulo schedulers for CGRAs are slow because finding a valid routing is generally a searching problem over a large space, even with the guidance of well-defined cost metrics. Applications in traditional embedded multimedia domains are regarded as relatively tolerant to a slow compile time in exchange for a high-quality solution. However, many rapidly growing domains of applications, such as 3D graphics, require a fast compilation. Entrances of CGRAs to these domains have been blocked mainly due to their long compile time. We attack this problem by utilizing patternized routes, for which resources and time slots for a success can be estimated in advance when a source operation is placed. By conservatively reserving predefined resources at predefined time slots, future routings originating from the source operation are guaranteed. Experiments on a real-world 3D graphics benchmark suite show that our scheduler improves the compile time up to 6,000 times while achieving an average 70&percnt; throughputs of the state-of-the-art CGRA modulo scheduler, the Edge-centric Modulo Scheduler (EMS)."}
