They showed its satisfiability problem to be in 3-DEXPTIME. We improve this result by showing that satisfiability for this class is NEXPTIME-complete, using new resolution techniques. We show satisfiability to be DEXPTIME-complete if clauses are Horn, which is what is required for modeling cryptographic protocols. While translation to Horn clauses only gives a DEXPTIME upper bound for the secrecy problem for these protocols, we further show that this secrecy problem is actually DEXPTIME-complete."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11532","fieldValue":"Flat and one-variable clauses: Complexity of verifying cryptographic protocols with single blind copying"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1139","fieldValue":" Forming groups of agents is an important task in many agent-based applications, for example when determining a coalition of buyers in an e-commerce community or organizing different Web services in a Web services' composition. A key issue in this context is that of generating groups of agents such that the communication among agents of the same group is not subjected to comprehension problems. To this purpose, several approaches have been proposed in the past in order to form groups of agents based on some similarity measures among agents. Such similarity measures are mainly based on lexical and\/or structural similarities among agent ontologies. However, the necessity of taking into account a semantic component of the similarity value arises, for example by considering the context in which a term is used in an agent ontology. Therefore we propose a clustering technique based on the HISENE semantic negotiation protocol, using a similarity value that has lexical, structural and semantic components. Moreover, we introduce a suitable multiagent architecture that allows computing agent similarities by means of an efficient distributed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1139","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1139","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2053","fieldValue":" Soft errors have become a serious cause of concern with reducing feature sizes. The ability to accommodate complex, Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) cores on a single chip presents a unique opportunity to achieve reliable execution, safe from soft errors, with low performance penalties. In this context, we present FluidCheck, a checker architecture that allows highly flexible assignment and migration of checking duties across cores. In this article, we present a mechanism to dynamically use the resources of SMT cores for checking the results of other threads, and propose a variety of heuristics for migration of such checker threads across cores. Secondly, to make the process of checking more efficient, we propose a set of architectural enhancements that reduce power consumption, decrease the length of the critical path, and reduce the load on the Network-on-Chip (NoC). Based on our observations, we design a 16 core system for running SPEC2006 based bag-of-tasks applications. Our experiments demonstrate that fully reliable execution can be attained with a mere 27&percnt; slowdown, surpassing traditional redundant threading based techniques by roughly 42&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2053","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2053","fieldValue":"ACM"}
