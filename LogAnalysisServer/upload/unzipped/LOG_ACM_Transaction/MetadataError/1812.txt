To perform massively parallel sweep-and-prune (SaP), we mitigate the great density of intervals along the axis of sweep by using principal component analysis to choose the best sweep direction, together with spatial subdivisions to further reduce the number of false positive overlaps. Our algorithm implemented entirely on GPUs using the CUDA framework can handle a million moving objects at interactive rates. As application of our algorithm, we demonstrate the real-time simulation of very large numbers of particles and rigid-body dynamics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16367","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16367","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16368","fieldValue":"Hsu, Shu-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16368","fieldValue":" We present a method for directly modeling piles of objects in multi-body simulations. Piles of objects represent some of the more interesting, but also most time-consuming portion of simulation. We propose a method for reducing computation in many of these situations by explicitly modeling the piles that the objects may form into. By modeling pile behavior rather than the behavior of all individual objects, we can achieve realistic results in less time, and without directly modeling the frictional component that leads to desired pile shapes. Our method is simple to implement and can be easily integrated with existing rigid body simulations. We observe notable speedups in several rigid body examples, and generate a wider variety of piled structures than possible with strict impulse-based simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16368","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16368","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16369","fieldValue":"OBrien, James"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16369","fieldValue":" In this paper we describe a fast strain-limiting method that allows stiff, incompliant materials to be simulated efficiently. Unlike prior approaches, which act on springs or individual strain components, this method acts on the strain tensors in a coordinate-invariant fashion allowing isotropic behavior. Our method applies to both two-and three-dimensional strains, and only requires computing the singular value decomposition of the deformation gradient, either a small 2x2 or 3x3 matrix, for each element. We demonstrate its use with triangular and tetrahedral linear-basis elements. For triangulated surfaces in three-dimensional space, we also describe a complementary edge-angle-limiting method to limit out-of-plane bending. All of the limits are enforced through an iterative, non-linear, Gauss-Seidel-like constraint procedure. To accelerate convergence, we propose a novel multi-resolution algorithm that enforces fitted limits at each level of a non-conforming hierarchy. Compared with other constraint-based techniques, our isotropic multi-resolution strain-limiting method is straightforward to implement, efficient to use, and applicable to a wide range of shell and solid materials."}
