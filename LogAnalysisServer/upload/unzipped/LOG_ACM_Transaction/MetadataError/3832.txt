{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22326","fieldValue":" Access control to IT systems increasingly relies on the ability to compose policies. Hence there is benefit in any framework for policy composition that is intuitive, formal (and so â\u20ACœanalyzableâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœimplementableâ\u20AC?), expressive, independent of specific application domains, and yet able to be extended to create domain-specific instances. Here we develop such a framework based on Belnap logic. An access-control policy is interpreted as a four-valued predicate that maps access requests to either grant, deny, conflict, or unspecified -- the four values of the Belnap bilattice. We define an expressive access-control policy language PBel, having composition operators based on the operators of Belnap logic. Natural orderings on policies are obtained by lifting the truth and information orderings of the Belnap bilattice. These orderings lead to a query language in which policy analyses, for example, conflict freedom, can be specified. Policy analysis is supported through a reduction of the validity of policy queries to the validity of propositional formulas on predicates over access requests. We evaluate our approach through firewall policy and RBAC policy examples, and discuss domain-specific and generic extensions of our policy language."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22327","fieldValue":" The use of privacy-enhancing cryptographic protocols, such as anonymous credentials and oblivious transfer, could have a detrimental effect on the ability of providers to effectively implement access controls on their content. In this article, we propose a stateful anonymous credential system that allows the provider to implement nontrivial, real-world access controls on oblivious protocols conducted with anonymous users. Our system models the behavior of users as a state machine and embeds that state within an anonymous credential to restrict access to resources based on the state information. The use of state machine models of user behavior allows the provider to restrict the users' actions according to a wide variety of access control models without learning anything about the users' identities or actions. Our system is secure in the standard model under basic assumptions and, after an initial setup phase, each transaction requires only constant time. As a concrete example, we show how to implement the Brewer--Nash (Chinese Wall) and Bell-La Padula (Multilevel Security) access control models within our credential system. Furthermore, we combine our credential system with an adaptive oblivious transfer scheme to create a privacy-friendly oblivious database with strong access controls."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22327","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22327","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3130","fieldValue":"Yang, Ya-Ting"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3130","fieldValue":"Zhou, Jun-Lin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3130","fieldValue":" Morphological analysis, which includes analysis of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, stemming, and morpheme segmentation, is one of the key components in natural language processing (NLP), particularly for agglutinative languages. In this article, we investigate the morphological analysis of the Uyghur language, which is the native language of the people in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region of western China. Morphological analysis of Uyghur is challenging primarily because of factors such as (1) ambiguities arising due to the likelihood of association of a multiple number of POS tags with a word stem or a multiple number of functional tags with a word suffix, (2) ambiguous morpheme boundaries, and (3) complex morphopholonogy of the language. Further, the unavailability of a manually annotated training set in the Uyghur language for the purpose of word segmentation makes Uyghur morphological analysis more difficult. In our proposed work, we address these challenges by undertaking a semisupervised approach of learning a Markov model with the help of a manually constructed dictionary of â\u20ACœsuffix to tagâ\u20AC? mappings in order to predict the most likely tag transitions in the Uyghur morpheme sequence. Due to the linguistic characteristics of Uyghur, we incorporate a prior belief in our model for favoring word segmentations with a lower number of morpheme units. Empirical evaluation of our proposed model shows an accuracy of about 82%. We further improve the effectiveness of the tag transition model with an active learning paradigm. In particular, we manually investigated a subset of words for which the model prediction ambiguity was within the top 20%. Manually incorporating rules to handle these erroneous cases resulted in an overall accuracy of 93.81%."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3130","fieldValue":"ACM"}
