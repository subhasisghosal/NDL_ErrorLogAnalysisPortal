Two general interests in this kind of studies are community detection and visualization. In the first case, most of the classic algorithms for community detection use only the structural information to identify groups, that is, how clusters are formed according to the topology of the relationships. However, these methods do not take into account any semantic information which could guide the clustering process, and which may add elements to conduct further analyses. In the second case most of the layout algorithms for clustered graphs have been designed to differentiate the groups within the graph, but they are not designed to analyze the interactions between such groups. Identifying these interactions gives an insight into the way different communities exchange messages or information, and allows the social network researcher to identify key actors, roles, and paths from one community to another. This article presents a novel model to use, in a conjoint way, the semantic information from the social network and its structural information to, first, find structurally and semantically related groups of nodes, and second, a layout algorithm for clustered graphs which divides the nodes into two types, one for nodes with edges connecting other communities and another with nodes connecting nodes only within their own community. With this division the visualization tool focuses on the connections between groups facilitating deep studies of augmented social networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7527","fieldValue":"Community detection and visualization in social networks: Integrating structural and semantic information"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7527","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7527","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7528","fieldValue":" Tag recommendation is focused on recommending useful tags to a user who is annotating a Web resource. A relevant research issue is the recommendation of additional tags to partially annotated resources, which may be based on either personalized or collective knowledge. However, since the annotation process is usually not driven by any controlled vocabulary, the collections of user-specific and collective annotations are often very sparse. Indeed, the discovery of the most significant associations among tags becomes a challenging task. This article presents a novel personalized tag recommendation system that discovers and exploits generalized association rules, that is, tag correlations holding at different abstraction levels, to identify additional pertinent tags to suggest. The use of generalized rules relevantly improves the effectiveness of traditional rule-based systems in coping with sparse tag collections, because: (i) correlations hidden at the level of individual tags may be anyhow figured out at higher abstraction levels and (ii) low-level tag associations discovered from collective data may be exploited to specialize high-level associations discovered in the user-specific context. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been validated against other personalized approaches on real-life and benchmark collections retrieved from the popular photo-sharing system Flickr."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7528","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7529","fieldValue":" The accuracy of collaborative-filtering recommender systems largely depends on three factors: the quality of the rating prediction algorithm, and the quantity and quality of available ratings. While research in the field of recommender systems often concentrates on improving prediction algorithms, even the best algorithms will fail if they are fed poor-quality data during training, that is, garbage in, garbage out. Active learning aims to remedy this problem by focusing on obtaining better-quality data that more aptly reflects a user's preferences. However, traditional evaluation of active learning strategies has two major flaws, which have significant negative ramifications on accurately evaluating the system's performance (prediction error, precision, and quantity of elicited ratings). (1) Performance has been evaluated for each user independently (ignoring system-wide improvements). (2) Active learning strategies have been evaluated in isolation from unsolicited user ratings (natural acquisition). In this article we show that an elicited rating has effects across the system, so a typical user-centric evaluation which ignores any changes of rating prediction of other users also ignores these cumulative effects, which may be more influential on the performance of the system as a whole (system centric). We propose a new evaluation methodology and use it to evaluate some novel and state-of-the-art rating elicitation strategies. We found that the system-wide effectiveness of a rating elicitation strategy depends on the stage of the rating elicitation process, and on the evaluation measures (MAE, NDCG, and Precision). In particular, we show that using some common user-centric strategies may actually degrade the overall performance of a system. Finally, we show that the performance of many common active learning strategies changes significantly when evaluated concurrently with the natural acquisition of ratings in recommender systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7529","fieldValue":"Active learning strategies for rating elicitation in collaborative filtering: A system-wide perspective"}
