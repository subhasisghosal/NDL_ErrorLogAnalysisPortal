It is sufficiently expressive to describe both the desired behavior of systems, their specifications, and their actual implementations in terms of simpler components. We say I satisfies S if 1 is a correct implementation of the specification S. We briefly discuss a semantic treatment of this notion of satisfaction, but the main emphasis of the paper is on a proof technique for proving statements of the form I satisfies S, based on syntactic transformations and induction. Two examples are given, both systolic systems from the literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2916","fieldValue":"Chan, Kwok-Ping"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2916","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a new postprocessing strategy, word suggestion, based on a multiple word trigger-pair language model for Chinese character recognizers. With the word suggestion strategy, Chinese character recognizers may even achieve a recognition rate greater than the top-n candidate recognition rate. To construct the multiple word trigger-pair model, data mining techniques are used to alleviate the intensive computation problem. Furthermore, rough set theory is first used in the study to discover negatively correlated relationships between words in order to prevent introducing wrong words in the process of word suggestion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2916","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2916","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20019","fieldValue":" The problem of correctness of the solutions to the distributed termination problem of Francez [7] is addressed. Correctness criteria are formalized in the customary framework for program correctness. A very simple proof method is proposed and applied to show correctness of a solution to the problem. It allows us to reason about liveness properties of temporal logic (see, e.g., Manna and Pnueli [12]) using a new notion of weak total correctness."}
