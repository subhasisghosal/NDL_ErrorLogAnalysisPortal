The core of the proposed method is a JFA model by which we extract features. These features can either represent overall utterances or individual digits, and are fed into a trainable backend to estimate likelihood ratios. Within this framework, several extensions are proposed. First is a logistic regression method for combining log-likelihood ratios that correspond to individual mixture components. Second is the extraction of phonetically aware Baum--Welch statistics, by using forced alignment instead of the typical posterior probabilities that are derived by the universal background model. We also explore a digit-string-dependent way to apply score normalization that exhibits a notable improvement compared to the standard one. By fusing six JFA features, we attained 2.01% and 3.19% equal error rates on male and female, respectively, on the challenging RSR2015 (part III) dataset."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4053","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4053","fieldValue":"ACM"}
