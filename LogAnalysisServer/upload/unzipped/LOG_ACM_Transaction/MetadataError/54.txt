We also evaluate the benefits of such parallel paradigm with respect to other approaches. We use the PARSEC benchmark suite as our test bed, which includes applications representative of a wide range of domains from HPC to desktop and server applications. We adopt different parallelization techniques, tailored to the needs of each application, to fully exploit the task-based model. Our evaluation shows that task parallelism achieves better performance than thread-based parallelization models, such as Pthreads. Our experimental results show that we can obtain scalability improvements up to 42&percnt; on a 16-core system and code size reductions up to 81&percnt;. Such reductions are achieved by removing from the source code application specific schedulers or thread pooling systems and transferring these responsibilities to the runtime system software."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2015","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11132","fieldValue":" The Students and Technology in Academia, Research, and Service (STARS) Alliance is a nationally-connected system of regional partnerships among higher education, K-12 schools, industry and the community with a mission to broaden the participation of women, under-represented minorities and persons with disabilities in computing (BPC). Each regional partnership is led by a STARS member college or university with partners such as local chapters of the Girl Scouts, the Black Data Processors Association, public libraries, Citizen Schools, and companies that employ computing graduates. STARS goals include retaining and graduating undergraduates and recruiting and bridging undergraduates into graduate programs. The alliance works toward these goals through activities that advance the central values of Technical Excellence, Leadership, Community, and Service and Civic Engagement. In particular, all STARS college and university members implement the STARS Leadership Corps (SLC), an innovative model for enveloping a diverse set of BPC practices within a common framework for implementation within multiple organizations, common assessment, and sustainability through curricula integration. Herein, we describe the SLC model and its implementation in the STARS schools, including details of an SLC service-learning course that has been adopted by eight STARS schools. We report the results of our three-year study of the SLC in the 20 STARS schools. Our study found a positive effect of participation in the SLC on important student success variables, including self-efficacy, perceived social relevance of computing, grade point average, and commitment to remain in computing. Results indicate that the SLC model is effective for students under-represented in computing, as well as for those not from under-represented groups."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11132","fieldValue":"BPC"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11132","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11133","fieldValue":" Universal design (UD), a concept that grew from the field of architecture, has recently emerged as a paradigm for designing instructional methods, curriculum, and assessments that are welcoming and accessible to students with a wide range of characteristics, including those related to race, ethnicity, native language, gender, age, and disability. This proactive approach holds promise for more fully including underrepresented groups in computing studies and for decreasing the need, and thus costs, for academic accommodations for students with disabilities. This article summarizes the history and development of UD, references research and practices that support the UD approach, provides examples of the strategies that apply UD to instruction and assessment, and recommends topics for future research. Although the application of UD to teaching and learning is in its infancy, the potential of UD to improve computing instruction should not be ignored. Further research could test the efficacy of specific UD practices in promoting learning in computing fields."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11133","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11133","fieldValue":"ACM"}
