This paper presents the development of a scalable broadcast authentication scheme named multilevel μTESLA based on μTESLA, a broadcast authentication protocol whose scalability is limited by its unicast-based initial parameter distribution. Multilevel μTESLA satisfies several nice properties, including low overhead, tolerance of message loss, scalability to large networks, and resistance to replay attacks as well as denial-of-service attacks. This paper also presents the experimental results obtained through simulation, which demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme under severe denial-of-service attacks and poor channel quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6216","fieldValue":"TESLA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6216","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6216","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6217","fieldValue":"Chang, Li-Pin"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6217","fieldValue":"Kuo, Tei-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6217","fieldValue":"Lo, Shi-Wu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6217","fieldValue":" Flash-memory technology is becoming critical in building embedded systems applications because of its shock-resistant, power economic, and nonvolatile nature. With the recent technology breakthroughs in both capacity and reliability, flash-memory storage systems are now very popular in many types of embedded systems. However, because flash memory is a write-once and bulk-erase medium, we need a translation layer and a garbage-collection mechanism to provide applications a transparent storage service. In the past work, various techniques were introduced to improve the garbage-collection mechanism. These techniques aimed at both performance and endurance issues, but they all failed in providing applications a guaranteed performance. In this paper, we propose a real-time garbage-collection mechanism, which provides a guaranteed performance, for hard real-time systems. On the other hand, the proposed mechanism supports non-real-time tasks so that the potential bandwidth of the storage system can be fully utilized. A wear-leveling method, which is executed as a non-real-time service, is presented to resolve the endurance problem of flash memory. The capability of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated by a series of experiments over our system prototype."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6217","fieldValue":"ACM"}
