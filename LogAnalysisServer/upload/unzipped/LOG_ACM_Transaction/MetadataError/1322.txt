Agilla provides a programming model in which applications consist of evolving communities of agents that share a wireless sensor network. Coordination among the agents and access to physical resources are supported by a tuple space abstraction. Agents can dynamically enter and exit a network and can autonomously clone and migrate themselves in response to environmental changes. Agilla's ability to support self-adaptive applications in wireless sensor networks has been demonstrated in the context of several applications, including fire detection and tracking, monitoring cargo containers, and robot navigation. Agilla, the first mobile agent system to operate in resource-constrained wireless sensor platforms, was implemented on top of TinyOS. Agilla's feasibility and efficiency was demonstrated by experimental evaluation on two physical testbeds consisting of Mica2 and TelosB nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1169","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1169","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2428","fieldValue":"Tardos, VA"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2428","fieldValue":" We introduce a facility location problem with submodular facility cost functions, and give an O(log n) approximation algorithm for it. Then we focus on a special case of submodular costs, called hierarchical facility costs, and give a (4.237 + &epsis;)-approximation algorithm using local search. The hierarchical facility costs model multilevel service installation. Shmoys et al. &lsqb;2004&rsqb; gave a constant factor approximation algorithm for a two-level version of the problem. Here we consider a multilevel problem, and give a constant factor approximation algorithm, independent of the number of levels, for the case of identical costs on all facilities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2428","fieldValue":"ACM"}
