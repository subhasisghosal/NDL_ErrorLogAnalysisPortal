Despite the lack of generic methodology, the reactive approach is interesting considering the properties it provides. This article presents a problem-solving model based on a swarm approach where agents interact using physics-inspired mechanisms. The initial problem and its constraints are represented through agents' environment, the dynamics of which is part of the problem-solving process. This model is then applied to localization and target tracking. Experiments assess our approach and compare it to widely-used classical algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1113","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1113","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1750","fieldValue":"Garca-Guirado, Antonio"}
