{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16518","fieldValue":" We present a framework for generating content-adaptive macros that can transfer complex photo manipulations to new target images. We demonstrate applications of our framework to face, landscape, and global manipulations. To create a content-adaptive macro, we make use of multiple training demonstrations. Specifically, we use automated image labeling and machine learning techniques to learn the dependencies between image features and the parameters of each selection, brush stroke, and image processing operation in the macro. Although our approach is limited to learning manipulations where there is a direct dependency between image features and operation parameters, we show that our framework is able to learn a large class of the most commonly used manipulations using as few as 20 training demonstrations. Our framework also provides interactive controls to help macro authors and users generate training demonstrations and correct errors due to incorrect labeling or poor parameter estimation. We ask viewers to compare images generated using our content-adaptive macros with and without corrections to manually generated ground-truth images and find that they consistently rate both our automatic and corrected results as close in appearance to the ground truth. We also evaluate the utility of our proposed macro generation workflow via a small informal lab study with professional photographers. The study suggests that our workflow is effective and practical in the context of real-world photo editing."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16518","fieldValue":"A Framework for content-adaptive photo manipulation macros: Application to face, landscape, and global manipulations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16518","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16519","fieldValue":" We propose a fast physically-based simulation system for skeleton-driven deformable body characters. Our system can generate realistic motions of self-propelled deformable body characters by considering the two-way interactions among the skeleton, the deformable body, and the environment in the dynamic simulation. It can also compute the passive jiggling behavior of a deformable body driven by a kinematic skeletal motion. We show that a well-coordinated combination of: (1) a reduced deformable body model with nonlinear finite elements, (2) a linear-time algorithm for skeleton dynamics, and (3) explicit integration can boost simulation speed to orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, while preserving modeling accuracy as much as possible. Parallel computation on the GPU has also been implemented to obtain an additional speedup for complicated characters. Detailed discussions of our engineering decisions for speed and accuracy of the simulation system are presented in the article. We tested our approach with a variety of skeleton-driven deformable body characters, and the tested characters were simulated in real time or near real time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16519","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16519","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16520","fieldValue":"Chang, Chia-Tche"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16520","fieldValue":" An exact algorithm to compute an optimal 3D oriented bounding box was published in 1985 by Joseph O'Rourke, but it is slow and extremely hard to implement. In this article we propose a new approach, where the computation of the minimal-volume OBB is formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem on the rotation group SO(3,â\u201E?). It is solved using a hybrid method combining the genetic and Nelder-Mead algorithms. This method is analyzed and then compared to the current state-of-the-art techniques.
