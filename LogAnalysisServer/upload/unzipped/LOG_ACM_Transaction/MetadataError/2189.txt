A common approach for computing a map between surfaces is to cut the surfaces to disks, flatten them to the plane, and extract the mapping from the flattenings by composing one flattening with the inverse of the other. So far, a significant drawback in this class of techniques is that the choice of cuts introduces a bias in the computation of the map that often causes visible artifacts and wrong correspondences. In this paper we develop a surface mapping technique that is indifferent to the particular cut choice. This is achieved by a novel type of surface flattenings that encodes this cut-invariance, and when optimized with a suitable energy functional results in a seamless surface-to-surface map. We show the algorithm enables producing high-quality seamless bijective maps for pairs of surfaces with a wide range of shape variability and from a small number of prescribed correspondences. We also used this framework to produce three-way, consistent and seamless mappings for triplets of surfaces."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17320","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17321","fieldValue":" We present a framework for the computation of harmonic and conformal mappings in the plane with mathematical guarantees that the computed mappings are $C^âˆž$, locally injective and satisfy strict bounds on the conformal and isometric distortion. Such mappings are very desirable in many computer graphics and geometry processing applications. We establish the sufficient and necessary conditions for a harmonic planar mapping to have bounded distortion. Our key observation is that these conditions relate solely to the boundary behavior of the mapping. This leads to an efficient and accurate algorithm that supports handle-based interactive shape-and-image deformation and is demonstrated to outperform other state-of-the-art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17321","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17322","fieldValue":"Levin, David I W"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17322","fieldValue":" Crafting the behavior of a deformable object is difficult---whether it is a biomechanically accurate character model or a new multimaterial 3D printable design. Getting it right requires constant iteration, performed either manually or driven by an automated system. Unfortunately, Previous algorithms for accelerating three-dimensional finite element analysis of elastic objects suffer from expensive precomputation stages that rely on a priori knowledge of the object's geometry and material composition. In this paper we introduce Data-Driven Finite Elements as a solution to this problem. Given a material palette, our method constructs a metamaterial library which is reusable for subsequent simulations, regardless of object geometry and\/or material composition. At runtime, we perform fast coarsening of a simulation mesh using a simple table lookup to select the appropriate metamaterial model for the coarsened elements. When the object's material distribution or geometry changes, we do not need to update the metamaterial library---we simply need to update the metamaterial assignments to the coarsened elements. An important advantage of our approach is that it is applicable to non-linear material models. This is important for designing objects that undergo finite deformation (such as those produced by multimaterial 3D printing). Our method yields speed gains of up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining good accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on both virtual and 3D printed examples in order to show its utility as a tool for deformable object design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17322","fieldValue":"ACM"}
