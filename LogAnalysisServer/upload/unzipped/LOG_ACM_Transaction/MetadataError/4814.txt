However, retrieval performance depends heavily on the means of interaction. We argue that effective CBVR requires efficient, specialized user interfaces. In this article we propose guidelines for such an interface, and we propose an effective CBVR engine: the ForkBrowser, which builds upon the principle of focus and context. This browser is evaluated using a combination of user simulation and real user evaluation. Results indicate that the ideas have merit, and that the browser performs very well when compared to the state-of-the-art in video retrieval."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3461","fieldValue":" Interpretations of vibrotactile stimulations were compared between two participant groups. In both groups, the task was to evaluate specifically designed tactile stimulations presented to the wrist or chest. Ascending, constant, and descending vibration frequency profiles of the stimuli represented information for three different speed regulation instructions: â\u20ACœaccelerate your speed,â\u20AC? â\u20ACœkeep your speed constant,â\u20AC? and â\u20ACœdecelerate your speed,â\u20AC? respectively. The participants were treated differently so that one of the groups was first taught (i.e., primed) the meanings of the stimuli, whereas the other group was not taught (i.e., unprimed). The results showed that the stimuli were evaluated nearly equally in the primed and the unprimed groups. The best performing stimuli communicated the three intended meanings in the rate of 88&percnt; to 100&percnt; in the primed group and in the unprimed group in the rate of 71&percnt; to 83&percnt;. Both groups performed equally in evaluating â\u20ACœkeep your speed constantâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœdecelerate your speedâ\u20AC? information. As the unprimed participants performed similarly to the primed participants, the results suggest that vibrotactile stimulation can be intuitively understood. The results suggest further that carefully designed vibrotactile stimulations could be functional in delivering easy-to-understand feedback on how to regulate the speed of movement, such as in physical exercise and rehabilitation applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3461","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3461","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25478","fieldValue":" Olfaction is an exciting challenge facing multimedia applications.
