The visual stimulus was a checkerboard image in a head mounted display that moved from side-to-side. Observers rated the magnitude of the checkerboard motion while either rotating their head about a vertical axis (yaw), about a horizontal axis (pitch), or holding it still. In Experiment 1, we tested four image oscillation frequencies (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 Hz) while holding the head motion frequency constant at 0.5 Hz. In Experiment 2, we tested three head motion frequencies (0.25, 0.5, and 1 Hz) while holding the image oscillation frequency constant at 1 Hz. Across all image and head motion frequencies, perceptual sensitivity to image motion was reduced by about 45&percnt; during horizontal head movement. During vertical head movement, perceptual sensitivity was reduced by about 25&percnt; when head and image motion were of the same frequency. Compared with when the head was still, horizontal and vertical head movements produced a downward shift of about 10&percnt; in overall motion magnitude estimation response. Findings from this study provide virtual environment developers with a quantitative description of the influence of concurrent head movement on the perception of frontoparallel image motion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3341","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3341","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24093","fieldValue":"Culpepper, J Shane"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24093","fieldValue":"Croft, W Bruce"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24093","fieldValue":" Formulating and processing phrases and other term dependencies to improve query effectiveness is an important problem in information retrieval. However, accessing word-sequence statistics using inverted indexes requires unreasonable processing time or substantial space overhead. Establishing a balance between these competing space and time trade-offs can dramatically improve system performance. In this article, we present and analyze a new index structure designed to improve query efficiency in dependency retrieval models. By adapting a class of (Îµ, Î\u201D)-approximation algorithms originally proposed for sketch summarization in networking applications, we show how to accurately estimate statistics important in term-dependency models with low, probabilistically bounded error rates. The space requirements for the vocabulary of the index is only logarithmically linked to the size of the vocabulary. Empirically, we show that the sketch index can reduce the space requirements of the vocabulary component of an index of n-grams consisting of between 1 and 4 words extracted from the GOV2 collection to less than 0.01&percnt; of the space requirements of the vocabulary of a full index. We also show that larger n-gram queries can be processed considerably more efficiently than in current alternatives, such as positional and next-word indexes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24094","fieldValue":" Advances in tourism economics have enabled us to collect massive amounts of travel tour data. If properly analyzed, this data could be a source of rich intelligence for providing real-time decision making and for the provision of travel tour recommendations. However, tour recommendation is quite different from traditional recommendations, because the touristâ\u20AC™s choice is affected directly by the travel costs, which includes both financial and time costs. To that end, in this article, we provide a focused study of cost-aware tour recommendation. Along this line, we first propose two ways to represent user cost preference. One way is to represent user cost preference by a two-dimensional vector. Another way is to consider the uncertainty about the cost that a user can afford and introduce a Gaussian prior to model user cost preference. With these two ways of representing user cost preference, we develop different cost-aware latent factor models by incorporating the cost information into the probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) model, the logistic probabilistic matrix factorization (LPMF) model, and the maximum margin matrix factorization (MMMF) model, respectively. When applied to real-world travel tour data, all the cost-aware recommendation models consistently outperform existing latent factor models with a significant margin."}
