The spatial knowledge of human participants was assessed after they had learned the relative positions of London Underground stations on a map via passive, marginally active, or active exploration. Following learning, the participants were required to answer questions in relation to the spatial representation and distribution of the stations on the map. Performances were compared between conditions involving (1) without auditory cues versus continuous auditory cues; (2) without auditory cues versus noncontinuous auditory cues; and (3) continuous auditory cues versus noncontinuous auditory cues. Results showed that the participants perfomed better following active and marginally-active explorations, as compared to purely passive learning. These results also suggest that under specific conditions (i.e., continuous sound with extremely fast tempo) there is no benefit to spatial abilities from active exploration over passive observation; while continuous sound with moderate to fast tempo is effective for simple actions (i.e., key press)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3421","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3421","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25023","fieldValue":" Most popular simulation and emulation tools use high-level models of forwarding behavior in switches and routers, and give little guidance on setting model parameters such as buffer sizes. Thus, a myriad of papers report results that are highly sensitive to the forwarding model or buffer size used. Incorrect conclusions are often drawn from these results about transport or application protocol performance, service provisioning, or vulnerability to attacks. In this article, we argue that measurement-based models for routers and other forwarding devices are necessary. We devise such a model and validate it with measurements from three types of Cisco routers and one Juniper router, under varying traffic conditions. The structure of our model is device-independent, but the model uses device specific parameters. The compactness of the parameters and simplicity of the model make it versatile for high-fidelity simulations that preserve simulation scalability. We construct a profiler to infer the parameters within a few hours. Our results indicate that our model approximates different types of routers significantly better than the default ns-2 simulator models. The results also indicate that queue characteristics vary dramatically among the devices we measure, and that backplane contention can be a factor."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25023","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25023","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25024","fieldValue":" Importance splitting is a simulation technique to estimate very small entrance probabilities for Markov processes by splitting sample paths at various stages before reaching the set of interest. This can be done in many ways, yielding different variants of the method. In this context, we propose a new one, called fixed number of successes. We prove unbiasedness for the new and some known variants, because in many papers, the proof is based on an incorrect argument. Further, we analyze its behavior in a simplified setting in terms of efficiency and asymptotics in comparison to the standard variant. The main difference is that it controls the imprecision of the estimator rather than the computational effort. Our analysis and simulation examples show that it is rather robust in terms of parameter choice and we present a two-stage procedure which also yields confidence intervals."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25024","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25024","fieldValue":"ACM"}
