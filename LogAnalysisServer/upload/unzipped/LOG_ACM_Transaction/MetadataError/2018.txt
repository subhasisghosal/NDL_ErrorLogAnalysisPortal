The key difficulty is that existing techniques lack adequate temporal coherence to animate these styles effectively. Here we augment the range of practical animation styles by extending the guided texture synthesis method of Image Analogies [Hertzmann et al. 2001] to create temporally coherent animation sequences. To make the method art directable, we allow artists to paint portions of keyframes that are used as constraints. The in-betweens calculated by our method maintain stylistic continuity and yet change no more than necessary over time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2600","fieldValue":" We analyze several distributed, continuous time protocols for a fair allocation of bandwidths to flows in a network (or resources to agents). Our protocols converge to an allocation that is a logarithmic approximation, simultaneously, to all canonical social welfare functions (i.e., functions that are symmetric, concave, and nondecreasing). These protocols can be started in an arbitrary state. Although a similar protocol was known before, it only applied to the simple bandwidth allocation problem, and its stability and convergence time were not understood. In contrast, our protocols also apply to the more general case of Leontief utilities, where each user may place a different requirement on each resource. Furthermore, we prove that our protocols converge in polynomial time. The best convergence time we prove is O (n log ncMAX aMAX\/cMINaMIN), where n is the number of agents in the network, cMAX and cMIN are the maximum and minimum capacity of the links, and $a_max, amin$ are respectively the largest and smallest Leontief coefficients. This time is achieved by a simple Multiplicative Increase, Multiplicative Decrease (MIMD) protocol that had not been studied before in this setting. We also identify combinatorial properties of these protocols that may be useful in proving stronger convergence bounds. The final allocations by our protocols are supported by usage-sensitive dual prices that are fair in the sense that they shield light users of a resource from the impact of heavy users. Thus, our protocols can also be thought of as efficient distributed schemes for computing fair prices."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2600","fieldValue":"Price-based protocols for fair resource allocation: Convergence time analysis and extension to leontief utilities"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16901","fieldValue":" For the visualization of dense line fields, the careful selection of lines to be rendered is a vital aspect. In this paper, we present a global line selection approach that is based on an optimization process. Starting with an initial set of lines that covers the domain, all lines are rendered with a varying opacity, which is subject to the minimization of a bounded-variable least-squares problem. The optimization strives to keep a balance between information presentation and occlusion avoidance. This way, we obtain view-dependent opacities of the line segments, allowing a real-time free navigation while minimizing the danger of missing important structures in the visualization. We compare our technique with existing local and greedy approaches and apply it to data sets in flow visualization, medical imaging, physics, and computer graphics."}
