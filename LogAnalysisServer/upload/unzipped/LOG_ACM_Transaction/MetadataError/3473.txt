Use of data mules significantly reduces energy consumption at sensor nodes compared to commonly used multihop forwarding approaches, but has a drawback in that it increases the latency of data delivery. Optimizing the motion of data mules, including path and speed, is critical for improving the data delivery latency and making the data mule approach more useful in practice. In this article, we focus on the path selection problem: finding the optimal path of data mules so that the data delivery latency can be minimized. We formulate the path selection problem as a graph problem that is capable of expressing the benefit from larger communication range. The problem is NP-hard and we present approximation algorithms for both single-data mule case and multiple-data mules case. We further consider the case in which we have only partial knowledge of communication range, where we design semionline algorithms that improve the offline plan using online knowledge at runtime. Simulation experiments on Matlab and ns2 demonstrate that our offline and semionline algorithms produce significantly shorter path lengths and data delivery latency compared to previously proposed methods, suggesting that controlled mobility can be exploited much more effectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21362","fieldValue":" As many radio chips used in todayâ\u20AC™s sensor mote hardware can work at different frequencies, several multichannel communication protocols have recently been proposed to improve network throughput and reduce packet loss for wireless sensor networks. However, existing work cannot utilize multiple channels to provide explicit guarantees for application-specified end-to-end communication delays, which are critical to many real-time applications such as surveillance and disaster response. In this article, we propose MCRT, a multichannel real-time communication protocol that features a flow-based channel allocation strategy. Because of the small number of orthogonal channels available in current mote hardware, MCRT allocates channels to network partitions formed based on many-to-one data flows. To achieve bounded end-to-end communication delay for every data flow, the channel allocation problem has been formulated as a constrained optimization problem and proven to be NP-complete. We then present the design of MCRT, which includes a channel allocation algorithm and a real-time packet forwarding strategy. Extensive simulation results based on a realistic radio model and empirical results on a real hardware testbed of Tmote nodes both demonstrate that MCRT can effectively utilize multiple channels to reduce the number of deadlines missed in end-to-end communications. Our results also show that MCRT outperforms a state-of-the-art real-time protocol and two baseline multichannel communication schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21362","fieldValue":"ACM"}
