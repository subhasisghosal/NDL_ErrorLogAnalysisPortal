Our profiler is implemented in a production-quality optimizing compiler for Haskell and can successfully profile large applications. A unique feature of our approach is that we give a formal specification of the attribution of execution costs to cost centers. This specification enables us to discuss our design decisions in a precise framework, prove properties about the attribution of costs, and examine to effects of different program transformations on the attribution of costs. Since it is not obvious how to map this specification onto a particular implementation, we also present an implementation-oriented operational semantics, and prove it equivalent to the specification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2945","fieldValue":" Spoken Language Translation (SLT) is the research area that focuses on the translation of speech or text between two spoken languages. Phrase-based and syntax-based methods represent the state-of-the-art for statistical machine translation (SMT). The phrase-based method specializes in modeling local reorderings and translations of multiword expressions. The syntax-based method is enhanced by using syntactic knowledge, which can better model long word reorderings, discontinuous phrases, and syntactic structure. In this article, we leverage on the strength of these two methods and propose a strategy based on multiple hypotheses generation in a two-stage framework for spoken language translation. The hypotheses are generated in two stages, namely, decoding and regeneration. In the decoding stage, we apply state-of-the-art, phrase-based, and syntax-based methods to generate basic translation hypotheses. Then in the regeneration stage, much more hypotheses that cannot be captured by the decoding algorithms are produced from the basic hypotheses. We study three regeneration methods: redecoding, n-gram expansion, and confusion network in the second stage. Finally, an additional reranking pass is introduced to select the translation outputs by a linear combination of rescoring models. Experimental results on the Chinese-to-English IWSLT-2006 challenge task of translating the transcription of spontaneous speech show that the proposed mechanism achieves significant improvements over the baseline of about 2.80 BLEU-score."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2945","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/20338","fieldValue":"Clarke, Charles L A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20338","fieldValue":" The use of regular expressions for text search is widely known and well understood. It is then surprising that the standard techniques and tools prove to be of limited use for searching structured text formatted with SGML or similar markup languages. Our experience with structured text search has caused us to reexamine the current practice. The generally accepted rule of â\u20ACœleftmost longest matchâ\u20AC? is an unfortunate choice and is at the root of the difficulties. We instead propose a rule which is semantically cleaner. This rule is generally applicable to a variety of text search applications, including source code analysis, and has interesting properties in its own right. We have written a publicly available search tool implementing the theory in the article, which has proved valuable in a variety of circumstances."}
