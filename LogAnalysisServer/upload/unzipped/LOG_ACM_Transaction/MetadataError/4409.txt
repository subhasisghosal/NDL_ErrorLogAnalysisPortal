In this context, algorithms that use and exploit structural information about the Web perform better than generic methods in both efficiency and reliability.We present an extensive characterization of the graph structure of the Web, with a view to enabling high-performance applications that make use of this structure. In particular, we show that the Web emerges as the outcome of a number of essentially independent stochastic processes that evolve at various scales. A striking consequence of this scale invariance is that the structure of the Web is \"fractal\"---cohesive subregions display the same characteristics as the Web at large. An understanding of this underlying fractal nature is therefore applicable to designing data services across multiple domains and scales.We describe potential applications of this line of research to optimized algorithm design for Web-scale data analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24270","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24270","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24271","fieldValue":" Server-driven consistency protocols can reduce read latency and improve data freshness for a given network and server overhead, compared to the traditional consistency protocols that rely on client polling. Server-driven consistency protocols appear particularly attractive for large-scale dynamic Web workloads because dynamically generated data can change rapidly and unpredictably. However, there have been few reports on engineering server-driven consistency for such workloads. This article reports our experience in engineering server-driven consistency for a sporting and event Web site hosted by IBM, one of the most popular sites on the Internet for the duration of the event. We also examine an e-commerce site for a national retail store. Our study focuses on scalability and cachability of dynamic content. To assess scalability, we measure both the amount of state that a server needs to maintain to ensure consistency and the bursts of load in sending out invalidation messages when a popular object is modified. We find that server-driven protocols can cap the size of the server's state to a given amount without significant performance costs, and can smooth the bursts of load with minimal impact on the consistency guarantees. To improve performance, we systematically investigate several design issues for which prior research has suggested widely different solutions, including whether servers should send invalidations to idle clients. Finally, we quantify the performance impact of caching dynamic data with server-driven consistency protocols and the benefits of server-driven consistency protocols for large-scale dynamic Web services. We find that (i) caching dynamically generated data can increase cache hit rates by up to 10&percnt;, compared to the systems that do not cache dynamically generated data; and (ii) server-driven consistency protocols can increase cache hit rates by a factor of 1.5-3 for large-scale dynamic Web services, compared to client polling protocols. We have implemented a prototype of a server-driven consistency protocol based on our findings by augmenting the popular Squid cache."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24272","fieldValue":" Previous research has shown that researchers can generate medical hypotheses by using computers to analyze several, seemingly unrelated, medical literatures. In this work we suggest broader application for the ideas of literature-based discovery. Specifically, we suggest that literature-based discovery can be fruitful in areas other than medicine; that in addition to finding \"cures\" for \"problems,\" literature-based discovery offers the possibility of finding new problems for existing technologies; that the analysis of a single literature may be sufficient for literature-based discovery; and that literature-based discovery can support individuals seeking to draw together ideas from various areas of inquiry, even if such connections have been previously made by others.We describe literature-based discovery experiments conducted on the World Wide Web that support these ideas."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24272","fieldValue":"ACM"}
