One common method for saving energy is to simply suspend the system during idle times. No energy is consumed in the suspend mode. However, the process of waking up the system itself requires a certain fixed amount of energy, and thus suspending the system is beneficial only if the idle time is long enough to compensate for this additional energy expenditure. In the specific problem studied in the article, we have a set of jobs with release times and deadlines that need to be executed on a single processor. Preemptions are allowed. The processor requires energy L to be woken up and, when it is on, it uses one unit of energy per one unit of time. It has been an open problem whether a schedule minimizing the overall energy consumption can be computed in polynomial time. We solve this problem in positive, by providing an $O(n^5)-time algorithm. In addition we provide an O(n4$)-time algorithm for computing the minimum energy schedule when all jobs have unit length."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2543","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2543","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16279","fieldValue":" We introduce methods for optimizing physics-based walking controllers for robustness to uncertainty. Many unknown factors, such as external forces, control torques, and user control inputs, cannot be known in advance and must be treated as uncertain. These variables are represented with probability distributions, and a return function scores the desirability of a single motion. Controller optimization entails maximizing the expected value of the return, which is computed by Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate examples with different sources of uncertainty and task constraints. Optimizing control strategies under uncertainty increases robustness and produces natural variations in style."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16279","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16280","fieldValue":" Real-time adaptation of a motion capture sequence to virtual environments with physical perturbations requires robust control strategies. This paper describes an optimal feedback controller for motion tracking that allows for on-the-fly re-planning of long-term goals and adjustments in the final completion time. We first solve an offline optimal trajectory problem for an abstract dynamic model that captures the essential relation between contact forces and momenta. A feedback control policy is then derived and used to simulate the abstract model online. Simulation results become dynamic constraints for online reconstruction of full-body motion from a reference. We applied our controller to a wide range of motions including walking, long stepping, and a squat exercise. Results show that our controllers are robust to large perturbations and changes in the environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16280","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16280","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16281","fieldValue":" This paper addresses the problem of remapping the disparity range of stereoscopic images and video. Such operations are highly important for a variety of issues arising from the production, live broadcast, and consumption of 3D content. Our work is motivated by the observation that the displayed depth and the resulting 3D viewing experience are dictated by a complex combination of perceptual, technological, and artistic constraints. We first discuss the most important perceptual aspects of stereo vision and their implications for stereoscopic content creation. We then formalize these insights into a set of basic disparity mapping operators. These operators enable us to control and retarget the depth of a stereoscopic scene in a nonlinear and locally adaptive fashion. To implement our operators, we propose a new strategy based on stereoscopic warping of the input video streams. From a sparse set of stereo correspondences, our algorithm computes disparity and image-based saliency estimates, and uses them to compute a deformation of the input views so as to meet the target disparities. Our approach represents a practical solution for actual stereo production and display that does not require camera calibration, accurate dense depth maps, occlusion handling, or inpainting. We demonstrate the performance and versatility of our method using examples from live action post-production, 3D display size adaptation, and live broadcast. An additional user study and ground truth comparison further provide evidence for the quality and practical relevance of the presented work."}
