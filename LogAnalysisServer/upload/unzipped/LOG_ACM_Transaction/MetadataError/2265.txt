A high-intensity laser excites physical matter to emit light at an arbitrary three-dimensional position. Popular applications can thus be explored, especially because plasma induced by a femtosecond laser is less harmful than that generated by a nanosecond laser. There are two methods of rendering graphics with a femtosecond laser in air: producing holograms using spatial light modulation technology and scanning of a laser beam by a galvano mirror. The holograms and workspace of the system proposed here occupy a volume of up to 1 $cm^3$; however, this size is scalable depending on the optical devices and their setup. This article provides details of the principles, system setup, and experimental evaluation, and discusses the scalability, design space, and applications of this system. We tested two laser sources: an adjustable (30--100fs) laser that projects up to 1,000 pulses\/s at an energy of up to 7mJ\/pulse and a 269fs laser that projects up to 200,000 pulses\/s at an energy of up to 50Î¼J\/pulse. We confirmed that the spatiotemporal resolution of volumetric displays implemented using these laser sources is 4,000 and 200,000 dots\/s, respectively. Although we focus on laser-induced plasma in air, the discussion presented here is also applicable to other rendering principles such as fluorescence and microbubbles in solid or liquid materials."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17513","fieldValue":"Fairy Lights in Femtoseconds: Aerial and Volumetric Graphics Rendered by Focused Femtosecond Laser Combined with Computational Holographic Fields"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2656","fieldValue":" We study the k-route cut problem: given an undirected edge-weighted graph G &equals; (V, E), a collection ${(s_1, t1), (s2, t2), â\u20AC¦, (sr, tr)} of source-sink pairs, and an integer connectivity requirement k, the goal is to find a minimum-weight subset Eâ\u20AC² of edges to remove, such that the connectivity of every pair (si, ti) falls below k. Specifically, in the edge-connectivity version, EC-kRC, the requirement is that there are at most (k âˆ\u2019 1) edge-disjoint paths connecting si to ti$ in G&setmn;Eâ\u20AC², while in the vertex-connectivity version, VC-kRC, the same requirement is for vertex-disjoint paths. Prior to our work, poly-logarithmic approximation algorithms have been known for the special case where k &les; 3, but no non-trivial approximation algorithms were known for any value k > 3, except in the single-source setting. We show an O(klog$ ^3\/2r)-approximation algorithm for EC-kRC with uniform edge weights, and several polylogarithmic bi-criteria approximation algorithms for EC-kRC and VC-kRC, where the connectivity requirement k is violated by a constant factor. We complement these upper bounds by proving that VC-kRC is hard to approximate to within a factor of k&epsi;$ for some fixed &epsi; > 0. We then turn to study a simpler version of VC-kRC, where only one source-sink pair is present. We give a simple bi-criteria approximation algorithm for this case, and show evidence that even this restricted version of the problem may be hard to approximate. For example, we prove that the single source-sink pair version of VC-kRC has no constant-factor approximation, assuming Feigeâ\u20AC™s Random Îº-AND assumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2656","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-route cut problem"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2656","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-route cut problem"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2656","fieldValue":"ACM"}
