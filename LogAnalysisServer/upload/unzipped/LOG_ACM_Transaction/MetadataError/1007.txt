Its most outstanding feature is that any record can be retrieved in exactly one disk access. This is achieved by using a small amount of supplemental internal storage that stores enough information to uniquely determine the current location of any record. The amount of internal storage required is small: typically one byte for each page of the file. The necessary address computation, insertion, and expansion algorithms are presented and the performance is studied by means of simulation. The new method is the first practical method offering one-access retrieval for large dynamic files."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14078","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14078","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14079","fieldValue":" Relaxing the assumption that relations are always in First-Normal-Form (1NF) necessitates a reexamination of the fundamentals of relational database theory. In this paper we take a first step towards unifying the various theories of Â¬1NF databases. We start by determining an appropriate model to couch our formalisms in. We then define an extended relational calculus as the theoretical basis for our Â¬1NF database query language. We define a minimal extended relational algebra and prove its equivalence to the Â¬1NF relational calculus. We define a class of Â¬1NF relations with certain â\u20ACœgoodâ\u20AC? properties and extend our algebra operators to work within this domain. We prove certain desirable equivalences that hold only if we restrict our language to this domain."}
