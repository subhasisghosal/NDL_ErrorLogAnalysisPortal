{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24965","fieldValue":" This article reports on the application of a framework used to model, simulate and visualize the 3D structure of astrophysical wind volumes. The modeling methodology is similar to multidirectional medical tomography in that the spatial structure of an extended target can be reconstructed from a sequence of images obtained by scanning that target from several directions. Even though the controlled environment realized in diagnostic radiology cannot be replicated in the study of astrophysical phenomena, strong candidates for astrophysical tomography do exist in hot, close double stars locked in orbits around a common center of mass. As the Keplerian orbit is traced out, the geometry presented to the observer varies so that each star constitutes an analyzer upon its companion's wind and probes its structure. Since these targets are too far to be resolved spatially, we study and model the UV spectral lines of prominent wind ions, which scatter photospheric UV light so that line shapes vary as the stars revolve and as inhomogeneities form, propagate, and evolve in the composite wind. The framework presented is applied to two hot close binaries near the applicability limits of the discussed methodology. Two novel custom-made tools that aid the analysis of the spectra and the visualization of the results are also presented. The first of these, the Spectrum Analyzer and Animator, automates the derivation of light curves from the observed spectra and the generation of synthetic binary wind-line profiles, which reproduce the morphologies and variabilities of the observed wind profiles. After the composite wind structure of a binary has been recovered, the second tool, the Binary 3D Renderer â\u20AC\u201Dalso authored in IDLâ\u20AC\u201Daids the visualization of the results by simulating the motion of the system (stars, winds and wind-interaction effects) around the binary's center of mass. The Binary 3D Renderer thus repackages the end product of a lengthy physical modeling process to generate physically sound, realistic multimedia content and increase the effectiveness and communication impact of the research results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24965","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24965","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24966","fieldValue":" A methodology for efficient tolerance analysis of electronic circuits based on nonsampling stochastic simulation of transients is formulated, implemented, and validated. We model the stochastic behavior of all quantities that are subject to tolerance spectrally with polynomial chaos. A library of stochastic models of linear and nonlinear circuit elements is created. In analogy to the deterministic implementation of the SPICE electronic circuit simulator, the overall stochastic circuit model is obtained using nodal analysis. In the proposed case studies, we analyze the influence of device tolerance on the response of a lowpass filter, the impact of temperature variability on the output of an amplifier, and the effect of changes of the load of a diode bridge on the probability density function of the output voltage. The case studies demonstrate that the novel methodology is computationally faster than the Monte Carlo method and more accurate and flexible than the root-sum-square method. This makes the stochastic circuit simulator, referred to as PolySPICE, a compelling candidate for the tolerance study of reliability-critical electronic circuits."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24966","fieldValue":"SPICE"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24966","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24966","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24967","fieldValue":" A new algorithm is proposed for generating approximate bivariate gamma random samples with a prespecified correlation coefficient and different marginal shapes. A distinctive feature of this approach is computational simplicity and ease of control. Extensive testing demonstrates high accuracy of the proposed algorithm. An S-PLUS code implementing the algorithm is provided. Regression lines produced by the technique are nearly linear, even when marginal shapes are drastically different. This feature makes the approach especially useful in simulation studies associated with linear regression problems. A real-life example of application to the analysis of heteroscedastic regression models is presented. This analysis is a part of a bigger study aimed at quantification of risk factors in cancer research. Two-dimensional probabilistic patterns produced by the algorithm are compared to those generated by the well-known technique by Schmeiser and Lal [1982]."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24967","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24967","fieldValue":"ACM"}
