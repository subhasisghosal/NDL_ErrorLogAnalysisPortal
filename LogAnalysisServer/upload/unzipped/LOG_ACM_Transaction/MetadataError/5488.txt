With the help of the popular software SplitsTree4, we start by approximating the distance matrix with a distance metric that is a linear combination of circular splits. The main results of this paper are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a network with a single face. We show how such a network can be constructed, and we present a heuristic for constructing a network with few faces using the first algorithm as the base case. Experimental results on biological data show that this heuristic algorithm can produce phylogenetic networks with far fewer faces than the ones computed by SplitsTree4, without affecting the approximation of the distance matrix."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4738","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4739","fieldValue":"Wang, Biing-Feng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4739","fieldValue":" The focus of this paper is the problem of finding all nested common intervals of two general sequences. Depending on the treatment one wants to apply to duplicate genes, Blin et al. introduced three models to define nested common intervals of two sequences: the uniqueness, the free-inclusion, and the bijection models. We consider all the three models. For the uniqueness and the bijection models, we give O(n + N_{\\rm out})-time algorithms, where N_{\\rm out} denotes the size of the output. For the free-inclusion model, we give an O(n^{1 + \\varepsilon } + N_{{\\rm out}})-time algorithm, where \\varepsilon > 0 is an arbitrarily small constant. We also present an upper bound on the size of the output for each model. For the uniqueness and the free-inclusion models, we show that N_{\\rm out}=O(n^{2}). Let C = \\sum _{g \\in \\Gamma } o_{1}(g)o_{2}(g), where \\Gamma is the set of distinct genes, and o_{1}(g) and o_{2}(g) are, respectively, the numbers of copies of g in the two given sequences. For the bijection model, we show that N_{\\rm out}=O(Cn). In this paper, we also study the problem of finding all approximate nested common intervals of two sequences on the bijection model. An O(\\delta n + N_{{\\rm out}})-time algorithm is presented, where \\delta denotes the maximum number of allowed gaps. In addition, we show that for this problem N_{\\rm out} is O(\\delta n^{3})."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4739","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4739","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4739","fieldValue":"ACM"}
