{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2244","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of selecting a low-cost s - t path in a graph where the edge costs are a secret, known only to the various economic agents who own them. To solve this problem, Nisan and Ronen applied the celebrated Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which pays a premium to induce the edges so as to reveal their costs truthfully. We observe that this premium can be unacceptably high. There are simple instances where the mechanism pays Î˜(n) times the actual cost of the path, even if there is an alternate path available that costs only (1 &plus; &epsi;) times as much. This inspires the frugal path problem, which is to design a mechanism that selects a path and induces truthful cost revelation, without paying such a high premium. This article contributes negative results on the frugal path problem. On two large classes of graphs, including those having three node-disjoint s - t paths, we prove that no reasonable mechanism can always avoid paying a high premium to induce truthtelling. In particular, we introduce a general class of min function mechanisms, and show that all min function mechanisms can be forced to overpay just as badly as VCG. Meanwhile, we prove that every truthful mechanism satisfying some reasonable properties is a min function mechanism. Our results generalize to the problem of hiring a team to complete a task, where the analog of a path in the graph is a subset of the agents constituting a team capable of completing the task."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2244","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13065","fieldValue":" Field programmable dual-Vdd interconnects are effective in reducing FPGA power. We formulate the dual-Vdd-aware slack budgeting problem as a linear program (LP) and a min-cost network flow problem, respectively. Both algorithms reduce interconnect power by 50&percnt; on average compared to single-Vdd interconnects, but the network-flow-based algorithm runs 11x faster on MCNC benchmarks. Furthermore, we develop simultaneous retiming and slack budgeting (SRSB) with flip-flop layout constraints in dual-Vdd FPGAs based on mixed integer linear programming, and speed-up the algorithm by LP relaxation and local legalization. Compared to retiming followed by slack budgeting, SRSB reduces interconnect power by up to 28.8&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13065","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13065","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13066","fieldValue":" In this article we focus on multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) architectures for human heart electrocardiogram (ECG) real time analysis as a hardware\/software (HW\/SW) platform offering an advance relative to state-of-the-art solutions. This is a relevant biomedical application with good potential market, since heart diseases are responsible for the largest number of yearly deaths. Hence, it is a good target for an application-specific system-on-chip (SoC) and HW\/SW codesign. We investigate a symmetric multiprocessor architecture based on STMicroelectronics VLIW DSPs that process in real time 12-lead ECG signals. This architecture improves upon state-of-the-art SoC designs for ECG analysis in its ability to analyze the full 12 leads in real time, even with high sampling frequencies, and its ability to detect heart malfunction for the whole ECG signal interval. We explore the design space by considering a number of hardware and software architectural options. Comparing our design with present-day solutions from an SoC and application point-of-view shows that our platform can be used in real time and without failures."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13066","fieldValue":"A multiprocessor system-on-chip for real-time biomedical monitoring and analysis: ECG prototype architectural design space exploration"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13066","fieldValue":"ACM"}
