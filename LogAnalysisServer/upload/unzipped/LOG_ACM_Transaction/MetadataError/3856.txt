{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22383","fieldValue":" The phishing scam and its variants are estimated to cost victims billions of dollars per year. Researchers have responded with a number of anti-phishing systems, based either on blacklists or on heuristics. The former cannot cope with the churn of phishing sites, while the latter usually employ decision rules that are not congruent to human perception. We propose a novel heuristic anti-phishing system that explicitly employs gestalt and decision theory concepts to model perceptual similarity. Our system is evaluated on three corpora contrasting legitimate Web sites with real-world phishing scams. The proposed systemâ\u20AC™s performance was equal or superior to current best-of-breed systems. We further analyze current anti-phishing warnings from the perspective of warning theory, and propose a new warning design employing our Gestalt approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22383","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22383","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22384","fieldValue":" We introduce a new methodology for formulating, analyzing, and applying access-control policies. Policies are expressed as formal theories in the SMT (satisfiability-modulo-theories) subset of typed first-order logic, and represented in a programmable logical framework, with each theory extending a core ontology of access control. We reduce both request evaluation and policy analysis to SMT solving, and provide experimental results demonstrating the practicality of these reductions. We also introduce a class of canonical requests and prove that such requests can be evaluated in linear time. In many application domains, access requests are either naturally canonical or can easily be put into canonical form. The resulting policy framework is more expressive than XACML and languages in the Datalog family, without compromising efficiency. Using the computational logic facilities of the framework, a wide range of sophisticated policy analyses (including consistency, coverage, observational equivalence, and change impact) receive succinct formulations whose correctness can be straightforwardly verified. The use of SMT solving allows us to efficiently analyze policies with complicated numeric (integer and real) constraints, a weak point of previous policy analysis systems. Further, by leveraging the programmability of the underlying logical framework, our system provides exceptionally flexible ways of resolving conflicts and composing policies. Specifically, we show that our system subsumes FIA (Fine-grained Integration Algebra), an algebra recently developed for the purpose of integrating complex policies."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22384","fieldValue":"SMT"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22384","fieldValue":"XACML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22384","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22385","fieldValue":" (U.S.) Rule-based policies for mitigating software risk suggest using the CVSS score to measure the risk of an individual vulnerability and act accordingly. A key issue is whether the â\u20AC˜dangerâ\u20AC™ score does actually match the risk of exploitation in the wild, and if and how such a score could be improved. To address this question, we propose using a case-control study methodology similar to the procedure used to link lung cancer and smoking in the 1950s. A case-control study allows the researcher to draw conclusions on the relation between some risk factor (e.g., smoking) and an effect (e.g., cancer) by looking backward at the cases (e.g., patients) and comparing them with controls (e.g., randomly selected patients with similar characteristics). The methodology allows us to quantify the risk reduction achievable by acting on the risk factor. We illustrate the methodology by using publicly available data on vulnerabilities, exploits, and exploits in the wild to (1) evaluate the performances of the current risk factor in the industry, the CVSS base score; (2) determine whether it can be improved by considering additional factors such the existence of a proof-of-concept exploit, or of an exploit in the black markets. Our analysis reveals that (a) fixing a vulnerability just because it was assigned a high CVSS score is equivalent to randomly picking vulnerabilities to fix; (b) the existence of proof-of-concept exploits is a significantly better risk factor; (c) fixing in response to exploit presence in black markets yields the largest risk reduction."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22385","fieldValue":"CVSS"}
