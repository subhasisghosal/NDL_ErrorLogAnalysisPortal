{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9726","fieldValue":" In conventional (noncooperative) automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols for radio networks, the corrupted data frames that cannot be correctly decoded at the destination are retransmitted by the source. In cooperative ARQ protocols, data frame retransmissions may be performed by a neighboring node (the relay) that has successfully overheard the source's frame transmission. One advantage of the latter group of ARQ protocols is the spatial diversity provided by the relay. The first delay model for cooperative ARQ protocols is derived in this paper. The model is analytically derived for a simple set of retransmission rules that make use of both uncoded and coded cooperative communications in slotted radio networks. The model estimates the delay experienced by Poisson arriving frames, whose retransmissions (when required) are performed also by a single relay. Saturation throughput, data frame latency, and buffer occupancy at both the source and relay are quantified and compared against two noncooperative ARQ protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9726","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9726","fieldValue":"Delay models of single-source single-relay cooperative ARQ protocols in slotted radio networks with Poisson frame arrivals"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9726","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9726","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9727","fieldValue":" In wireless networks, users are typically coupled by interference. Hence, resource allocation can strongly depend on receive strategies, such as beamforming, CDMA receivers, etc. We study the problem of minimizing the total transmission power while maintaining individual quality-of-service (QoS) values for all users. This problem can be solved by the fixed-point iteration proposed by Yates (1995) as well as by a recently proposed matrix-based iteration (Schubert and Boche, 2007). It was observed by numerical simulations that the matrix-based iteration has interesting numerical properties, and achieves the global optimum in only a few steps. However, an analytical investigation of the convergence behavior has been an open problem so far. In this paper, we show that the matrix-based iteration can be reformulated as a Newton-type iteration of a convex function, which is not guaranteed to be continuously differentiable. Such a behavior can be caused by ambiguous representations of the interference functions, depending on the choice of the receive strategy. Nevertheless, superlinear convergence can be shown by exploiting the special structure of the problem. Namely, the function is convex, locally Lipschitz continuous, and an invertible directional derivative exists for all points of interest."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9727","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9727","fieldValue":"A superlinearly and globally convergent algorithm for power control and resource allocation with general interference functions"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9727","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9727","fieldValue":"ACM"}
