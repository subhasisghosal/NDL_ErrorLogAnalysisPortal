In this paper, we study Critical Link Disruptor (CLD) and Critical Node Disruptor (CND) optimization problems to identify critical links and nodes in a network whose removals maximally destroy the network's functions. We provide a comprehensive complexity analysis of CLD and CND on general graphs and show that they still remain NP-complete even on unit disk graphs and power-law graphs. Furthermore, the CND problem is shown NP-hard to be approximated within Ω $(n-k\/n^ε$) on general graphs with n vertices and k critical nodes. Despite the intractability of these problems, we propose HILPR, a novel LP-based rounding algorithm, for efficiently solving CLD and CND problems in a timely manner. The effectiveness of our solutions is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10473","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10473","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10473","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10474","fieldValue":"Moazzez-Estanjini, Reza"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10474","fieldValue":" Message ferrying has been shown to be an effective approach to support routing in sparse ad hoc or sensor networks. Considering a generic network model where each node in the network wishes to send data to some (or possibly all) other nodes with known (and possibly different) rates, we propose three schemes enabling multiple ferries to coordinate in collecting and delivering the data. We analyze the performance of each scheme and establish bounds on the average and worst-case delay. The latter bounds are useful in offering performance guarantees. We establish that under one of our schemes, constant per-node throughput is achievable within constant maximum (worst-case) delay as the network size grows. Using simulation, we compare our proposed schemes with an alternative, the Ferry Relaying algorithm proposed earlier in the literature. The results show that our schemes perform better and provide guidance on which scheme to use given performance preferences and the number of available ferries."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10474","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10474","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10474","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10475","fieldValue":" The network infrastructure of Internet service providers (ISPs) undergoes constant evolution. Whenever new requirements arise (e.g., the deployment of a new Point of Presence or a change in the business relationship with a neighboring ISP), operators need to change the configuration of the network. Due to the complexity of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and the lack of methodologies and tools, maintaining service availability during reconfigurations that involve BGP is a challenge for operators. In this paper, we show that the current best practices to reconfigure BGP do not provide guarantees with respect to traffic disruptions. Then, we study the problem of finding an operational ordering of BGP reconfiguration steps that guarantees no packet loss. Unfortunately, finding such an operational ordering, when it exists, is computationally hard. To enable lossless reconfigurations, we propose a framework that extends current features of carrier-grade routers to run two BGP control planes in parallel. We present a prototype implementation and show the effectiveness of our framework through a case study."}
