Conventional proposals have already scheduled the discrete point sampling tasks to decrease the amount of sampled data. However, less effort has been expended for applications that generate continuous interval sampling tasks. Moreover, most pioneering work limits its view to schedule sampling intervals of tasks on a single sensor node and neglects the process of task allocation in WSNs. Therefore, the gained efforts in prior work cannot benefit a large-scale WSN because the performance of a scheduling method is sensitive to the strategy of task allocation. Broadening the scope to an entire network, this article is the first work to maximize data sharing among continuous interval sampling tasks by jointly optimizing task allocation and scheduling of sampling intervals in WSNs. First, we formalize the joint optimization problem and prove it NP-hard. Second, we present the COMBINE operation, which is the crucial ingredient of our solution. COMBINE is a 2-factor approximate algorithm for maximizing data sharing among overlapping tasks. Furthermore, our heuristic named CATS is proposed. CATS is 2-factor approximate algorithm for jointly allocating tasks and scheduling sampling intervals so as to maximize data sharing in the entire network. Extensive empirical study is conducted on a testbed of 50 sensor nodes to evaluate the effectiveness of our methods. In addition, the scalability of our methods is verified by utilizing TOSSIM, a widely used simulation tool. The experimental results indicate that our methods successfully reduce the volume of sampled data and decrease energy consumption significantly."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21625","fieldValue":"CATS: Cooperative Allocation of Tasks and Scheduling of Sampling Intervals for Maximizing Data Sharing in WSNs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21625","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21625","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21626","fieldValue":"Lui, John C S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21626","fieldValue":" In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a space filling curve (SFC) refers to a path passing through all nodes in the network, with each node visited at least once. By enforcing a linear order of the sensor nodes through an SFC, many applications in WSNs concerning serial operations on both sensor nodes and sensor data can be performed, with examples including serial data fusion and path planning of mobile nodes. Although a few studies have made efforts to find such SFCs in WSNs, they primarily target 2D planar or 3D surface settings and cannot be directly applied to 3D volumetric WSNs due to considerably more complex geometric features and topology shapes that the 3D volumetric settings introduce. This article presents BLOW-UP, a distributed, scalable, and connectivity-based algorithm to construct an SFC for a 3D volumetric WSN (or alternatively to linearize the 3D volumetric network). The main idea of BLOW-UP is to decompose the given 3D volumetric network into a series of connected and closed layers, and the nodes are traversed layer by layer, incrementally from the innermost to the outermost, yielding an SFC covering the entire network, provably at least once and at most a constant number of times. To the best of our knowledge, BLOW-UP is the first algorithm that realizes linearization in 3D volumetric WSNs. It does not require advance knowledge of location or distance information. It is also scalable with a nearly constant per-node storage cost and message cost. Extensive simulations under various networks demonstrate its effectiveness on nodesâ\u20AC™ covered times, coverage rate, and covering speed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21626","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21627","fieldValue":" Traditional tracking solutions in wireless sensor networks based on fixed sensors have several critical problems. First, due to the mobility of targets, a lot of sensors have to keep being active to track targets in all potential directions, which causes excessive energy consumption. Second, when there are holes in the deployment area, targets may fail to be detected when moving into holes. Third, when targets stay at certain positions for a long time, sensors surrounding them have to suffer heavier work pressure than do others, which leads to a bottleneck for the entire network. To solve these problems, a few mobile sensors are introduced to follow targets directly for tracking because the energy capacity of mobile sensors is less constrained and they can detect targets closely with high tracking quality. Based on a realistic detection model, a solution of scheduling mobile sensors and fixed sensors for target tracking is proposed. Moreover, the movement path of mobile sensors has a provable performance bound compared to the optimal solution. Results of extensive simulations show that mobile sensors can improve tracking quality even if holes exist in the area and can reduce energy consumption of sensors effectively."}
