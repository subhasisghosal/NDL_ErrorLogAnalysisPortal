Due to the occurrence of such behavior, there may be temporary loss of connectivity between among the nodes. Such a phenomenon is different from the commonly known node isolation problem in stationary WSNs. The mere activation of intermediate sleep nodes cannot guarantee reestablishment of connectivity, because there may not exist neighbor nodes of the isolated nodes. On the contrary, the increase in communication range of a single sensor node may make it die quickly. Including this, a sensor node has maximum limit of increase in communication range that may not be sufficient to reestablish connectivity. Therefore, considering all these factors for self-organization of the network and isolated node re-connection, we propose a price-based scheme, which addresses the issue by activating intermediate sleep nodes or by adjusting the communication range of some of the other nodes in the network. The scheme also deactivates the additional activated nodes and reduces the increased communication range when the dumb nodes resume their normal behavior, upon the return of favorable environmental conditions. To implement the proposed scheme, CoRAD it is required to construct the network using GPS-enabled adjustable communication range sensor nodes. Through simulation we compare our proposed scheme with the existing topology management schemes -- LETC and A1 -- in the same scenario by considering the number of activated nodes, message overhead, and energy consumption. We find that the proposed scheme shows improved performance compared to the existing topology management schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4400","fieldValue":" Covarion models of character evolution describe inhomogeneities in substitution processes through time. In phylogenetics, such models are used to describe changing functional constraints or selection regimes during the evolution of biological sequences. In this work the identifiability of such models for generic parameters on a known phylogenetic tree is established, provided the number of covarion classes does not exceed the size of the observable state space. `Generic parameters' as used here means all parameters except possibly those in a set of measure zero within the parameter space. Combined with earlier results, this implies both the tree and generic numerical parameters are identifiable if the number of classes is strictly smaller than the number of observable states."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4400","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4400","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4401","fieldValue":" Phylogenetic invariants are not the only constraints on site-pattern frequency vectors for phylogenetic trees. A mutation matrix, by its definition, is the exponential of a matrix with non-negative off-diagonal entries; this positivity requirement implies non-trivial constraints on the site-pattern frequency vectors. We call these additional constraints \"edge-parameter inequalities.\" In this paper, we first motivate the edge-parameter inequalities by considering a pathological site-pattern frequency vector corresponding to a quartet tree with a negative internal edge. This site-pattern frequency vector nevertheless satisfies all of the constraints described up to now in the literature. We next describe two complete sets of edge-parameter inequalities for the group-based models; these constraints are square-free monomial inequalities in the Fourier transformed coordinates. These inequalities, along with the phylogenetic invariants, form a complete description of the set of site-pattern frequency vectors corresponding to \\emph{bona fide} trees. Said in mathematical language, this paper explicitly presents two finite lists of inequalities in Fourier coordinates of the form \"monomial $\\leq 1$,\" each list characterizing the phylogenetically relevant semialgebraic subsets of the phylogenetic varieties."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4401","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
