However, there have not been enough scientific and quantitative studies to elucidate how social communication may deliver physical activity interventions. In this work, we introduce a novel model named Topic-aware Community-level Physical Activity Propagation with Temporal Dynamics (TCPT) to analyze physical activity propagation and social influence at different granularities (i.e., individual level and community level). Given a social network, the TCPT model first integrates the correlations between the content of social communication, social influences, and temporal dynamics. Then, a hierarchical approach is utilized to detect a set of communities and their reciprocal influence strength of physical activities. The experimental evaluation shows not only the effectiveness of our approach but also the correlation of the detected communities with various health outcome measures. Our promising results pave a way for knowledge discovery in health social networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7737","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a distributed algorithm for allocating resources to tasks in multiagent systems, one that adapts well to dynamic task arrivals where new work arises at short notice. Our algorithm is designed to leverage preemption if it is available, revoking resource allocations to tasks in progress if new opportunities arise that those resources are better suited to handle. Our multiagent model assigns a task agent to each task that must be completed and a proxy agent to each resource that is available. Preemption occurs when a task agent approaches a proxy agent with a sufficiently compelling need that the proxy agent determines the newcomer derives more benefit from the proxy agentâ\u20AC™s resource than the task agent currently using that resource. Task agents reason about which resources to request based on a learning of churn and congestion. We compare to a well-established multiagent resource allocation framework that permits preemption under more conservative assumptions and show through simulation that our model allows for improved allocations through more permissive preemption. In all, we offer a novel approach for multiagent resource allocation that is able to cope well with dynamic task arrivals."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7738","fieldValue":" An important component of the cyber-defense mechanism is the adequate staffing levels of its cybersecurity analyst workforce and their optimal assignment to sensors for investigating the dynamic alert traffic. The ever-increasing cybersecurity threats faced by todayâ\u20AC™s digital systems require a strong cyber-defense mechanism that is both reactive in its response to mitigate the known risk and proactive in being prepared for handling the unknown risks. In order to be proactive for handling the unknown risks, the above workforce must be scheduled dynamically so the system is adaptive to meet the day-to-day stochastic demands on its workforce (both size and expertise mix). The stochastic demands on the workforce stem from the varying alert generation and their significance rate, which causes an uncertainty for the cybersecurity analyst scheduler that is attempting to schedule analysts for work and allocate sensors to analysts. Sensor data are analyzed by automatic processing systems, and alerts are generated. A portion of these alerts is categorized to be significant, which requires thorough examination by a cybersecurity analyst. Risk, in this article, is defined as the percentage of significant alerts that are not thoroughly analyzed by analysts. In order to minimize risk, it is imperative that the cyber-defense system accurately estimates the future significant alert generation rate and dynamically schedules its workforce to meet the stochastic workload demand to analyze them. The article presents a reinforcement learning-based stochastic dynamic programming optimization model that incorporates the above estimates of future alert rates and responds by dynamically scheduling cybersecurity analysts to minimize risk (i.e., maximize significant alert coverage by analysts) and maintain the risk under a pre-determined upper bound. The article tests the dynamic optimization model and compares the results to an integer programming model that optimizes the static staffing needs based on a daily-average alert generation rate with no estimation of future alert rates (static workforce model). Results indicate that over a finite planning horizon, the learning-based optimization model, through a dynamic (on-call) workforce in addition to the static workforce, (a) is capable of balancing risk between days and reducing overall risk better than the static model, (b) is scalable and capable of identifying the quantity and the right mix of analyst expertise in an organization, and (c) is able to determine their dynamic (on-call) schedule and their sensor-to-analyst allocation in order to maintain risk below a given upper bound. Several meta-principles are presented, which are derived from the optimization model, and they further serve as guiding principles for hiring and scheduling cybersecurity analysts. Days-off scheduling was performed to determine analyst weekly work schedules that met the cybersecurity systemâ\u20AC™s workforce constraints and requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7738","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7738","fieldValue":"ACM"}
