{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3632","fieldValue":" This paper proposes a real-time acoustic channel equalization method that uses an adaptive multichannel linear prediction technique. In general, multichannel equalization algorithms can eliminate reverberation if they meet the following specific conditions including: the co-primeness between channels and sufficient filter length. It also requires the characteristic of correct channel information, however, it is difficult to estimate accurate acoustic channels in a practical system. The proposed method utilizes a theoretically perfect channel equalization algorithm and considers problems that may arise in the actual system. Linear-predictive multi-input equalization (LIME) is also an appropriate attempt at blind dereverberation by assuring the theoretical basis. However, a huge computational cost is incurred by calculating the large dimensions of a covariance matrix and its inversion. The proposed equalizer is developed as a multichannel linear prediction (MLP) oriented structure with a new formula that is optimized to time-varying acoustical room environments. Moreover, experimental results show that the proposed method works well even if the channel characteristics of each microphone are similar. The results of experiments using various room impulse response (RIR) models, including both the synthesized and real room environments, show that the proposed method is superior to conventional methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3632","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3632","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3633","fieldValue":" We tackle the speech separation problem through modeling the acoustics of the reverberant chambers. Our approach exploits structured sparsity models to perform speech recovery and room acoustic modeling from recordings of concurrent unknown sources. The speakers are assumed to lie on a two-dimensional plane and the multipath channel is characterized using the image model. We propose an algorithm for room geometry estimation relying on localization of the early images of the speakers by sparse approximation of the spatial spectrum of the virtual sources in a free-space model. The images are then clustered exploiting the low-rank structure of the spectro-temporal components belonging to each source. This enables us to identify the early support of the room impulse response function and its unique map to the room geometry. To further tackle the ambiguity of the reflection ratios, we propose a novel formulation of the reverberation model and estimate the absorption coefficients through a convex optimization exploiting joint sparsity model formulated upon spatio-spectral sparsity of concurrent speech representation. The acoustic parameters are then incorporated for separating individual speech signals through either structured sparse recovery or inverse filtering the acoustic channels. The experiments conducted on real data recordings of spatially stationary sources demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for speech separation and recognition."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3633","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3633","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3634","fieldValue":"Khong, Andy W H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3634","fieldValue":" Equalization of acoustic channels usually involves inversion of acoustic impulse responses (AIRs), and generally employs multichannel techniques. In this paper, we propose three equalization algorithms, one in the Karhunen-Lo√®ve transform (KLT) domain and the other two in the frequency domain. Our proposed algorithm in the KLT domain provides a platform to achieve equalization in conjunction with denoising. Existing multiple-input\/output inverse theorem (MINT)-based non-adaptive algorithms require the inversion of a matrix with dimension that is proportional to the AIR length, and is computationally expensive. To overcome this limitation, we propose the frequency-domain algorithm which is computationally very efficient and thus can be employed for the equalization of high-order AIRs in practical applications. In addition, the frequency-domain method is more robust to AIR estimation errors. To achieve further reduction in the complexity without significant performance degradation, we then propose a modified version of the frequency-domain algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3634","fieldValue":"Multichannel Equalization in the KLT and Frequency Domains With Application to Speech Dereverberation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3634","fieldValue":"ACM"}
