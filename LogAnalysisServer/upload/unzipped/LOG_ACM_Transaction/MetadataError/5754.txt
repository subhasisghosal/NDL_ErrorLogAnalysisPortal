The second heart sound includes aortic (A2) and pulmonic (P2) closure sounds. However, the split detection is obscured due to A2-P2 overlap and low energy of P2. To identify such split, HVD method is used to decompose the S2 into a number of components while preserving the phase information. Further, A2s and P2s are localized using smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution followed by reassignment method. Finally, the split is calculated by taking the differences between the means of time indices of A2s and P2s. Experiments on total 33 clips of S2 signals are performed for evaluation of the method. The mean Â± standard deviation of the split is 34.7 Â± 4.6 ms. The method measures the split efficiently, even when A2-P2 overlap is â\u2030¤ 20 ms and the normalized peak temporal ratio of P2 to A2 is low (â\u2030¥ 0.22). This proposed method thus, demonstrates its robustness by defining split detectability (SDT), the split detection aptness through detecting P2s, by measuring upto 96 percent. Such findings reveal the effectiveness of the method as competent against the other baselines, especially for A2-P2 overlaps and low energy P2."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5217","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5217","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5217","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5218","fieldValue":"Hasanzadeh, Reza P R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5218","fieldValue":" Post-acquisition denoising of magnetic resonance (MR) images is an important step to improve any quantitative measurement of the acquired data. In this paper, assuming a Rician noise model, a new filtering method based on the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation is introduced, which employs the self-similarity property of the MR data to restore the noise-less signal. This method takes into account the structural characteristics of images and the Bayesian mean square error (Bmse) of the estimator to address the denoising problem. In general, a twofold data processing approach is developed; first, the noisy MR data is processed using a patch-based $L^2$-norm similarity measure to provide the primary set of samples required for the estimation process. Afterwards, the Bmse of the estimator is derived as the optimization function to analyze the pre-selected samples and minimize the error between the estimated and the underlying signal. Compared to the LMMSE method and also its recently proposed SNR-adapted realization (SNLMMSE), the optimized way of choosing the samples together with the automatic adjustment of the filtering parameters lead to a more robust estimation performance with our approach. Experimental results show the competitive performance of the proposed method in comparison with related state-of-the-art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5218","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5218","fieldValue":"MRI"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5218","fieldValue":"ACM"}
