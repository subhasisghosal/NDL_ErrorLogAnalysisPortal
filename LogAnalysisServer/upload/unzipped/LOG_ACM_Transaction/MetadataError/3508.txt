{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21443","fieldValue":" Data collection is a common operation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The performance of data collection can be measured by its achievable network capacity. However, most existing works focus on the network capacity of unicast, multicast or\/and broadcast. In this article, we study the snapshot\/continuous data collection (SDC\/CDC) problem under the physical interference model for randomly deployed dense WSNs. For SDC, we propose a Cell-Based Path Scheduling (CBPS) algorithm based on network partitioning. Theoretical analysis shows that its achievable network capacity is order-optimal. For CDC, a novel Segment-Based Pipeline Scheduling (SBPS) algorithm is proposed which combines the pipeline technique and the compressive data gathering technique. Theoretical analysis shows that SBPS significantly speeds up the CDC process and achieves a high network capacity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21443","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21443","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21444","fieldValue":" The increasing use of sensor-derived information from planned, ad-hoc, and\/or opportunistically deployed sensor networks provides enhanced visibility to everyday activities and processes, enabling fast-paced data-to-decision in personal, social, civilian, military, and business contexts. The value that information brings to this visibility and ensuing decisions depends on the quality characteristics of the information gathered. In this article, we highlight, refine, and extend upon our past work in the areas of quality and value of information (QoI and VoI) for sensor networks. Specifically, we present and elaborate on our two-layer QoI\/VoI definition, where the former relates to context-independent aspects and the latter to context-dependent aspects of an information product. Then, we refine our taxonomy of pertinent QoI and VoI attributes anchored around a simple ontological relationship between the two. Finally, we introduce a framework for scoring and ranking information products based on their VoI attributes using the analytic hierarchy multicriteria decision process, illustrated via a simple example."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21444","fieldValue":"AHP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21444","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21444","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21445","fieldValue":"Fu, Huai-Lei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21445","fieldValue":"Wang, Ting-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21445","fieldValue":" Mobile sensor networks (MSNs) have been widely deployed to provide a ubiquitous solution to real-time monitoring applications such as traffic data collection in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), ocean data collection in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs), and biodata collection in wireless body area networks (WBANs). One major issue for designing MSNs is the energy-validity trade-off, that is, the trade-off between the energy efficiency for mobile sensors (MSs) and the validity of sensing reports. In this article, we propose a novel mechanism, Energy-Efficient Distributedly Controlled Reporting $(E^2DCR), to mitigate the energy consumption for MSs in real-time monitoring applications while keeping the sensing report valid. In this mechanism, we design dynamic sleeping adjustment (DSA) algorithms to adjust an MS's sleeping period using a heuristic method to reduce energy consumption. We provide analytical models to evaluate the performance of E2DCR in terms of the power savings and report validity. It has been shown that with E2$DCR, MSs can report with less energy consumption while satisfying delay constraints for real-time monitoring applications."}
