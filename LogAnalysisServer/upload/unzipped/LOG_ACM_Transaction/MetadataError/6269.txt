It would be useful to measure stress for prevention of stress-related health problems. An experiment is described in which EMG signals of the upper trapezius muscle were measured with a wireless system during three different stressful conditions: a calculation task (the Norinder test), a logical puzzle task and a memory task. The latter two tests were newly designed and aimed at creating circumstances that are similar to work stress. Amplitudes of the EMG signals were significantly higher during stress compared to rest (&plus;2.6&percnt; of reference contraction level) and relative time with EMG gaps was lower during stress (âˆ\u201914.3&percnt; of time). Also, mean and median frequencies were significantly lower during stress than during rest (âˆ\u20198.6 and âˆ\u20198.8 Hz, respectively). EMG amplitude increased not only from rest to stress conditions, but also during stressful conditions and decreased during relaxation periods. EMG features correlated with subjectively indicated stress levels (correlations of 0.32 with RMS and âˆ\u20190.32 with relative gaptime). The results indicate that EMG is a useful parameter to detect stress. Together with other physiological sensors, EMG sensors can be included in a wireless system for ambulatory monitoring of stress levels."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6695","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6696","fieldValue":"Wan, Chieh-Yih"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6696","fieldValue":" In emergency medicine, patient care is intense and stressful, often requiring paramedics to consult with remote physicians to convey the patient's condition. We present a framework for context-management in telemedicine developed in collaboration between engineers, physicians, and paramedics. We describe a mobile platform and embedded wireless sensors to capture physiological and audio context into a comprehensive patient record, accessible locally and remotely. We describe a first evaluation of this technology by trained paramedics in simulated scenarios and evaluate key aspects of system performance. Early results suggest that wireless sensing can provide reliable and low latency data both locally and to remote physicians. In addition, audio context capture is a promising approach to capturing a comprehensive patient record, with a low rate of medically important errors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6696","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6697","fieldValue":" An unsupervised learning algorithm is presented for segmentation and evaluation of motion data from the on-body Orient wireless motion capture system for mobile gait analysis. The algorithm is model-free and operates on the latent space of the motion, by first aggregating all the sensor data into a single vector, and then modeling them on a low-dimensional manifold to perform segmentation. The proposed approach is contrasted to a basic, model-based algorithm, which operates directly on the joint angles computed by the Orient sensor devices. The latent space algorithm is shown to be capable of retrieving qualitative features of the motion even in the face of noisy or incomplete sensor readings."}
