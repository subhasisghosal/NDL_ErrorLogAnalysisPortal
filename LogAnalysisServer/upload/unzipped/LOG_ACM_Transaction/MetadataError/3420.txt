In order to improve the security robustness of random key predistribution and pairwise key establishment schemes against these attacks, we propose a five-phase pairwise key predistribution and pairwise key establishment approach by using area partitioning and multigroup key predistribution. Our security performance studies show that our proposed approach is resilient to selective node capture and node fabrication attacks, and restricts the consequence of any insider attack to a minimal level."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21220","fieldValue":"Secure pairwise key establishment in large-scale sensor networks: An area partitioning and multigroup key predistribution approach"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21220","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21221","fieldValue":" Achieving energy efficiency to prolong the network lifetime is an important design criterion for wireless sensor networks. In this article, we propose a novel approach that exploits the broadcast nature of the wireless medium for energy conservation in spatially correlated wireless sensor networks. Since wireless transmission is inherently broadcast, when one sensor node transmits, other nodes in its coverage area can receive the transmitted data. When data collected by different sensors are correlated, each sensor can utilize the data it overhears from other sensors to compress its own data and conserve energy in its own transmissions. We apply this idea to a class of cluster-based wireless sensor networks in which each sensing node transmits collected data directly to its cluster head using time division multiple access (TDMA). We formulate the problem in which sensors in each cluster collaborate their transmitting, receiving, and compressing activities to optimize their lifetimes. We show that this lifetime optimization problem can be solved by a sequence of linear programming problems. We also propose a heuristic scheme which has low complexity and achieves near optimal performance. Important characteristics of wireless sensor networks such as node startup cost and packet loss due to transmission errors are also considered. Numerical results show that by exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless medium, our control schemes achieve significant improvement in the sensors' lifetimes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21221","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21221","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21222","fieldValue":"Wan, Chieh-Yih"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21222","fieldValue":" There is a critical need for new thinking regarding overload traffic management in sensor networks. It has now become clear that experimental sensor networks (e.g., mote networks) and their applications commonly experience periods of persistent congestion and high packet loss, and in some cases even congestion collapse. This significantly impacts application fidelity measured at the physical sinks, even under light to moderate traffic loads, and is a direct product of the funneling effect; that is, the many-to-one multihop traffic pattern that characterizes sensor network communications. Existing congestion control schemes are effective at mitigating congestion through rate control and packet drop mechanisms, but do so at the cost of significantly reducing application fidelity measured at the sinks. To address this problem we propose to exploit the availability of a small number of all wireless, multiradio virtual sinks that can be randomly distributed or selectively placed across the sensor field. Virtual sinks are capable of siphoning off data events from regions of the sensor field that are beginning to show signs of high traffic load. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Siphon, a set of fully distributed algorithms that support virtual sink discovery and selection, congestion detection, and traffic redirection in sensor networks. Siphon is based on a Stargate implementation of virtual sinks that uses a separate longer range radio network (based on IEEE 802.11) to siphon events to one or more physical sinks, and a short-range mote radio to interact with the sensor field at siphon points. Results from analysis, simulation and an experimental 48 Mica2 mote testbed show that virtual sinks can scale mote networks by effectively managing growing traffic demands while minimizing any negative impact on application fidelity. Additionally, we show the scheme is competitive with respect to energy consumption compared to a network composed of only motes."}
