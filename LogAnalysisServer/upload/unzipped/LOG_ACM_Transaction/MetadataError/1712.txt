To create a plain-weaving on a surface, we need to create cycles that cross other cycles (or themselves) by alternatingly going over and under. We use the fact that it is possible to create such cycles, starting from any given manifold-mesh surface by simply twisting every edge of the manifold mesh. We have developed a new method that converts plain-weaving cycles to 3D thread structures. Using this method, it is possible to cover a surface without large gaps between threads by controlling the sizes of the gaps. We have developed a system that converts any manifold mesh to a plain-woven object, by interactively controlling the shapes of the threads with a set of parameters. We have demonstrated that by using this system, we can create a wide variety of plain-weaving patterns, some of which may not have been seen before."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16116","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16116","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16117","fieldValue":" The ability to interactively edit human motion data is essential for character animation. We present a novel motion editing technique that allows the user to manipulate synchronized multiple character motions interactively. Our Laplacian motion editing method formulates the interaction among multiple characters as a collection of linear constraints and enforces the constraints, while the user directly manipulates the motion of characters in both spatial and temporal domains. Various types of manipulation handles are provided to specify absolute\/relative spatial location, direction, time, duration, and synchronization of multiple characters. The capability of non-sequential discrete editing is incorporated into our motion editing interfaces, so continuous and discrete editing is performed simultaneously and seamlessly. We demonstrate that the synchronized multiple character motions are synthesized and manipulated at interactive rates using spatiotemporal constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16117","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16117","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16118","fieldValue":" We demonstrate a real-time simulation system capable of automatically balancing a standing character, while at the same time tracking a reference motion and responding to external perturbations. The system is general to non-human morphologies and results in natural balancing motions employing the entire body (for example, wind-milling). Our novel balance routine seeks to control the linear and angular momenta of the character. We demonstrate how momentum is related to the center of mass and center of pressure of the character and derive control rules to change these centers for balance. The desired momentum changes are reconciled with the objective of tracking the reference motion through an optimization routine which produces target joint accelerations. A hybrid inverse\/forward dynamics algorithm determines joint torques based on these joint accelerations and the ground reaction forces. Finally, the joint torques are applied to the free-standing character simulation. We demonstrate results for following both motion capture and keyframe data as well as both human and non-human morphologies in presence of a variety of conditions and disturbances."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16118","fieldValue":"ACM"}
