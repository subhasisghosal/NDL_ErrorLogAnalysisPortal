{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9926","fieldValue":" Multi-hop ad hoc networks suffer from the \"hidden\" and \"exposed\" node problems which diminish aggregate network throughput. While there are various approaches to mitigating these problems, in this work we focus exclusively on the role of physical carrier sensing (PCS). Specifically, tuning the PCS threshold leads to a trade-off between the hidden and exposed cases; reducing one typically increases the other, implying the existence of an optimal PCS threshold setting maximizes the aggregate network throughput. The contributions of this work are two-fold: i. We develop an analytical model to determine the optimal PCS threshold for a homogeneous network with constant link distances and show that setting the carrier sensing range close to the interference range is a robust close-to-optimal setting for network optimization in many scenarios. As an extension to more pragmatic network topologies with non-uniform link distances, a rate-to-link allocation scheme is proposed based on rendering the interference range equal for all links that allows a single carrier sense range to be used for the whole network. ii. The above suggests the need for on-line adaptation of tunable PCS threshold in general. The proposed algorithm is based on the key concept of loss differentiation (LD), which disambiguates the cause of packet loss event due to link layer interference (hidden terminals) and collisions respectively. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed PCS adaptations make the PCS threshold converge to its optimal value and thus outperform schemes without PCS adaptation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9926","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9926","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9927","fieldValue":"Hsu, Wei-Jen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9927","fieldValue":" Realistic mobility models are fundamental to evaluate the performance of protocols in mobile ad hoc networks. Unfortunately, there are no mobility models that capture the nonhomogeneous behaviors in both space and time commonly found in reality, while at the same time being easy to use and analyze. Motivated by this, we propose a time-variant community mobility model, referred to as the TVC model, which realistically captures spatial and temporal correlations. We devise the communities that lead to skewed location visiting p, and time periods that allow us to model time dependent behaviors and periodic reappearances of nodes at specific locations. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of the TVC model, we use it to generate synthetic traces that match the characteristics of a number of qualitatively different mobility traces, including wireless LAN traces, vehicular mobility traces, and human encounter traces. More importantly, we show that, despite the high level of realism achieved, our TVC model is still theoretically tractable. To establish this, we derive a number of important quantities related to protocol performance, such as the average node degree, the hitting time, and the meeting time, and provide examples of how to utilize this theory to guide design decisions in routing protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9927","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9928","fieldValue":" Intermeeting time between mobile nodes is one of the key metrics in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) and central to the end-to-end delay of forwarding algorithms. It is typically assumed to be exponentially distributed in many performance studies of MANET or numerically shown to be exponentially distributed under most existing mobility models in the literature. However, recent empirical results show otherwise: The intermeeting time distribution, in fact, follows a power-law. This outright discrepancy potentially undermines our understanding of the performance tradeoffs in MANET obtained under the exponential distribution of the intermeeting time and, thus, calls for further study on the power-law intermeeting time including its fundamental cause, mobility modeling, and its effect. In this paper, we rigorously prove that a finite domain, on which most of the current mobility models are defined, plays an important role in creating the exponential tail of the intermeeting time. We also prove that by simply removing the boundary in a simple two-dimensional isotropic random walk model, we are able to obtain the empirically observed power-law decay of the intermeeting time. We then discuss the relationship between the size of the boundary and the relevant timescale of the network scenario under consideration. Our results thus provide guidelines on the mobility modeling with power-law intermeeting time distribution, new protocols including packet-forwarding algorithms, as well as their performance analysis."}
