{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4526","fieldValue":" Modern biological applications usually involve the similarity comparison between two objects, which is often computationally very expensive, such as whole genome pairwise alignment and protein 3D structure alignment. Nevertheless, being able to quickly identify the closest neighboring objects from very large databases for a newly obtained sequence or structure can provide timely hints to its functions and more. This paper presents a substantial speedup technique for the well-studied k-nearest neighbor (k-nn) search, based on novel concepts of virtual pivots and partial pivots, such that a significant number of the expensive distance computations can be avoided. The new method is able to dynamically locate virtual pivots, according to the query, with increasing pruning ability. Using the same or less amount of database preprocessing effort, the new method outperformed the second best method by using no more than 40 percent distance computations per query, on a database of 10,000 gene sequences, compared to several best known k-nn search methods including M-Tree, OMNI, SA-Tree, and LAESA. We demonstrated the use of this method on two biological sequence data sets, one of which is for HIV-1 viral strain computational genotyping."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4526","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4526","fieldValue":"Nearest neighbor search, metric space, triangle inequality pruning, virtual pivot, partial pivot, HIV-1 computational genotyping."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4527","fieldValue":"Huang, Liang-Tsung"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4527","fieldValue":"Lai, Lien-Fu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4527","fieldValue":" Most of the bioinformatics tools developed for predicting mutant protein stability appear as a black box and the relationship between amino acid sequence\/structure and stability is hidden to the users. We have addressed this problem and developed a human-readable rule generator for integrating the knowledge of amino acid sequence and experimental stability change upon single mutation. Using information about the original residue, substituted residue, and three neighboring residues, classification rules have been generated to discriminate the stabilizing and destabilizing mutants and explore the basis for experimental data. These rules are human readable, and hence, the method enhances the synergy between expert knowledge and computational system. Furthermore, the performance of the rules has been assessed on a nonredundant data set of 1,859 mutants and we obtained an accuracy of 80 percent using cross validation. The results showed that the method could be effectively used as a tool for both knowledge discovery and predicting mutant protein stability.
