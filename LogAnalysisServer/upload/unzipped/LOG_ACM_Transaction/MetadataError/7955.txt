In this article, we present a hardware attack (called MAGIC) to maliciously accelerate NBTI aging effects in cores. In this attack, we identify the input patterns that maliciously age the pipestages of a core. We then craft a program that generates these patterns at the inputs of the targeted pipestage. We demonstrate the MAGIC-based attack on the OpenSPARC processor. Executing this program dramatically accelerates the aging process and degrades the processorâ\u20AC™s performance by 10.92&percnt; in 1 month, bypassing existing aging mitigation and timing-error correction schemes. We also present two low-cost techniques to thwart the proposed attack."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1979","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1979","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10727","fieldValue":" Designing an efficient and scalable packet filter for modern computer networks becomes more challenging each day: Faster link speeds, the steady increase in the number of encapsulation rules (e.g., tunneling), and the necessity to precisely isolate a given subset of traffic cause filtering expressions to become more complex than in the past. Most current packet filtering mechanisms cannot deal with those requirements because their optimization algorithms either cannot scale with the increased size of the filtering code or exploit simple domain-specific optimizations that cannot guarantee to operate properly in case of complex filters. This paper presents pFSA, a new model that transforms packet filters into finite state automata and guarantees the optimal number of checks on the packet, also in case of multiple filters composition, hence enabling efficiency and scalability without sacrificing filtering computation time."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10727","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10727","fieldValue":"PFSA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10727","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10727","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10728","fieldValue":" Wireless secrecy is essential for communication confidentiality, health privacy, public safety, information superiority, and economic advantage in the modern information society. Contemporary security systems are based on cryptographic primitives and can be complemented by techniques that exploit the intrinsic properties of a wireless environment. This paper develops a foundation for design and analysis of wireless networks with secrecy provided by intrinsic properties such as node spatial distribution, wireless propagation medium, and aggregate network interference. We further propose strategies that mitigate eavesdropping capabilities, and we quantify their benefits in terms of network secrecy metrics. This research provides insights into the essence of wireless network intrinsic secrecy and offers a new perspective on the role of network interference in communication confidentiality."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10728","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
