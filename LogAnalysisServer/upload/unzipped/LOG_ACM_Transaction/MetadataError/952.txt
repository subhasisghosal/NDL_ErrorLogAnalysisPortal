Permitting this level of abstraction has the danger, however, that update requests issued by a user within the context of his view may not translate correctly into equivalent updates on the underlying database. The purpose of this paper is to formalize the notion of update translation and derive conditions under which translation procedures will produce correct translations of view updates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2315","fieldValue":" In this article, we study metrics of negative type, which are metrics (V, d) such that &sqrt;d is an Euclidean metric; these metrics are thus also known as $&ell;_2-squared metrics. We show how to embed n-point negative-type metrics into Euclidean space &ell;2 with distortion D &equals; $O(log^3\/4n). This embedding result, in turn, implies an O(log3\/4k)-approximation algorithm for the Sparsest Cut problem with nonuniform demands. Another corollary we obtain is that n-point subsets of &ell;1 embed into &ell;2$ with distortion O(log3\/4$ n)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2315","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2315","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13928","fieldValue":" Semantic networks are so intuitive and easy to use that they are often employed without much thought as to the phenomenon of semantic nets themselves. Since they are becoming more and more a tool of artificial intelligence and now database technology, it is appropriate to focus on the principles of semantic nets. Such focus finds a harmonious and consistent base which can increase the semantic quality and usefulness of such nets. Three rules of representation are presented which achieve greater conceptual simplicity for users, simplifications in semantic net implementations and maintenance, and greater consistency across semantic net applications. These rules, applied to elements of the net itself, reveal how fundamental structures should be organized, and show that the common labeled-edge semantic net can be derived from a more primitive structure involving only nodes and membership relationships (and special nodes which represent names). Also, the correlation between binary and n-ary relations is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13928","fieldValue":"ACM"}
