To identify prominent symmetric regions which overlap and vary in form and scale, we decouple scale extraction and symmetry extraction by performing two levels of clustering. First, significant symmetry scales are identified by clustering sample point pairs from an input shape. Since different point pairs can share a common point, shape regions covered by points in different scale clusters can overlap. We introduce the symmetry scale matrix (SSM), where each entry estimates the likelihood two point pairs belong to symmetries at the same scale. The pair-to-pair symmetry affinity is computed based on a pair signature which encodes scales. We perform spectral clustering using the SSM to obtain the scale clusters. Then for all points belonging to the same scale cluster, we perform the second-level spectral clustering, based on a novel point-to-point symmetry affinity measure, to extract partial symmetries at that scale. We demonstrate our algorithm on complex shapes possessing rich symmetries at multiple scales."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16770","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16770","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16771","fieldValue":"Luo, Sheng-Jie"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16771","fieldValue":"Shen, I-Chao"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16771","fieldValue":"Chen, Bing-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16771","fieldValue":"Cheng, Wen-Huang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16771","fieldValue":"Chuang, Yung-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16771","fieldValue":" This paper presents a novel technique for seamless stereoscopic image cloning, which performs both shape adjustment and color blending such that the stereoscopic composite is seamless in both the perceived depth and color appearance. The core of the proposed method is an iterative disparity adaptation process which alternates between two steps: disparity estimation, which re-estimates the disparities in the gradient domain so that the disparities are continuous across the boundary of the cloned region; and perspective-aware warping, which locally re-adjusts the shape and size of the cloned region according to the estimated disparities. This process guarantees not only depth continuity across the boundary but also models local perspective projection in accordance with the disparities, leading to more natural stereoscopic composites. The proposed method allows for easy cloning of objects with intricate silhouettes and vague boundaries because it does not require precise segmentation of the objects. Several challenging cases are demonstrated to show that our method generates more compelling results compared to methods with only global shape adjustment."}
