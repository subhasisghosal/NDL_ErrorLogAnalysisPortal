These systems often provide the possibility to annotate the content with tags and ratings. Using a random walk through the social annotation graph, we have combined these annotations into a retrieval model that effectively balances the personal preferences and opinions of like-minded users into a single relevance ranking for either content, tags, or people. We use this model to identify the influence of different annotation methods and system design aspects on common ranking tasks in social content systems. Our results show that a combination of rating and tagging information can improve tasks like search and recommendation. The optimal influence of both sources on the ranking is highly dependent on the retrieval task and system design. Results on content search and tag suggestion indicate that the profile created by a user's annotations can be used effectively to adapt the ranking to personal preferences. The random walk reduces sparsity problems by smoothly integrating indirectly related concepts in the relevance ranking, which is especially valuable for cold-start users or individual tagging systems like YouTube and Flickr."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24019","fieldValue":" Recently, video search reranking has been an effective mechanism to improve the initial text-based ranking list by incorporating visual consistency among the result videos. While existing methods attempt to rerank all the individual result videos, they suffer from several drawbacks. In this article, we propose a new video reranking paradigm called cluster-based video reranking (CVR). The idea is to first construct a video near-duplicate graph representing the visual similarity relationship among videos, followed by identifying the near-duplicate clusters from the video near-duplicate graph, then ranking the obtained near-duplicate clusters based on cluster properties and intercluster links, and finally for each ranked cluster, a representative video is selected and returned. Compared to existing methods, the new CVR ranks clusters and exhibits several advantages, including superior reranking by utilizing more reliable cluster properties, fast reranking on a small number of clusters, diverse and representative results. Particularly, we formulate the near-duplicate cluster identification as a novel maximally cohesive subgraph mining problem. By leveraging the designed cluster scoring properties indicating the cluster's importance and quality, random walk is applied over the near-duplicate cluster graph to rank clusters. An extensive evaluation study proves the novelty and superiority of our proposals over existing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24019","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24019","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24020","fieldValue":" Conjunctive Boolean queries are a key component of modern information retrieval systems, especially when Web-scale repositories are being searched. A conjunctive query q is equivalent to a &verbar;q&verbar;-way intersection over ordered sets of integers, where each set represents the documents containing one of the terms, and each integer in each set is an ordinal document identifier. As is the case with many computing applications, there is tension between the way in which the data is represented, and the ways in which it is to be manipulated. In particular, the sets representing index data for typical document collections are highly compressible, but are processed using random access techniques, meaning that methods for carrying out set intersections must be alert to issues to do with access patterns and data representation. Our purpose in this article is to explore these trade-offs, by investigating intersection techniques that make use of both uncompressed â\u20ACœintegerâ\u20AC? representations, as well as compressed arrangements. We also propose a simple hybrid method that provides both compact storage, and also faster intersection computations for conjunctive querying than is possible even with uncompressed representations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24020","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24020","fieldValue":"ACM"}
