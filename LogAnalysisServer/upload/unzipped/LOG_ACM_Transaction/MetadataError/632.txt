A matching is a set of (applicant, post) pairs such that each applicant and each post appears in at most one pair. A rank-maximal matching is one in which the maximum possible number of applicants are matched to their first choice post, and subject to that condition, the maximum possible number are matched to their second choice post, and so on. This is a relevant concept in any practical matching situation and it was first studied by Irving [2003].We give an algorithm to compute a rank-maximal matching with running time O(min(n &plus; C,C &sqrt;n)m), where C is the maximal rank of an edge used in a rank-maximal matching, n is the number of applicants and posts and m is the total size of the preference lists."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2236","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2236","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12981","fieldValue":" Verification and test are critical phases in the development of any hardware or software system. This article focuses on black box testing of the control part of hardware and software systems. Black box testing involves specification, test generation, and fault coverage. Finite state machines (FSMs) are commonly used for specifying controllers. FSMs may have shortcomings in modeling complex systems. With the introduction of X-machines, complex systems can be modeled at higher levels of abstraction. An X-machine can be converted into an FSM while preserving the level of abstraction. The fault coverage of a test sequence for an FSM specification provides a confidence level. We propose a fault coverage metric for an FSM specification based on the transition fault model, and using this metric, we derive the coverage of a test sequence. The article also presents a method which generates short test sequences that meet a specific coverage level and then extends this metric to determine the coverage of a test sequence for an FSM driven by an FSM network. We applied our FSM verification technique to a real-life FSM, namely, the fibre channel arbitrated loop port state machine, used in the field of storage area networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12981","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12982","fieldValue":"Wu, Zhong-Zhen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12982","fieldValue":"Chang, Shih-Chieh"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12982","fieldValue":" Global flow optimization (GFO) can perform multiple fanout\/fanin wire reconnections at a time by modeling the problem of multiple wire reconnections with a flow graph, and then solving the problem using the maxflow-mincut algorithm on the flow graph. In this article, we propose an efficient multiple wire reconnection technique that modifies the framework of GFO, and as a result, can obtain better optimization quality. First, we observe that the flow graph in GFO cannot fully characterize wire reconnections, which causes the GFO to lose optimality in several obvious cases. In addition, we find that fanin reconnection can have more optimization power than fanout reconnection, but requires more sophisticated modeling. We reformulate the problem of fanout\/fanin reconnections by a new graph, called the implication flow graph (IFG). We show that the problem of wire reconnections on the implication flow graph is NP-complete and also propose an efficient heuristic on the new graph. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct an application which utilizes the flexibility of the wire reconnections explored in the logic domain to further minimize interconnects in the physical layout. Our experimental results are very exciting."}
