As new threats and vulnerabilities emerge, ACLs on routers and firewalls are getting larger. Therefore, compressing ACLs is an important problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called Diplomat, to ACL compression. The key idea is to transform higher dimensional target patterns into lower dimensional patterns by dividing the original pattern into a series of hyperplanes and then resolving differences between two adjacent hyperplanes by adding rules that specify the differences. This approach is fundamentally different from prior ACL compression algorithms and is shown to be very effective. We implemented Diplomat and conducted side-by-side comparison with the prior Firewall Compressor, TCAM Razor, and ACL Compressor algorithms on real life classifiers. Our experimental results show that Diplomat outperforms all of them on most of our real-life classifiers, often by a considerable margin, particularly as classifier size and complexity increases. In particular, on our largest ACLs, Diplomat has an average improvement ratio of 34.9% over Firewall Compressor on range-ACLs, of 14.1% over TCAM Razor on prefix-ACLs, and 8.9% over ACL Compressor on mixed-ACLs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10892","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10892","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10892","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10893","fieldValue":" In this paper, we consider last level cache (LLC) sharing problems in large-scale cloud networks with a fair payoff function. We formulate the problem as a strategic decision-making problem (i.e., a game). We examine the resource-sharing game with finite and infinite number of players. Exploiting the aggregate structure of the payoff functions, we show that the resource-sharing game has a Nash equilibrium in a wide range of return index. We show that the Nash equilibrium is not an evolutionarily stable strategy in the finite regime. Then, we introduce a myopic mean-field response where each player implements a mean-field-taking strategy. We show that such a mean-field-taking strategy is an evolutionarily stable strategy in both finite and infinite regime. We provide closed-form expression of the optimal pricing that gives an efficient resource-sharing policy. As the number of active players grows without bound, we show that the equilibrium strategy converges to a mean-field equilibrium, and the optimal prices for resources converge to the optimal price of the mean-field game. Then, we address the demand satisfaction problem for which a necessary and sufficient condition for satisfactory solutions is provided. In addition, a very fast mean-field learning algorithm is provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10893","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10893","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8428","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
