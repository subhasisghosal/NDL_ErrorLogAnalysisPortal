The growing area of software protection attempts to address the key steps used by hackers in attacking a software system. In this paper, we introduce a unique approach to embedded software protection that utilizes a hardware\/software codesign methodology. Results demonstrate that this framework can be the successful basis for the development of embedded applications that meet a wide range of security and performance requirements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6245","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6246","fieldValue":"Kwon, Woo-Cheol"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6246","fieldValue":" This paper presents important, new results of a study on the problem of task scheduling and voltage allocation in dynamically variable voltage processors, the purpose of which was minimization of processor energy consumption. The contributions are twofold: (1) For given multiple discrete supply voltages and tasks with arbitrary arrival-time\/deadline constraints, we propose a voltage allocation technique that produces a feasible task schedule with optimal processor energy consumption. (2) We then extend the problem to include the case in which tasks have nonuniform loads (i.e.; switched) capacitances and solve it optimally. The proposed technique, called Alloc-vt, in (1) is based on the prior results in [Yao, Demers and Shenker. 1995. In Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science. 374--382] (which is optimal for dynamically continuously variable voltages, but not for discrete ones) and [Ishihara and Yasuura. 1998. In Proceedings of International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design. 197--202] (which is optimal for a single task, but not for multiple tasks), whereas the proposed technique, called $Alloc-vt_cap$, in (2) is based on an efficient linear programming (LP) formulation. Both techniques solve the allocation problems optimally in polynomial time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6247","fieldValue":" As embedded systems get more complex, deployment of embedded operating systems (OSs) as software run-time engines has become common. In particular, this trend is true even for battery-powered embedded systems, where maximizing battery life is a primary concern. In such OS-driven embedded software, the overall energy consumption depends very much on which OS is used and how the OS is used. Therefore, the energy effects of the OS need to be studied in order to design low-energy systems effectively.In this paper, we discuss the motivation for performing OS energy characterization and propose a methodology to perform the characterization systematically. The methodology consists of two parts. The first part is analysis, which is concerned with identifying a set of components that can be used to characterize the OS energy consumption, called energy characteristics. The second part is macromodeling, which is concerned with obtaining quantitative macromodels for the energy characteristics. It involves the process of experiment design, data collection, and macromodel fitting. The OS energy macromodels can be used conveniently as OS energy estimators in high-level or architectural optimization of embedded systems for low-energy consumption.As far as we know, this work is the first attempt to systematically tackle energy macromodeling of an embedded OS. To demonstrate our approach, we present experimental results for two well-known embedded OSs, namely, Î¼C\/OS and embedded Linux OS."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6247","fieldValue":"ACM"}
