In the tiled code, however, tiles of different sizes can lead to significant variation in performance. Thus, selection of an optimal tile size is critical to performance of tiled codes. In the past, tile size selection has been attempted using both static analytical and dynamic empirical (auto-tuning) models. Past work using static models assumed a direct-mapped cache for the purpose of analysis and thus proved to be less robust. On the other hand, the auto-tuning models involve an exhaustive search in a large space of tiled codes. In this article, we propose a new analytical model for tile size selection that leverages the high set associativity in modern caches to minimize conflict misses. Our tile size selection model targets data reuse in multiple levels of cache. In addition, it considers the interaction of tiling with the SIMD unit in modern processors in estimating the optimal tile size. We find that these factors, not considered in previous models, are critical in developing a robust model for tile size selection. We implement our tile size selection model in a polyhedral compiler and test it on 12 benchmark kernels using two different problem sizes. Our model outperforms the previous analytical models that are based on reusing data in a single level of cache and achieves an average performance improvement of 9.7&percnt; and 20.4&percnt;, respectively, over the best square (cubic) tiles for the two problem sizes. In addition, the tile size chosen by our tile size selection algorithm is similar to the best performing size obtained through an extensive search, validating the analytical model underlying the algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1876","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9691","fieldValue":" A bifurcated approach is typically adopted to the regular virtual topology design problem. By exploiting key metrics that affect optimization solutions, it is shown that easily computed parameters, pertaining to the spread in inter-nodal distances and the spread in inter-nodal traffic, are descriptive and appropriate means to characterize problem inputs, the physical topology and the traffic matrix. The juxtaposition between these parameters and the optimization results is explored, culminating in the development of a novel holistic framework for regular virtual topology design. This framework offers the possibility of simplifying regular virtual topology design by presenting the different traditional design approaches as being nuances of a single overarching problem and suggesting criteria for choosing the most expedient design approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9691","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9691","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9691","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9692","fieldValue":" In this paper, we develop a new design approach to wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical interconnects with the objective of designing cost-effective and scalable interconnects. Our design philosophy strikes a balance between switching and conversion costs, and requires wavelength conversion only between two fixed and predefined wavelengths. The proposed design approach exploits the potential of the wavelength exchange optical crossbar (WOC)--a device that can switch signals simultaneously and seamlessly both in space and wavelength domains. We propose a novel crossbar switch that minimizes hardware and control complexity and use it as a building block for developing a new class of three-stage Clos-like WDM optical interconnects. The design space of the proposed interconnect is characterized and its hardware complexity is analyzed. We also show that the proposed crossbar switch and the new class of WDM interconnects admit most existing routing algorithms with simple modifications. In addition, we show that our design approach can be generalized to develop a class of k-stage NÃ\u2014N interconnects, 3 < k â\u2030¤ 2 log2N - 1."}
