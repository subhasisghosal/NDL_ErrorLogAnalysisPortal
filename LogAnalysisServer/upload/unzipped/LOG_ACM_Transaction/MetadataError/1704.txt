{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16094","fieldValue":" We present an example-based approach to hair modeling because creating hairstyles either manually or through image-based acquisition is a costly and time-consuming process. We introduce a hierarchical hair synthesis framework that views a hairstyle both as a 3D vector field and a 2D arrangement of hair strands on the scalp. Since hair forms wisps, a hierarchical hair clustering algorithm has been developed for detecting wisps in example hairstyles. The coarsest level of the output hairstyle is synthesized using traditional 2D texture synthesis techniques. Synthesizing finer levels of the hierarchy is based on cluster oriented detail transfer. Finally, we compute a discrete tangent vector field from the synthesized hair at every level of the hierarchy to remove undesired inconsistencies among hair trajectories. Improved hair trajectories can be extracted from the vector field. Based on our automatic hair synthesis method, we have also developed simple user-controlled synthesis and editing techniques including feature-preserving combing as well as detail transfer between different hairstyles."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16095","fieldValue":"Prince, Simon J D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16095","fieldValue":" Our goal is to generate novel realistic images of faces using a model trained from real examples. This model consists of two components: First we consider face images as samples from a texture with spatially varying statistics and describe this texture with a local non-parametric model. Second, we learn a parametric global model of all of the pixel values. To generate realistic faces, we combine the strengths of both approaches and condition the local non-parametric model on the global parametric model. We demonstrate that with appropriate choice of local and global models it is possible to reliably generate new realistic face images that do not correspond to any individual in the training data. We extend the model to cope with considerable intra-class variation (pose and illumination). Finally, we apply our model to editing real facial images: we demonstrate image in-painting, interactive techniques for improving synthesized images and modifying facial expressions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16095","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16095","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16096","fieldValue":" We present a method for generating realistic models of temperate-climate trees and shrubs. This method is based on the biological hypothesis that the form of a developing tree emerges from a self-organizing process dominated by the competition of buds and branches for light or space, and regulated by internal signaling mechanisms. Simulations of this process robustly generate a wide range of realistic trees and bushes. The generated forms can be controlled with a variety of interactive techniques, including procedural brushes, sketching, and editing operations such as pruning and bending of branches. We illustrate the usefulness and versatility of the proposed method with diverse tree models, forest scenes, animations of tree development, and examples of combined interactive-procedural tree modeling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16096","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16096","fieldValue":"ACM"}
