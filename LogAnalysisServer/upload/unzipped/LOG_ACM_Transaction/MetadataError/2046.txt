We introduce a multi-label (i.e., shapes can belong to multiple classes) semi-supervised approach that takes as input a large shape collection of a given category with associated sparse and noisy labels, and outputs cleaned and complete labels for each shape. The key idea of the proposed approach is to jointly learn a distance metric for each class which captures the underlying geometric similarity within that class, e.g., the distance metric for swivel chairs evaluates the global geometric resemblance of chair bases. We show how to achieve this objective by first geometrically aligning the input shapes, and then learning the class-specific distance metrics by exploiting the feature consistency provided by this alignment. The learning objectives consider both labeled data and the mutual relations between the distance metrics. Given the learned metrics, we apply a graph-based semi-supervised classification technique to generate the final classification results. In order to evaluate the performance of our approach, we have created a benchmark data set where each shape is provided with a set of ground truth labels generated by Amazon's Mechanical Turk users. The benchmark contains a rich variety of shapes in a number of categories. Experimental results show that despite this variety, given very sparse and noisy initial labels, the new method yields results that are superior to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16971","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16971","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16972","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16972","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16973","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16973","fieldValue":" We introduce projective analysis for semantic segmentation and labeling of 3D shapes. The analysis treats an input 3D shape as a collection of 2D projections, labels each projection by transferring knowledge from existing labeled images, and back-projects and fuses the labelings on the 3D shape. The image-space analysis involves matching projected binary images of 3D objects based on a novel bi-class Hausdorff distance. The distance is topology-aware by accounting for internal holes in the 2D figures and it is applied to piecewise-linearly warped object projections to compensate for part scaling and view discrepancies. Projective analysis simplifies the processing task by working in a lower-dimensional space, circumvents the requirement of having complete and well-modeled 3D shapes, and addresses the data challenge for 3D shape analysis by leveraging the massive available image data. A large and dense labeled set ensures that the labeling of a given projected image can be inferred from closely matched labeled images. We demonstrate semantic labeling of imperfect (e.g., incomplete or self-intersecting) 3D models which would be otherwise difficult to analyze without taking the projective analysis approach."}
