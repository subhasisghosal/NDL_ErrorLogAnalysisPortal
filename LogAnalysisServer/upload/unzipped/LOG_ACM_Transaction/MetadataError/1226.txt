In particular we study such representations for results of conjunctive queries. We derive tight asymptotic bounds for representation sizes and present algorithms to compute representations within these bounds. We compare the succinctness of f-representations and d-representations for results of equi-join queries, and relate them to fractional edge covers and fractional hypertree decompositions of the query hypergraph. Recent work showed that f-representations can significantly boost the performance of query evaluation in centralised and distributed settings and of machine learning tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14650","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14650","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14651","fieldValue":" We consider the classical tree edit distance between ordered labelled trees, which is defined as the minimum-cost sequence of node edit operations that transform one tree into another. The state-of-the-art solutions for the tree edit distance are not satisfactory. The main competitors in the field either have optimal worst-case complexity but the worst case happens frequently, or they are very efficient for some tree shapes but degenerate for others. This leads to unpredictable and often infeasible runtimes. There is no obvious way to choose between the algorithms. In this article we present RTED, a robust tree edit distance algorithm. The asymptotic complexity of our algorithm is smaller than or equal to the complexity of the best competitors for any input instance, that is, our algorithm is both efficient and worst-case optimal. This is achieved by computing a dynamic decomposition strategy that depends on the input trees. RTED is shown optimal among all algorithms that use LRH (left-right-heavy) strategies, which include RTED and the fastest tree edit distance algorithms presented in literature. In our experiments on synthetic and real-world data we empirically evaluate our solution and compare it to the state-of-the-art."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14651","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14651","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14652","fieldValue":" Recently, result diversification has attracted a lot of attention as a means to improve the quality of results retrieved by user queries. In this article, we introduce a novel definition of diversity called DisC diversity. Given a tuning parameter r, which we call radius, we consider two items to be similar if their distance is smaller than or equal to r. A DisC diverse subset of a result contains items such that each item in the result is represented by a similar item in the diverse subset and the items in the diverse subset are dissimilar to each other. We show that locating a minimum DisC diverse subset is an NP-hard problem and provide algorithms for its approximation. We extend our definition to the multiple radii case, where each item is associated with a different radius based on its importance, relevance, or other factors. We also propose adapting DisC diverse subsets to a different degree of diversification by adjusting r, that is, increasing the radius (or zooming-out) and decreasing the radius (or zooming-in). We present efficient implementations of our algorithms based on the M-tree, a spatial index structure, and experimentally evaluate their performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/14652","fieldValue":"Top-<i>k<\/i>"}
