Techniques intended to improve the performance of TCP for such connections can be grouped into three categories: end-to-end, link layer and split-connection approaches. Some simulations and experimental results indicate that split-connection protocols yield better performance than the other two approaches. Although analytical modeling of the end-to-end and link-layer approaches has been presented, no comparable performance analysis for split-connection protocols has been reported previously. In this paper, a stochastic model is developed and used to analyze the performance of a class of split-connection protocols which deploy TCP on the wireline network and a light-weight transport protocol on the wireless final hop. The final hop is provided by a digital TDMA cellular system. The condition of heavy source traffic to the wireless terminal is considered. The model relates the throughput and some useful auxiliary performance measures to key system parameters such as propagation delays, the base-station buffer size, the ARQ protocol and channel-error process of the wireless link. The usefulness of the analysis is illustrated by its application to the problem of sizing the TCP receiving buffer in a base station."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9226","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9226","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9226","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9227","fieldValue":" Currently, many bandwidth-intensive applications require multicast services for efficiency purposes. In particular, as wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique emerges as a promising solution to meet the rapidly growing demands on bandwidth in present communication networks, supporting multicast at the WDM layer becomes an important yet challenging issue. In this paper, we introduce a systematic approach to analyzing the multicast connection capacity of WDM switching networks with limited wavelength conversion. We focus on the practical all-optical limited wavelength conversion with a small conversion degree d (e.g., d = 2 or 3), where an incoming wavelength can be switched to one of the d outgoing wavelengths. We then compare the multicast performance of the network with limited wavelength conversion to that of no wavelength conversion and full wavelength conversion. Our results demonstrate that limited wavelength conversion with small conversion degrees provides a considerable fraction of the performance improvement obtained by full wavelength conversion over no wavelength conversion. We also present an economical multistage switching architecture for limited wavelength conversion. Our results indicate that the multistage switching architecture along with limited wavelength conversion of small degrees is a cost-effective design for WDM multicast switching networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9227","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9227","fieldValue":"ACM"}
