{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13512","fieldValue":" Cache memory, although important for boosting application performance, is also a source of execution time variability, and this makes its use difficult in systems requiring worst-case execution time (WCET) guarantees. Cache locking is a promising approach for simplifying WCET estimation and providing predictability, and hence, several commercial processors provide ability for locking cache. However, cache locking also has several disadvantages (e.g., extra misses for unlocked blocks, complex algorithms required for selection of locking contents) and hence, a careful management is required to realize the full potential of cache locking. In this article, we present a survey of techniques proposed for cache locking. We categorize the techniques into several groups to underscore their similarities and differences. We also discuss the opportunities and obstacles in using cache locking. We hope that this article will help researchers gain insight into cache locking schemes and will also stimulate further work in this area."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13512","fieldValue":"CPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13512","fieldValue":"GPU"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13513","fieldValue":" RC and single-inverter-based rail clamps are widely used in semiconductor products for electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection. We propose a technology-node-independent design methodology for these rail clamp circuits that takes process, voltage, and temperature variations into consideration. The methodology can be used as a cookbook by the designer or be used to automate the entire design process. Tradeoffs between various design metrics such as ESD performance (Human Body Model), leakage, and area are considered. Simplified circuit models for the rail clamp are presented to gain insights into its working and to size the circuit components. A rail clamp for core power domain is designed using the proposed approach in 40nm low-power process and performance results of the design are also presented. The effectiveness of the design methodology is proven in three different technology nodes by comparing the obtained design with the best design from among 250,000 designs obtained by randomly sampling from the design space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13514","fieldValue":" A dual-mode circuit is a circuit that has two operating modes: a default high-performance mode at nominal voltage and a secondary low-performance near-threshold voltage (NTV) mode. A key problem that we address is to maximize NTV mode clock frequency. Some cells that are particularly slow in NTV mode are optimized through transistor sizing and stack removal; static noise margin of each gate is extracted and appended in a library so that function failures can be checked and removed during synthesis. A new gate-sizing algorithm is proposed that takes account of timing slacks at both modes. A new sensitivity measure is introduced for this purpose; binary search is then applied to find the maximum NTV mode frequency. Clock-tree synthesis is reformulated to minimize clock skew at both modes. This is motivated by the fact that the proportion of load-dependent delay along clock paths, as well as clock-path delays themselves, should be made equal. Experiments on some test circuits indicate that NTV mode clock period is reduced by 24&percnt;, on average; clock skew at NTV decreases by 13&percnt;, on average; and NTV mode energy-delay product is reduced by 20&percnt;, on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13514","fieldValue":"ACM"}
