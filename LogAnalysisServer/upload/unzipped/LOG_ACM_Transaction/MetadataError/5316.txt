A wide range of clustering algorithms have been proposed in particular to analyze gene expression data, but most of them consider genes as independent entities or include relevant information on gene interactions in a suboptimal way. We propose a probabilistic model that has the advantage to account for individual data (e.g., expression) and pairwise data (e.g., interaction information coming from biological networks) simultaneously. Our model is based on hidden Markov random field models in which parametric probability distributions account for the distribution of individual data. Data on pairs, possibly reflecting distance or similarity measures between genes, are then included through a graph, where the nodes represent the genes, and the edges are weighted according to the available interaction information. As a probabilistic model, this model has many interesting theoretical features. In addition, preliminary experiments on simulated and real data show promising results and points out the gain in using such an approach.

MMNs generalize the standard notions of graphs and hypergraphs, which are the bases of current diagrammatic representations of biological phenomena, and incorporate the concept of mode. Each vertex of an MMN is a biological entity, a biot, while each modal hyperedge is a typed relationship, where the type is given by the mode of the hyperedge. The semantics of each modal hyperedge e is given through denotational semantics, where a valuation function f_{e} defines the relationship among the values of the vertices incident on e. The meaning of an MMN is denoted in terms of the semantics of a hyperedge sequence. A companion paper defines MMNs and concentrates on the structural aspects of MMNs. This paper develops MMN denotational semantics when used as a representation of the semantics of biological networks and discusses applications of MMNs in managing complex biological data."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4422","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4422","fieldValue":"Multimodal network, graph, hypergraph, biological networks, mode, biot, biological model, denotational semantics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4422","fieldValue":"ACM"}
