{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15908","fieldValue":" We present a real-time algorithm called compensated ray marching for rendering of smoke under dynamic low-frequency environment lighting. Our approach is based on a decomposition of the input smoke animation, represented as a sequence of volumetric density fields, into a set of radial basis functions (RBFs) and a sequence of residual fields. To expedite rendering, the source radiance distribution within the smoke is computed from only the low-frequency RBF approximation of the density fields, since the high-frequency residuals have little impact on global illumination under low-frequency environment lighting. Furthermore, in computing source radiances the contributions from single and multiple scattering are evaluated at only the RBF centers and then approximated at other points in the volume using an RBF-based interpolation. A slice-based integration of these source radiances along each view ray is then performed to render the final image. The high-frequency residual fields, which are a critical component in the local appearance of smoke, are compensated back into the radiance integral during this ray march to generate images of high detail. The runtime algorithm, which includes both light transfer simulation and ray marching, can be easily implemented on the GPU, and thus allows for real-time manipulation of viewpoint and lighting, as well as interactive editing of smoke attributes such as extinction cross section, scattering albedo, and phase function. Only moderate preprocessing time and storage is needed. This approach provides the first method for real-time smoke rendering that includes single and multiple scattering while generating results comparable in quality to offline algorithms like ray tracing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15908","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15908","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2508","fieldValue":" We show that, for every 0 â\u2030¤ p â\u2030¤ 1, there is an $O(n^2.575âˆ\u2019p\/(7.4âˆ\u20192.3p))-time algorithm that given a directed graph with small positive integer weights, estimates the length of the shortest path between every pair of vertices u, v in the graph to within an additive error Î\u201Dp$(u, v), where Î\u201D(u, v) is the exact length of the shortest path between u and v.

Previously the only way to â\u20ACœbeatâ\u20AC? the running time of the exact shortest path algorithms was by applying an algorithm of Zwick [2002] that approximates the shortest path distances within a multiplicative error of (1 + &epsi;). Our algorithm thus gives a smooth qualitative and quantitative transition between the fastest exact shortest paths algorithm, and the fastest approximation algorithm with a linear additive error. In fact, the main ingredient we need in order to obtain the above result, which is also interesting in its own right, is an algorithm for computing (1 + &epsi;) multiplicative approximations for the shortest paths, whose running time is faster than the running time of Zwick's approximation algorithm when &epsi; &Lt; 1 and the graph has small integer weights."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15909","fieldValue":" We introduce a meshless hierarchical representation for solving light transport problems. Precomputed radiance transfer (PRT) and finite elements require a discrete representation of illumination over the scene. Non-hierarchical approaches such as per-vertex values are simple to implement, but lead to long precomputation. Hierarchical bases like wavelets lead to dramatic acceleration, but in their basic form they work well only on flat or smooth surfaces. We introduce a hierarchical function basis induced by scattered data approximation. It is decoupled from the geometric representation, allowing the hierarchical representation of illumination on complex objects. We present simple data structures and algorithms for constructing and evaluating the basis functions. Due to its hierarchical nature, our representation adapts to the complexity of the illumination, and can be queried at different scales. We demonstrate the power of the new basis in a novel precomputed direct-to-indirect light transport algorithm that greatly increases the complexity of scenes that can be handled by PRT approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15909","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15909","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15910","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}
