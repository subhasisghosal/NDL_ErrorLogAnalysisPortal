Under Zaniolo's â\u20ACœno informationâ\u20AC? interpretation of null markers we establish an axiomatization and algorithms to decide the implication problem for the combined class of functional and multivalued dependencies in the presence of NOT NULL constraints. The resulting theory subsumes three previously orthogonal frameworks. We further show that the implication problem of this class is equivalent to that in a propositional fragment of Schaerf and Cadoli's [1995] family of para-consistent S-3 logics. In particular, S is the set of variables that correspond to attributes declared NOT NULL. We also show how our equivalences for multivalued dependencies can be extended to Delobel's class of full first-order hierarchical decompositions, and the equivalences for functional dependencies can be extended to arbitrary Boolean dependencies. These dualities allow us to transfer several findings from the propositional fragments to the corresponding classes of data dependencies, and vice versa. We show that our results also apply to Codd's null interpretation â\u20ACœvalue unknown at presentâ\u20AC?, but not to Imielinski's [1989] or-relations utilizing Levene and Loizou's weak possible world semantics [Levene and Loizou 1998]. Our findings establish NOT NULL constraints as an effective mechanism to balance not only the certainty in database relations but also the expressiveness with the efficiency of entailment relations. They also control the degree by which the implication of data dependencies over total relations is soundly approximated in SQL table definitions."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14565","fieldValue":"SQL"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14565","fieldValue":"The implication problem of data dependencies over SQL table definitions: Axiomatic, algorithmic and logical characterizations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14565","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14566","fieldValue":" In many applications involving multiple criteria optimal decision making, users may often want to make a personal trade-off among all optimal solutions for selecting one object that fits best their personal needs. As a key feature, the skyline in a multidimensional space provides the minimum set of candidates for such purposes by removing all points not preferred by any (monotonic) utility\/scoring functions; that is, the skyline removes all objects not preferred by any user no matter how their preferences vary. Driven by many recent applications with uncertain data, the probabilistic skyline model is proposed to retrieve uncertain objects based on skyline probabilities. Nevertheless, skyline probabilities cannot capture the preferences of monotonic utility functions. Motivated by this, in this article we propose a novel skyline operator, namely stochastic skylines. In the light of the expected utility principle, stochastic skylines guarantee to provide the minimum set of candidates to optimal solutions over a family of utility functions. We first propose the lskyline operator based on the lower orthant orders. lskyline guarantees to provide the minimum set of candidates to the optimal solutions for the family of monotonic multiplicative utility functions. While lskyline works very effectively for the family of multiplicative functions, it may miss optimal solutions for other utility \/scoring functions (e.g., linear functions). To resolve this, we also propose a general stochastic skyline operator, gskyline, based on the usual orders. gskyline provides the minimum candidate set to the optimal solutions for all monotonic functions. For the first time regarding the existing literature, we investigate the complexities of determining a stochastic order between two uncertain objects whose probability distributions are described discretely. We firstly show that determining the lower orthant order is NP-complete with respect to the dimensionality; consequently the problem of computing lskyline is NP-complete. We also show an interesting result as follows. While the usual order involves more complicated geometric forms than the lower orthant order, the usual order may be determined in polynomial time regarding all the inputs, including the dimensionality; this implies that gskyline can be computed in polynomial time. A general framework is developed for efficiently and effectively retrieving lskyline and gskyline from a set of uncertain objects, respectively, together with efficient and effective filtering techniques. Novel and efficient verification algorithms are developed to efficiently compute lskyline over multidimensional uncertain data, which run in polynomial time if the dimensionality is fixed, and to efficiently compute gskyline in polynomial time regarding all inputs. We also show, by theoretical analysis and experiments, that the sizes of lskyline and gskyline are both quite similar to that of conventional skyline over certain data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our techniques are efficient and scalable regarding both CPU and IO costs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14566","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14566","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14567","fieldValue":" The skyline query can help identify the â\u20ACœbestâ\u20AC? objects in a multi-attribute dataset. During the past decade, this query has received considerable attention in the database research community. Most research focused on computing the â\u20ACœskylineâ\u20AC? of a dataset, or the set of â\u20ACœskyline objectsâ\u20AC? that are not dominated by any other object. Such algorithms are not appropriate in an online system, which should respond in real time to skyline query requests with arbitrary subsets of the attributes (also called subspaces). To guarantee real-time response, an online system should precompute the skylines for all subspaces, and look up a skyline upon query. Unfortunately, because the number of subspaces is exponential to the number of attributes, such pre computation has very expensive storage cost and update cost. We propose the Compressed SkyCube (CSC) that is much more compact, yet can still return the skyline of any subspace without consulting the base table. The CSC therefore combines the advantage of precomputation in that it can respond to queries in real time, and the advantage of no-precomputation in that it has efficient space cost and update cost. This article presents the CSC data structures, the CSC query algorithm, the CSC update algorithm, and the CSC initial computation scheme. A solution to extend to high-dimensional data is also proposed."}
