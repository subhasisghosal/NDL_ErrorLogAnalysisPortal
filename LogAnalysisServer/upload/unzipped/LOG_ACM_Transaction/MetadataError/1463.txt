These \"holes\" in the surface are commonly filled with a smooth patch that conforms with the boundary. We introduce a context-based method: the characteristics of the given surface are analyzed, and the hole is iteratively filled by copying patches from valid regions of the given surface. In particular, the method needs to determine best matching patches, and then, fit imported patches by aligning them with the surrounding surface. The completion process works top down, where details refine intermediate coarser approximations. To align an imported patch with the existing surface, we apply a rigid transformation followed by an iterative closest point procedure with non-rigid transformations. The surface is essentially treated as a point set, and local implicit approximations aid in measuring the similarity between two point set patches. We demonstrate the method at several point-sampled surfaces, where the holes either result from imperfect sampling during range scanning or manual removal."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15475","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15475","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15476","fieldValue":" We present a robust method for repairing arbitrary polygon models. The method is guaranteed to produce a closed surface that partitions the space into disjoint internal and external volumes. Given any model represented as a polygon soup, we construct an inside\/outside volume using an octree grid, and reconstruct the surface by contouring. Our novel algorithm can efficiently process large models containing millions of polygons and is capable of reproducing sharp features in the original geometry."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15476","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15476","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2466","fieldValue":" The girth of a graph G is the length of a shortest cycle of G. In this article we design an $O(n^5\/4 log n) algorithm for finding the girth of an undirected n-vertex planar graph, the first o(n2$) algorithm for this problem. We also extend our results for the class of graphs embedded into an orientable surface of small genus. Our approach uses several techniques such as graph partitioning, hammock decomposition, graph covering, and dynamic shortest-path computation. We discuss extensions and generalizations of our result."}
