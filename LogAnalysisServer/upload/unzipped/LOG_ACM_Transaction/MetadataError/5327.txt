The main question studied is the design of efficient seed alphabets to construct seeds with optimal sensitivity\/selectivity trade-offs. We propose several different design methods and use them to construct several alphabets. We then perform a comparative analysis of seeds built over those alphabets and compare them with the standard Blastp seeding method [2], [3], as well as with the family of vector seeds proposed in [4]. While the formalism of subset seeds is less expressive (but less costly to implement) than the cumulative principle used in Blastp and vector seeds, our seeds show a similar or even better performance than Blastp on Bernoulli models of proteins compatible with the common BLOSUM62 matrix. Finally, we perform a large-scale benchmarking of our seeds against several main databases of protein alignments. Here again, the results show a comparable or better performance of our seeds versus Blastp."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4440","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4440","fieldValue":"Protein sequences, protein databases, local alignment, similarity search, seeds, subset seeds, multiple seeds, seed alphabet, sensitivity, selectivity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4440","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4440","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4441","fieldValue":" Phylogeniesâ\u20AC\u201Dthe evolutionary histories of groups of organismsâ\u20AC\u201Dplay a major role in representing the interrelationships among biological entities. Many methods for reconstructing and studying such phylogenies have been proposed, almost all of which assume that the underlying history of a given set of species can be represented by a binary tree. Although many biological processes can be effectively modeled and summarized in this fashion, others cannot: recombination, hybrid speciation, and horizontal gene transfer result in networks of relationships rather than trees of relationships. In previous works, we formulated a maximum parsimony (MP) criterion for reconstructing and evaluating phylogenetic networks, and demonstrated its quality on biological as well as synthetic data sets. In this paper, we provide further theoretical results as well as a very fast heuristic algorithm for the MP criterion of phylogenetic networks. In particular, we provide a novel combinatorial definition of phylogenetic networks in terms of â\u20ACœforbidden cycles,â\u20AC? and provide detailed hardness and hardness of approximation proofs for the \"smallâ\u20AC? MP problem. We demonstrate the performance of our heuristic in terms of time and accuracy on both biological and synthetic data sets. Finally, we explain the difference between our model and a similar one formulated by Nguyen et al., and describe the implications of this difference on the hardness and approximation results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4441","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4441","fieldValue":"ACM"}
