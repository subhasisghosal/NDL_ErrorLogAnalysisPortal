However, true imitation is based on abstraction and conceptualization. This article presents a model for conceptual imitation through interaction with the teacher to abstract spatio-temporal demonstrations based on their functional meaning. Abstraction, concept acquisition, and self-organization of proto-symbols are performed through an incremental and gradual learning algorithm. In this algorithm, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used to abstract perceptually similar demonstrations. However, abstract (relational) concepts emerge as a collection of HMMs irregularly scattered in the perceptual space but showing the same functionality. Performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in two experimental scenarios. The first one is a human-robot interaction task of imitating signs produced by hand movements. The second one is a simulated interactive task of imitating whole body motion patterns of a humanoid model. Experimental results show efficiency of our model for concept extraction, proto-symbol emergence, motion pattern recognition, prediction, and generation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7393","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7393","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7394","fieldValue":" Tracking recurring concept drifts is a significant issue for machine learning and data mining that frequently appears in real-world stream classification problems. It is a challenge for many streaming classification algorithms to learn recurring concepts in a data stream environment with unlabeled data, and this challenge has received little attention from the research community. Motivated by this challenge, this article focuses on the problem of recurring contexts in streaming environments with limited labeled data. We propose a semi-supervised classification algorithm for data streams with REcurring concept Drifts and Limited LAbeled data, called REDLLA, in which a decision tree is adopted as the classification model. When growing a tree, a clustering algorithm based on k-means is installed to produce concept clusters and unlabeled data are labeled in the method of majority-class at leaves. In view of deviations between history and new concept clusters, potential concept drifts are distinguished and recurring concepts are maintained. Extensive studies on both synthetic and real-world data confirm the advantages of our REDLLA algorithm over three state-of-the-art online classification algorithms of CVFDT, DWCDS, and CDRDT and several known online semi-supervised algorithms, even in the case with more than 90&percnt; unlabeled data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7394","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7394","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7395","fieldValue":" The success of simple methods for classification shows that is is often not necessary to model complex attribute interactions to obtain good classification accuracy on practical problems. In this article, we propose to exploit this phenomenon in the data stream context by building an ensemble of Hoeffding trees that are each limited to a small subset of attributes. In this way, each tree is restricted to model interactions between attributes in its corresponding subset. Because it is not known a priori which attribute subsets are relevant for prediction, we build exhaustive ensembles that consider all possible attribute subsets of a given size. As the resulting Hoeffding trees are not all equally important, we weigh them in a suitable manner to obtain accurate classifications. This is done by combining the log-odds of their probability estimates using sigmoid perceptrons, with one perceptron per class. We propose a mechanism for setting the perceptronsâ\u20AC™ learning rate using the change detection method for data streams, and also use to reset ensemble members (i.e., Hoeffding trees) when they no longer perform well. Our experiments show that the resulting ensemble classifier outperforms bagging for data streams in terms of accuracy when both are used in conjunction with adaptive naive Bayes Hoeffding trees, at the expense of runtime and memory consumption. We also show that our stacking method can improve the performance of a bagged ensemble."}
