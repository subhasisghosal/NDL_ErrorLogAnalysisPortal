Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that if connection\/disconnection frequency is too high, data blocks may be lost. This is true for most of the current DHT-based systems' implementations. To deal with this problem, it is necessary to build more efficient replication and maintenance mechanisms. In this article, we study the effect of churn on PAST, an existing DHT-based P2P system. We then propose solutions to enhance churn tolerance and evaluate them through discrete event simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1251","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1251","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3360","fieldValue":"OSullivan, Carol"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3360","fieldValue":" Panoramic images are very effective at conveying a visual sense of presence at very low cost and great ease of authoring. They are, however, limited in the navigation options they offer, unlike 3D representations. It is therefore desirable to provide pleasing transitions from one panorama to another, or from a panorama to a 3D model. We focus on motions where the viewers move toward an area of interest, and on the problem of dealing with occluders in their path. We discuss existing transition approaches, with emphasis on the additional information they require and on the constraints they place on the authoring process. We propose a compromise approach based on faking the parallax effect with occluder mattes. We conduct a user study to determine whether additional information does in fact increase the visual appeal of transitions. We observe that the creation of occluder mattes alone is only justified if the fake parallax effect can be synchronized with the camera motion (but not necessarily consistent with it), and if viewpoint discrepancies at occlusion boundaries are small. The faster the transition, the less perceptual value there is in creating mattes. Information on view alignment is always useful, as a dissolve effect is always preferred to fading to black and back."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3360","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3360","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24339","fieldValue":"Becerra-Fernandez, Irma"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24339","fieldValue":" This article presents the role of ontologies and Web mining techniques in the construction and maintenance of experts' profiles. This article also discusses the development of contemporary expertise-locator knowledge management systems and, specifically, the implementation details of two such systems: the Searchable Answer Generating Engine (SAGE), and Expert Seeker. SAGE is a Web-based expertise locator system, which searches for researchers in universities in Florida based on specified criteria, including expertise in a specific domain. Expert Seeker's purpose is to search for experts in one of the best-known knowledge organizations, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Implementation details, results to date, and future plans for these systems are also presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24339","fieldValue":"ACM"}
