Simulating these textures is necessary to generate models for realistic image synthesis. The textures formed are progressively variant, with the variations depending on the global and local geometric context. We present a method for capturing progressively varying textures and the relevant context parameters that control them. By relating textures and context parameters, we are able to transfer the textures to novel synthetic objects. We present examples of capturing chemical effects, such as rusting; mechanical effects, such as paint cracking; and biological effects, such as the growth of mold on a surface. We demonstrate a user interface that provides a method for specifying where an object is exposed to external agents. We show the results of complex, geometry-dependent textures evolving on synthetic objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15748","fieldValue":" Visual quality, low computational cost, and numerical stability are foremost goals in computer animation. An important ingredient in achieving these goals is the conservation of fundamental motion invariants. For example, rigid and deformable body simulation benefits greatly from the conservation of linear and angular momenta. In the case of fluids, however, none of the current techniques focuses on conserving invariants, and consequently, often introduce a visually disturbing numerical diffusion of vorticity. Just as important visually is the resolution of complex simulation domains. Doing so with regular (even if adaptive) grid techniques can be computationally delicate. In this article, we propose a novel technique for the simulation of fluid flows. It is designed to respect the defining differential properties, that is, the conservation of circulation along arbitrary loops as they are transported by the flow. Consequently, our method offers several new and desirable properties: Arbitrary simplicial meshes (triangles in 2D, tetrahedra in 3D) can be used to define the fluid domain; the computations involved in the update procedure are efficient due to discrete operators with small support; and it preserves discrete circulation, avoiding numerical diffusion of vorticity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15749","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15749","fieldValue":" This article introduces a method for mesh editing that is aimed at preserving shape and volume. We present two new developments: The first is a minimization of a functional expressing a geometric distance measure between two isometric surfaces. The second is a local volume analysis linking the volume of an object to its surface curvature. Our method is based upon the moving frames representation of meshes. Applying a rotation field to the moving frames defines an isometry. Given rotational constraints, the mesh is deformed by an optimal isometry defined by minimizing the distance measure between original and deformed meshes. The resulting isometry nicely preserves the surface details, but when large rotations are applied, the volumetric behavior of the model may be unsatisfactory. Using the local volume analysis, we define a scalar field by which we scale the moving frames. Scaled and rotated moving frames restore volumetric properties of the original mesh, while properly maintaining the surface details. Our results show that even extreme deformations can be applied to meshes, with only minimal distortion of surface details and object volume."}
