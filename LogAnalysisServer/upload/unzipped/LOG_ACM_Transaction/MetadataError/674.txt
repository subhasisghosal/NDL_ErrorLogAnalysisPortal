A key challenge in a multi-Vdd design is to control the complexity of the power-supply system and limit the demand for level shifters. This can be tackled by grouping cells of different supply voltages into a small number of voltage islands. Recently, an elegant algorithm was proposed for generating voltage islands that balance the power-versus-design-cost tradeoff under performance requirement, according to the placement proximity of the critical cells. One prerequisite of this algorithm is an initial voltage assignment at the standard-cell level that meets timing. In this article, we present a novel method to produce quality voltage assignment which not only meets timing but also forms good proximity of the critical cells to provide a smooth input to the aforementioned voltage island generation. Our algorithm is based on effective delay budgeting and efficient computation of physical proximity by Voronoi diagram. Our extensive experiments on real industrial designs show that our algorithm leads to 25&percnt;--75&percnt; improvement in the voltage island generation in terms of the number of voltage islands generated, with computation time only linear to design size."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13081","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13081","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13082","fieldValue":" In transaction-level modeling (TLM), verification methodologies based on transactions allow testbenches, properties, and IP cores in mixed TL-RTL designs to be reused. However, no papers in the literature analyze the effectiveness of transaction-based verification (TBV) in comparison to the more traditional RTL approach. The first contribution of this article is the introduction of a functional-fault-model-based methodology for demonstrating the effectiveness of reuse through TBV. A second contribution is the introduction of a similar methodology for efficient property checking which identifies and removes redundant properties prior to assertion-based verification or model checking."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13082","fieldValue":"TBV"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13082","fieldValue":"TLM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13082","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13082","fieldValue":"ACM"}
