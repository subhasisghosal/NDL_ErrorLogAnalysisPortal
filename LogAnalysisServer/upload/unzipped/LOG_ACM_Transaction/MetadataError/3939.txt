This device, which we call a â\u20ACœtactile contact lens,â\u20AC? is composed of a sheet and numerous pins arranged on one side of the sheet. Experimental results show that a small bump on a surface can be detected more accurately through this device than by bare finger and than through a flat sheet. A mathematical analysis of this phenomenon suggests two possible explanations for this phenomenon. One lies in the lever-like behavior of the pins. The pins convert the local inclination of the object surface into the tangential displacement of the skin surface. The second is the spatial aliasing effect resulting from the discrete contact. Due to this effect, the temporal change in the skin surface displacement is efficiently transduced into the temporal change in the skin tissue strain. The results of this analysis are then discussed in relation to other sensitivity-enhancing materials, tactile sensing mechanisms, and tactile\/haptic display devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3217","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3217","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22723","fieldValue":"Hoek, Andr van der"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22723","fieldValue":"Wiborg-Weber, Darcy"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22723","fieldValue":" Software Configuration Management (SCM) is an important discipline in professional software development and maintenance. The importance of SCM has increased as programs have become larger, more long lasting, and more mission and life critical. This article discusses the evolution of SCM technology from the early days of software development to the present, with a particular emphasis on the impact that university and industrial research has had along the way. Based on an analysis of the publication history and evolution in functionality of the available SCM systems, we trace the critical ideas in the field from their early inception to their eventual maturation in commercially and freely available SCM systems. In doing so, this article creates a detailed record of the critical value of SCM research and illustrates how research results have shaped the functionality of today's SCM systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22723","fieldValue":"ACM"}
