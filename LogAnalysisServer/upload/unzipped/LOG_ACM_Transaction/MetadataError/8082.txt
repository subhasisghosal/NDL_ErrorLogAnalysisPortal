Deterministic approaches verify tags one by one, and the communication overhead and time cost grow linearly with increasing size of tags. We design a fast and scalable counterfeits estimation scheme, INformative Counting (INC), which achieves sublinear authentication time and communication cost in batch verifications. The key novelty of INC builds on an FM-Sketch variant authentication synopsis that can capture key counting information using only sublinear space. With the help of this well-designed data structure, INC is able to provide authentication results with accurate estimates of the number of counterfeiting tags and genuine tags, while previous batch authentication methods merely provide 0\/1 results indicating the existence of counterfeits. We conduct detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to examine this design and the results show that INC significantly outperforms previous work in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10969","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10969","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10969","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10969","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2002","fieldValue":" During the past 10 years, the clock frequency of high-end superscalar processors has not increased. Performance keeps growing mainly by integrating more cores on the same chip and by introducing new instruction set extensions. However, this benefits only some applications and requires rewriting and\/or recompiling these applications. A more general way to accelerate applications is to increase the IPC, the number of instructions executed per cycle. Although the focus of academic microarchitecture research moved away from IPC techniques, the IPC of commercial processors was continuously improved during these years. We argue that some of the benefits of technology scaling should be used to raise the IPC of future superscalar cores further. Starting from microarchitecture parameters similar to recent commercial high-end cores, we show that an effective way to increase the IPC is to allow the out-of-order engine to issue more micro-ops per cycle. But this must be done without impacting the clock cycle. We propose combining two techniques: clustering and register write specialization. Past research on clustered microarchitectures focused on narrow issue clusters, as the emphasis at that time was on allowing high clock frequencies. Instead, in this study, we consider wide issue clusters, with the goal of increasing the IPC under a constant clock frequency. We show that on a wide issue dual cluster, a very simple steering policy that sends 64 consecutive instructions to the same cluster, the next 64 instructions to the other cluster, and so forth, permits tolerating an intercluster delay of three cycles. We also propose a method for decreasing the energy cost of sending results from one cluster to the other cluster."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2002","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10970","fieldValue":" A combined base station association and power control problem is studied for the uplink of multichannel multicell cellular networks, in which each channel is used by exactly one cell (i.e., base station). A distributed association and power update algorithm is proposed and shown to converge to a Nash equilibrium of a noncooperative game. We consider network models with discrete mobiles (yielding an atomic congestion game), as well as a continuum of mobiles (yielding a population game). We find that the equilibria need not be Pareto efficient, nor need they be system optimal. To address the lack of system optimality, we propose pricing mechanisms. It is shown that these mechanisms can be implemented in a distributed fashion."}
