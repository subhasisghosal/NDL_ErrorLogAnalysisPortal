This approximation, however, loses too much detail. In reality, objects represented by vertices and edges in such a graph possess some nontrivial internal structure that varies across and differentiates among distinct types of links or nodes. In this work, we abstract such additional information as network annotations. We introduce a network topology modeling framework that treats annotations as an extended correlation profile of a network. Assuming we have this profile measured for a given network, we present an algorithm to rescale it in order to construct networks of varying size that still reproduce the original measured annotation profile. Using this methodology, we accurately capture the network properties essential for realistic simulations of network applications and protocols, or any other simulations involving complex network topologies, including modeling and simulation of network evolution. We apply our approach to the Autonomous System (AS) topology of the Internet annotated with business relationships between ASs. This topology captures the large-scale structure of the Internet. In depth understanding of this structure and tools to model it are cornerstones of research on future Internet architectures and designs. We find that our techniques are able to accurately capture the structure of annotation correlations within this topology, thus reproducing a number of its important properties in synthetically-generated random graphs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24985","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24985","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24986","fieldValue":" We develop exact random variate generators for the polynomially and exponentially tilted unilateral stable distributions.

The ability to predict fire spread behavior, optimize a plan for firefighting resource dispatch and evaluate such a plan using several firefighting tactics is essential for supporting decision making for containing wildfires. In this article, we present an integrated framework for wildfire spread simulation, firefighting resource optimization and wildfire suppression simulation. We present a stochastic mixed-integer programming model for initial attack to generate firefighting resource dispatch plans using as input fire spread scenario results from a standard wildfire behavior simulator. A new agent-based discrete event simulation model for fire suppression is used to simulate fire suppression based on dispatch plans from the stochastic optimization model, and in turn provides feedback to the optimization model for revising the dispatch plans if necessary. We report on several experimental results, which demonstrate that different firefighting tactics can lead to significantly different fire suppression results for a given dispatch plan, and simulation of these tactics can provide valuable information for fire managers in selecting dispatch plans from optimization models before actual implementation in the field."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24987","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24987","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24988","fieldValue":" This note corrects an error in Ghosh and Henderson [2003]."}
