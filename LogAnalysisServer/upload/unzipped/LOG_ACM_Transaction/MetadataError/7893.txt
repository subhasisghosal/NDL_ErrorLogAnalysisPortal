We systematically study a large number of Internet paths between popular video destinations and clients to create an empirical understanding of location, persistence, and recurrence of failures. These failures are mapped to perceived video quality by reconstructing video clips and conducting surveys. We then investigate ways to recover from QoE degradation by choosing one-hop detour paths that preserve application-specific policies. We seek simple, scalable path selection strategies without the need for background path monitoring. Using five different measurement overlays spread across the globe, we show that a source can recover from over 75% of the degradations by attempting to restore QoE with any k randomly chosen nodes in an overlay, where k is bounded by O(ln(N)). We argue that our results are robust across datasets. Finally, we design and implement a prototype packet forwarding module called source initiated frame restoration (SIFR). We deployed SIFR on PlanetLab nodes and compared the performance of SIFR to the default Internet routing. We show that SIFR outperforms IP-path selection by providing higher on-screen perceptual quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10600","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10601","fieldValue":" We study the optimal usage-based pricing problem in a resource-constrained network with one profit-maximizing service provider and multiple groups of surplus-maximizing users. With the assumption that the service provider knows the utility function of each user (thus complete information), we find that the complete price differentiation scheme can achieve a large revenue gain (e.g., 50%) compared to no price differentiation, when the total network resource is comparably limited and the high-willingness-to-pay users are minorities. However, the complete price differentiation scheme may lead to a high implementational complexity. To trade off the revenue against the implementational complexity, we further study the partial price differentiation scheme and design a polynomial-time algorithm that can compute the optimal partial differentiation prices. We also consider the incomplete information case where the service provider does not know to which group each user belongs. We show that it is still possible to realize price differentiation under this scenario and provide the sufficient and necessary condition under which an incentive-compatible differentiation scheme can achieve the same revenue as under complete information."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10601","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10601","fieldValue":"ACM"}
