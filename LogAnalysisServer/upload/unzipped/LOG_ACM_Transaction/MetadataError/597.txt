The problem has been proved to be NP-hard previously. Therefore, we present an efficient heuristic algorithm to generate low-power mapping solutions. The key idea is to compute and select low-power K-feasible cuts by an efficient incremental network flow computation method. Experimental results show that our algorithm reduces power consumption as well as area over the best algorithms reported in the literature. In addition, we present an extension to compute depth-optimal low-power mappings. Compared with Cutmap, a depth-optimal mapper with simultaneous area minimization, we achieve a 14&percnt; power savings on average without any depth penalty."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12896","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12896","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12896","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12897","fieldValue":" Most vendors of digital signal processors (DSPs) support a Harvard architecture, which has two or more memory buses, one for program and one or more for data and allow the processor to access multiple words of data from memory in a single instruction cycle. Also, many existing fixed-point DSPs are known to have an irregular architecture with heterogeneous registers, which contains multiple register files that are distributed and dedicated to different sets of instructions. Although there have been several studies conducted to efficiently assign data to multimemory banks, most of them assumed processors with relatively simple, homogeneous general-purpose registers. Thus, several vendor-provided compilers for DSPs that we examined were unable to efficiently assign data to multiple data memory banks, thereby often failing to generate highly optimized code for their machines. As a consequence, programmers for these DSPs often manually assign program variables to memories so as to fully utilize multimemory banks in their code. This paper reports on our recent attempt to address this problem by presenting an algorithm that helps the compiler to efficiently assign data to multimemory banks. Our algorithm differs from previous work in that it assigns variables to memory banks in separate, decoupled code generation phases, instead of a single, tightly coupled phase. The experimental results have revealed that our decoupled algorithm greatly simplifies our code generation process; thus our compiler runs extremely fast, yet generates target code that is comparable in quality to the code generated by a coupled approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12897","fieldValue":"DSP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12897","fieldValue":"ACM"}
