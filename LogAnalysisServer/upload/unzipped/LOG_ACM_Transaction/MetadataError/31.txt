However, there is little theory on collaborative learning with visualization, and few studies on their effect on each other. We build on the concept of the engagement taxonomy and extend it to classify finer variations in the engagement that result from the use of a visualization tool. We analyze the applicability of the taxonomy to the description of the differences in the collaboration process when visualization is used. Our hypothesis is that increasing the level of engagement between learners and the visualization tool results in a higher positive impact of the visualization on the collaboration process. This article describes an empirical investigation designed to test the hypothesis. The results provide support for our extended engagement taxonomy and hypothesis by showing that the collaborative activities of the students and the engagement levels are correlated."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11044","fieldValue":"Issue 2(Special Issue on the 5th Program Visualization Workshop (PVW&rsquo;08)), June 2009"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11084","fieldValue":"Velzquez-Iturbide, J ngel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11084","fieldValue":" This special issue presents extended versions of six papers presented at the 5th Program Visualization Workshop (PVWâ\u20AC™08). The articles deal with many of the issues relevant to program and algorithm visualization in education. This foreword introduces these issues to better understand the challenges addressed by every article, and their relevance, as well as the articles featured. These issues are evaluation of program and algorithm visualization, integration of visualization and narratives into hypertextbooks, embedding of interactive quizzes into visualizations, and several classes of program visualization."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11084","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11084","fieldValue":"ACM"}
