{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17668","fieldValue":" We introduce a co-analysis technique designed for correspondence inference within large shape collections. Such collections are naturally rich in variation, adding ambiguity to the notoriously difficult problem of correspondence computation. We leverage the robustness of correspondences between similar shapes to address the difficulties associated with this problem. In our approach, pairs of similar shapes are extracted from the collection, analyzed and matched in an efficient and reliable manner, culminating in the construction of a network of correspondences that connects the entire collection. The correspondence between any pair of shapes then amounts to a simple propagation along the minimax path between the two shapes in the network. At the heart of our approach is the introduction of a robust, structure-oriented shape matching method. Leveraging the idea of projective analysis, we partition 2D projections of a shape to obtain a set of 1D ordered regions, which are both simple and efficient to match. We lift the matched projections back to the 3D domain to obtain a pairwise shape correspondence. The emphasis given to structural compatibility is a central tool in estimating the reliability and completeness of a computed correspondence, uncovering any non-negligible semantic discrepancies that may exist between shapes. These detected differences are a deciding factor in the establishment of a network aiming to capture local similarities. We demonstrate that the combination of the presented observations into a co-analysis method allows us to establish reliable correspondences among shapes within large collections."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17669","fieldValue":" We present a technique for parsing widely used furniture assembly instructions, and reconstructing the 3D models of furniture components and their dynamic assembly process. Our technique takes as input a multi-step assembly instruction in a vector graphic format and starts to group the vector graphic primitives into semantic elements representing individual furniture parts, mechanical connectors (e.g., screws, bolts and hinges), arrows, visual highlights, and numbers. To reconstruct the dynamic assembly process depicted over multiple steps, our system identifies previously built 3D furniture components when parsing a new step, and uses them to address the challenge of occlusions while generating new 3D components incrementally. With a wide range of examples covering a variety of furniture types, we demonstrate the use of our system to animate the 3D furniture assembly process and, beyond that, the semantic-aware furniture editing as well as the fabrication of personalized furnitures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17669","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17669","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2671","fieldValue":" We present a linear-time algorithm to compute a decomposition scheme for graphs G that have a set XâŠ\u2020V(G), called a treewidth-modulator, such that the treewidth of G âˆ\u2019 X is bounded by a constant. Our decomposition, called a protrusion decomposition, is the cornerstone in obtaining the following two main results. Our first result is that any parameterized graph problem (with parameter k) that has a finite integer index and such that Yes-instances have a treewidth-modulator of size O(k) admits a linear kernel on the class of H-topological-minor-free graphs, for any fixed graph H. This result partially extends previous meta-theorems on the existence of linear kernels on graphs of bounded genus and H-minor-free graphs. Let F be a fixed finite family of graphs containing at least one planar graph. Given an n-vertex graph G and a non-negative integer k, Planar-F-Deletion asks whether G has a set XâŠ\u2020V(G) such that &verbar;X&verbar; &les; k and G âˆ\u2019 X is H-minor-free for every H &epsi; F. As our second application, we present the first single-exponential algorithm to solve Planar-F-Deletion. Namely, our algorithm runs in time $2^O(k) Â· n2$, which is asymptotically optimal with respect to k. So far, single-exponential algorithms were only known for special cases of the family F."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17670","fieldValue":" We introduce a framework for action-driven evolution of 3D indoor scenes, where the goal is to simulate how scenes are altered by human actions, and specifically, by object placements necessitated by the actions. To this end, we develop an action model with each type of action combining information about one or more human poses, one or more object categories, and spatial configurations of objects belonging to these categories which summarize the object-object and object-human relations for the action. Importantly, all these pieces of information are learned from annotated photos. Correlations between the learned actions are analyzed to guide the construction of an action graph. Starting with an initial 3D scene, we probabilistically sample a sequence of actions from the action graph to drive progressive scene evolution. Each action triggers appropriate object placements, based on object co-occurrences and spatial configurations learned for the action model. We show results of our scene evolution that lead to realistic and messy 3D scenes, as well as quantitative evaluations by user studies which compare our method to manual scene creation and state-of-the-art, data-driven methods, in terms of scene plausibility and naturalness."}
