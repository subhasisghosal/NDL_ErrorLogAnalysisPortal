Such technologies are helpful for spatial cognition while reading. However, users have to move their fingers slowly, or they may lose their place on screen. Also, IBSVI may wander between lines without realizing they did. We addressed these two interaction problems by introducing a dynamic speech-touch interaction model and an intelligent reading support system. With this model, the speed of the speech will dynamically change with the userâ\u20AC™s finger speed. The proposed model is composed of (1) an Audio Dynamics Model and (2) an Off-line Speech Synthesis Technique. The intelligent reading support system predicts the direction of reading, corrects the reading word if the user drifts, and notifies the user using a sonic gutter to help him\/her from straying off the reading line. We tested the new audio dynamics model, the sonic gutter, and the reading support model in two user studies. The participantsâ\u20AC™ feedback helped us fine-tune the parameters of the two models. A decomposition study was conducted to evaluate the main components of the system. The results showed that both intelligent reading support with tactile feedback are required to achieve the best performance in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Finally, we ran an evaluation study where the reading support system is compared to other VoiceOver technologies. The results showed preponderance to the reading support system with its audio dynamics and intelligent reading support components."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/7259","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Port Said University, and RIT, USA (El-Glaly, Yasmine N.); Texas A&#x38;M University, TX, USA (Quek, Francis)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7260","fieldValue":"Morency, Louis-Philippe"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7260","fieldValue":" Our lives are heavily influenced by persuasive communication, and it is essential in almost any type of social interaction from business negotiation to conversation with our friends and family. With the rapid growth of social multimedia websites, it is becoming ever more important and useful to understand persuasiveness in the context of social multimedia content online. In this article, we introduce a newly created multimedia corpus of 1,000 movie review videos with subjective annotations of persuasiveness and related high-level characteristics or attributes (e.g., confidence). This dataset will be made freely available to the research community. We designed our experiments around the following five main research hypotheses. First, we study if computational descriptors derived from verbal and nonverbal behavior can be predictive of persuasiveness. We further explore combining descriptors from multiple communication modalities (acoustic, verbal, para-verbal, and visual) for predicting persuasiveness and compare with using a single modality alone. Second, we investigate how certain high-level attributes, such as credibility or expertise, are related to persuasiveness and how the information can be used in modeling and predicting persuasiveness. Third, we investigate differences when speakers are expressing a positive or negative opinion and if the opinion polarity has any influence in the persuasiveness prediction. Fourth, we further study if gender has any influence in the prediction performance. Last, we test if it is possible to make comparable predictions of persuasiveness by only looking at thin slices (i.e., shorter time windows) of a speaker's behavior."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7260","fieldValue":"ACM"}
