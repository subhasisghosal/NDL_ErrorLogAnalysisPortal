Such encryption schemes find numerous applications, particularly in the context of privacy-preserving smart metering. This article presents a general framework for constructing privacy-preserving aggregator-oblivious encryption schemes using a variant of Cramer-Shoupâ\u20AC™s paradigm of smooth projective hashing. This abstraction leads to new schemes based on a variety of complexity assumptions. It also improves upon existing constructions, providing schemes with shorter ciphertexts and better encryption times."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22410","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22411","fieldValue":" Biometric authentication verifies a user based on its inherent, unique characteristicsâ\u20AC\u201Dwho you are. In addition to physiological biometrics, behavioral biometrics has proven very useful in authenticating a user. Mouse dynamics, with their unique patterns of mouse movements, is one such behavioral biometric. In this article, we present a user verification system using mouse dynamics, which is transparent to users and can be naturally applied for continuous reauthentication. The key feature of our system lies in using much more fine-grained (point-by-point) angle-based metrics of mouse movements for user verification. These new metrics are relatively unique from person to person and independent of a computing platform. Moreover, we utilize support vector machines (SVMs) for quick and accurate classification. Our technique is robust across different operating platforms, and no specialized hardware is required. The efficacy of our approach is validated through a series of experiments, which are based on three sets of user mouse movement data collected in controllable environments and in the field. Our experimental results show that the proposed system can verify a user in an accurate and timely manner, with minor induced system overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22411","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22411","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22412","fieldValue":" When people utilize social applications and services, their privacy suffers a potential serious threat. In this article, we present a novel, robust, and effective de-anonymization attack to mobility trace data and social data. First, we design a Unified Similarity (US) measurement, which takes account of local and global structural characteristics of data, information obtained from auxiliary data, and knowledge inherited from ongoing de-anonymization results. By analyzing the measurement on real datasets, we find that some data can potentially be de-anonymized accurately and the other can be de-anonymized in a coarse granularity. Utilizing this property, we present a US-based De-Anonymization (DA) framework, which iteratively de-anonymizes data with accuracy guarantee. Then, to de-anonymize large-scale data without knowledge of the overlap size between the anonymized data and the auxiliary data, we generalize DA to an Adaptive De-Anonymization (ADA) framework. By smartly working on two core matching subgraphs, ADA achieves high de-anonymization accuracy and reduces computational overhead. Finally, we examine the presented de-anonymization attack on three well-known mobility traces: St Andrews, Infocom06, and Smallblue, and three social datasets: ArnetMiner, Google+, and Facebook. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented de-anonymization framework is very effective and robust to noise. The source code and employed datasets are now publicly available at SecGraph [2015]."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22412","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22412","fieldValue":"ACM"}
