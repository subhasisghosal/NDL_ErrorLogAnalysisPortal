In this article, we introduce a new design environment, called SoCDAL, for accelerating multiprocessor system-on-chip design through fast design-space exploration targeting real-time multimedia systems. SoCDAL is a set of mostly automated tools covering system specification, hardware\/software estimation, application-to-architecture mapping, simulation model generation, and system verification through simulation. For system specification, the process network model has been widely used for system specification because of its modeling capability. However, it is hard to use for real-time systems design, since its behavior cannot be estimated statically. We introduce a new approach which enables analyzing a process network model statically with some restrictions. For the hardware\/software estimation, we analyze codes statically. Application-to-architecture mapping process implements a novel algorithm to support an arbitrary number of processors, with performance evaluation by static scheduling considering communication behavior. Mapping results are used to generate simulation models automatically at several transaction levels to be pipelined to a commercial tool. We show the effectiveness of our approaches by some experimental results with multimedia applications such as JPEG, H.263, and H.264 encoders, as well as an H.264 decoder."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13052","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13052","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13053","fieldValue":" Successful proliferation of multimedia-enabled devices and advances in very large-scale integration (VLSI) technology has spawned new research efforts in migrating video processing applications onto ever smaller and more inexpensive devices. This article focuses on the technical challenges associated with that migration. Due to limitations in size, battery lifetime, and, ultimately, cost, mapping complex video applications onto resource-constrained systems is a very challenging proposition. To this end, we first consider a technique, region-of-interest (ROI) processing, of defining a window within a video frame and only operating on the data inside that window, ignoring the rest of the frame. By using this lossy technique, the processing requirements can be reduced by roughly 80&percnt; while the error introduced in the quality of the results is roughly 10&percnt;. The other technique is adaptive data partitioning (ADP) combined with a content-based power management algorithm. By distributing video processing among multiple processors and shutting them down when they are not needed, the energy consumed per processor can be reduced by 60&percnt; without sacrificing the performance of the underlying video-based application. Taken together, these novel techniques enable ambient multimedia systems and maintain the needed overall efficiency in video processing."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13053","fieldValue":"Enabling multimedia using resource-constrained video processing techniques: A node-centric perspective"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13053","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13053","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13054","fieldValue":" This article presents our work on the development of a fuel cell (FC) and battery hybrid (FC-Bh) system for use in portable microelectronic systems. We describe the design and control of the hybrid system, as well as a dynamic power management (DPM)-based energy management policy that extends its operational lifetime. The FC is of the proton exchange membrane (PEM) type, operates at room temperature, and has an energy density which is 4--6 times that of a Li-ion battery. The FC cannot respond to sudden changes in the load, and so a system powered solely by the FC is not economical. An FC-Bh power source, on the other hand, can provide the high energy density of the FC and the high power density of a battery. In this work we first describe the prototype FC-Bh system that we have built. Such a prototype helps to characterize the performance of a hybrid power source, and also helps explore new energy management strategies for embedded systems powered by hybrid sources. Next we describe a Matlab\/Simulink-based FC-Bh system simulator which serves as an alternate experimental platform and that enables quick evaluation of system-level control policies. Finally, we present an optimization framework that explicitly considers the characteristics of the FC-Bh system and is aimed at minimizing the fuel consumption. This optimization framework is applied on top of a prediction-based DPM policy and is used to derive a new fuel-efficient DPM scheme. The proposed scheme demonstrates up to 32&percnt; system lifetime extension compared to a competing scheme when run on a real trace-based MPEG encoding example."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13054","fieldValue":"DPM"}
