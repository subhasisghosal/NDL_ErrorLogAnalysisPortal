Unlike existing information extraction methods that do not consider the popularity of product attributes, our proposed framework is able to not only detect popular product features from a collection of customer reviews but also map these popular features to the related product attributes. One novelty of our framework is that it can bridge the vocabulary gap between the text in product description pages and the text in customer reviews. Technically, we develop a discriminative graphical model based on hidden Conditional Random Fields. As an unsupervised model, our framework can be easily applied to a variety of new domains and Web sites without the need of labeling training samples. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24522","fieldValue":"Unsupervised Extraction of Popular Product Attributes from E-Commerce Web Sites by Considering Customer Reviews"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24523","fieldValue":" The choice of cloud providers whose offers best fit the requirements of a particular application is a complex issue due to the heterogeneity of the services in terms of resources, costs, technology, and service levels that providers ensure. This article investigates the effectiveness of multiobjective genetic algorithms to resolve a multicloud brokering problem. Experimental results provide clear evidence about how such a solution improves the choice made manually by users returning in real time optimal alternatives. It also investigates how the optimality depends on different genetic algorithms and parameters, problem type, and time constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24524","fieldValue":" We have developed a novel methodology for deriving bandwidth prices for premium direct peering between Access ISPs (A-ISPs) and Content and Service Providers (CSPs) that want to deliver content and services in premium quality. Our methodology establishes a direct link between service profitability, for example, from advertising, user and subscriber loyalty, interconnection costs, and finally bandwidth price for peering. Unlike existing work in both the networking and economics literature, our resulting computational model, built around Nash bargaining, can be used for deriving quantitative results comparable to actual market prices. We analyze the U.S. market and derive prices for video, that compare favorably with existing prices for transit and paid peering. We also observe that the fair prices returned by the model for high-profit\/low-volume services such as search, are orders of magnitude higher than current bandwidth prices. This implies that resolving existing (fierce) interconnection tussles may require per service, instead of wholesale, peering between A-ISPs and CSPs. Our model can be used for deriving initial benchmark prices for such negotiations."}
