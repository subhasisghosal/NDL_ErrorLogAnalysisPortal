Such metasearch provides a mechanism for locating documents on the hidden Web and, by use of sampling, can proceed even when the collections are uncooperative. However, the similarity scores for documents returned from different collections are not comparable, and, in uncooperative environments, document scores are unlikely to be reported. We introduce a new merging method for uncooperative environments, in which similarity scores for the sampled documents held for each collection are used to estimate global scores for the documents returned per query. This method requires no assumptions about properties such as the retrieval models used. Using experiments on a wide range of collections, we show that in many cases our merging methods are significantly more effective than previous techniques."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23987","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23987","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23988","fieldValue":" While navigation within complex information spaces is a problem for all users, the problem is most evident with individuals who are blind who cannot simply locate, point, and click on a link in hypertext documents with a mouse. Users who are blind have to listen searching for the link in the document using only the keyboard and a screen reader program, which may be particularly inefficient in large documents with many links or deep hierarchies that are hard to navigate. Consequently, they are especially penalized when the information being searched is hidden under multiple layers of indirections. In this article, we introduce a segment-enrich-annotate (SEA) paradigm for adapting digital content with deep structures for improved accessibility. In particular, we instantiate and evaluate this paradigm through the iCare-Assistant, an assistive system for helping students who are blind in accessing Web and electronic course materials. Our evaluations, involving the participation of students who are blind, showed that the iCare-Assistant system, built based on the SEA paradigm, reduces the navigational overhead significantly and enables user who are blind access complex online course servers effectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23988","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23988","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23989","fieldValue":"Hoi, Steven C H"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23989","fieldValue":" Support vector machine (SVM) active learning is one popular and successful technique for relevance feedback in content-based image retrieval (CBIR). Despite the success, conventional SVM active learning has two main drawbacks. First, the performance of SVM is usually limited by the number of labeled examples. It often suffers a poor performance for the small-sized labeled examples, which is the case in relevance feedback. Second, conventional approaches do not take into account the redundancy among examples, and could select multiple examples that are similar (or even identical). In this work, we propose a novel scheme for explicitly addressing the drawbacks. It first learns a kernel function from a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data, and therefore alleviates the problem of small-sized training data. The kernel will then be used for a batch mode active learning method to identify the most informative and diverse examples via a min-max framework. Two novel algorithms are proposed to solve the related combinatorial optimization: the first approach approximates the problem into a quadratic program, and the second solves the combinatorial optimization approximately by a greedy algorithm that exploits the merits of submodular functions. Extensive experiments with image retrieval using both natural photo images and medical images show that the proposed algorithms are significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches.
