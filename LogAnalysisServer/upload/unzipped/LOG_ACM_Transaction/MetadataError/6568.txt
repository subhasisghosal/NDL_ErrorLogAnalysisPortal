In this article, we propose a novel weak semantic technique for query expansion. Traditional query expansion techniques are based on the computation of two-dimensional co-occurrence matrices. Our approach proposes the use of three-dimensional matrices, where the added dimension is represented by semantic classes (i.e., categories comprising all the terms that share a semantic property) related to the folksonomy extracted from social bookmarking services, such as delicious and StumbleUpon. The results of an indepth experimental evaluation performed on both artificial datasets and real users show that our approach outperforms traditional techniques, such as relevance feedback and personalized PageRank, so confirming the validity and usefulness of the categorization of the user needs and preferences in semantic classes. We also present the results of a questionnaire aimed to know the users opinion regarding the system. As one drawback of several query expansion techniques is their high computational costs, we also provide a complexity analysis of our system, in order to show its capability of operating in real time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7503","fieldValue":"Shyu, Mei-Ling"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7503","fieldValue":" Multimedia data on social websites contain rich semantics and are often accompanied with user-defined tags. To enhance Web media semantic concept retrieval, the fusion of tag-based and content-based models can be used, though it is very challenging. In this article, a novel semantic concept retrieval framework that incorporates tag removal and model fusion is proposed to tackle such a challenge. Tags with useful information can facilitate media search, but they are often imprecise, which makes it important to apply noisy tag removal (by deleting uncorrelated tags) to improve the performance of semantic concept retrieval. Therefore, a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)-based tag removal algorithm is proposed, which utilizes MCA's ability to capture the relationships among nominal features and identify representative and discriminative tags holding strong correlations with the target semantic concepts. To further improve the retrieval performance, a novel model fusion method is also proposed to combine ranking scores from both tag-based and content-based models, where the adjustment of ranking scores, the reliability of models, and the correlations between the intervals divided on the ranking scores and the semantic concepts are all considered. Comparative results with extensive experiments on the NUS-WIDE-LITE as well as the NUS-WIDE-270K benchmark datasets with 81 semantic concepts show that the proposed framework outperforms baseline results and the other comparison methods with each component being evaluated separately."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7503","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7504","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7504","fieldValue":"ACM"}
