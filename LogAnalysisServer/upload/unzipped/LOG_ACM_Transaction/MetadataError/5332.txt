{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4448","fieldValue":" To unscramble the relationship between protein function and protein structure, it is essential to assess the protein similarity from different aspects. Although many methods have been proposed for protein structure alignment or comparison, alternative similarity measures are still strongly demanded due to the requirement of fast screening and query in large-scale structure databases. In this paper, we first formulate a novel representation of a protein structure, i.e., Feature Sequence of Surface (FSS). Then, a new score scheme is developed to measure the similarity between two representations. To verify the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted in four different protein data sets. We also classify SARS coronavirus to verify the effectiveness of the new method. Furthermore, preliminary results of fast classification of the whole CATH v2.5.1 database based on the new macrostructure similarity are given as a pilot study. We demonstrate that the proposed approach to measure the similarities between protein structures is simple to implement, computationally efficient, and surprisingly fast. In addition, the method itself provides a new and quantitative tool to view a protein structure."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4448","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4448","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4448","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4449","fieldValue":" Cluster analysis has proven to be a useful tool for investigating the association structure among genes in a microarray data set. There is a rich literature on cluster analysis and various techniques have been developed. Such analyses heavily depend on an appropriate (dis)similarity measure. In this paper, we introduce a general clustering approach based on the confidence interval inferential methodology, which is applied to gene expression data of microarray experiments. Emphasis is placed on data with low replication (three or five replicates). The proposed method makes more efficient use of the measured data and avoids the subjective choice of a dissimilarity measure. This new methodology, when applied to real data, provides an easy-to-use bioinformatics solution for the cluster analysis of microarray experiments with replicates (see the Appendix). Even though the method is presented under the framework of microarray experiments, it is a general algorithm that can be used to identify clusters in any situation. The method's performance is evaluated using simulated and publicly available data set. Our results also clearly show that our method is not an extension of the conventional clustering method based on correlation or euclidean distance."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4449","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4449","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4449","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4450","fieldValue":" Until recently, numerous feature selection techniques have been proposed and found wide applications in genomics and proteomics. For instance, feature\/gene selection has proven to be useful for biomarker discovery from microarray and mass spectrometry data. While supervised feature selection has been explored extensively, there are only a few unsupervised methods that can be applied to exploratory data analysis. In this paper, we address the problem of unsupervised feature selection. First, we extend Laplacian linear discriminant analysis (LLDA) to unsupervised cases. Second, we propose a novel algorithm for computing LLDA, which is efficient in the case of high dimensionality and small sample size as in microarray data. Finally, an unsupervised feature selection method, called LLDA-based Recursive Feature Elimination (LLDA-RFE), is proposed. We apply LLDA-RFE to several public data sets of cancer microarrays and compare its performance with those of Laplacian score and SVD-entropy, two state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, and with that of Fisher score, a supervised filter method. Our results demonstrate that LLDA-RFE outperforms Laplacian score and shows favorable performance against SVD-entropy. It performs even better than Fisher score for some of the data sets, despite the fact that LLDA-RFE is fully unsupervised."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4450","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
