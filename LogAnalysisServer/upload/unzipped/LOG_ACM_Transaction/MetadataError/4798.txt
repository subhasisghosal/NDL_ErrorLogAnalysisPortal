The algorithms that are needed span therefore from image processing to event detection and behaviour understanding, and each of them requires dedicated study and research. In this context, sensor fusion plays a pivotal role in managing the information and improving system performance. Here we present a novel fusion framework for combining the data coming from multiple and possibly heterogeneous sensors observing a surveillance area."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25433","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3456","fieldValue":" During the visualization of 3D content, using the depth cues selectively to support the design goals and enabling a user to perceive the spatial relationships between the objects are important concerns. In this novel solution, we automate this process by proposing a framework that determines important depth cues for the input scene and the rendering methods to provide these cues. While determining the importance of the cues, we consider the user's tasks and the scene's spatial layout. The importance of each depth cue is calculated using a fuzzy logic--based decision system. Then, suitable rendering methods that provide the important cues are selected by performing a cost-profit analysis on the rendering costs of the methods and their contribution to depth perception. Possible cue conflicts are considered and handled in the system. We also provide formal experimental studies designed for several visualization tasks. A statistical analysis of the experiments verifies the success of our framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3456","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3456","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25434","fieldValue":"Huang, Jiun-Long"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25434","fieldValue":"Chiu, Shih-Chuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25434","fieldValue":"Shan, Man-Kwan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25434","fieldValue":" Score reduction is a process that arranges music for a target instrument by reducing original music. In this study we present a music arrangement framework that uses score reduction to automatically arrange music for a target instrument. The original music is first analyzed to determine the type of arrangement element of each section, then the phrases are identified and each is assigned a utility according to its type of arrangement element. For a set of utility-assigned phrases, we transform the music arrangement into an optimization problem and propose a phrase selection algorithm. The music is arranged by selecting appropriate phrases satisfying the playability constraints of a target instrument. Using the proposed framework, we implement a music arrangement system for the piano. An approach similar to Turing test is used to evaluate the quality of the music arranged by our system. The experiment results show that our system is able to create viable music for the piano."}
