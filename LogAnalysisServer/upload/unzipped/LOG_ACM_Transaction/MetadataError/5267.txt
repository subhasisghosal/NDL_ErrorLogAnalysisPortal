Microarray datasets typically contain an order of magnitude more genes than experiments, rendering many data mining methods impractical as they are optimised for sparse datasets. A new family of row-enumeration rule mining algorithms have emerged to facilitate mining in dense datasets. These algorithms rely on pruning infrequent relationships to reduce the search space by using the support measure. This major shortcoming results in the pruning of many potentially interesting rules with low support but high confidence. We propose a new row-enumeration rule mining method, MaxConf, to mine high confidence rules from microarray data. MaxConf is a support-free algorithm which directly uses the confidence measure to effectively prune the search space. Experiments on three microarray datasets show that MaxConf outperforms support-based rule mining with respect to scalability and rule extraction. Furthermore, detailed biological analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach -- the rules discovered by MaxConf are substantially more interesting and meaningful compared with support-based methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4325","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4325","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4325","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4326","fieldValue":" There is a need to design computational methods to support the prediction of gene regulatory networks. Such models should offer both biologically-meaningful and computationally-accurate predictions, which in combination with other techniques may improve large-scale, integrative studies. This paper presents a new machine learning method for the prediction of putative regulatory associations from expression data, which exhibit properties never or only partially addressed by other techniques recently published. The method was tested on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression dataset. The results were statistically validated and compared with the relationships inferred by two machine learning approaches to gene regulatory network prediction. Furthermore, the resulting predictions were assessed using domain knowledge. The proposed algorithm may be able to accurately predict relevant biological associations between genes. One of the most relevant features of this new method is the prediction of adaptive regulation thresholds for the discretization of gene expression values, which is required prior to the rule association learning process. Moreover, an important advantage consists of its low computational cost to infer association rules. The proposed system may significantly support exploratory, large-scale studies of automated identification of potentially-relevant gene expression associations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4326","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4326","fieldValue":"Combinatorial optimization, genetic regulatory networks, machine-learning, gene expression data, decision trees"}
