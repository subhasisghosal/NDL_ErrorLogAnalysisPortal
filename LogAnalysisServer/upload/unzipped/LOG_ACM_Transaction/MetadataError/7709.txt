This has spurred much activity in improving routing stability and reaction to failures and rekindled interest in centralized routing solutions, at least within a single routing domain. Centralizing decisions eliminates uncertainty and many inconsistencies and offers added flexibility in computing routes that meet different criteria. However, it also introduces new challenges, especially in reacting to failures where centralization can increase latency. This paper leverages the flexibility afforded by centralized routing to address these challenges. Specifically, we explore when and how standby backup forwarding options can be activated while waiting for an update from the centralized server after the failure of an individual component (link or node). We provide analytical insight into the feasibility of such backups as a function of network structure and quantify their computational complexity. We also develop an efficient heuristic reconciling protectability and performance, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a broad range of scenarios. The results should facilitate deployments of centralized routing solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10229","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10230","fieldValue":" The abuse of chat services by automated programs, known as chat bots, poses a serious threat to Internet users. Chat bots target popular chat networks to distribute spam and malware. In this paper, we first conduct a series of measurements on a large0 commercial chat network. Our measurements capture a total of 16 different types of chat bots ranging from simple to advanced. Moreover, we observe that human behavior is more complex than bot behavior. Based on the measurement study, we propose a classification system to accurately distinguish chat bots from human users. The proposed classification system consists of two components: 1) an entropy-based classifier; and 2) a Bayesian-based classifier. The two classifiers complement each other in chat bot detection. The entropy-based classifier is more accurate to detect unknown chat bots, whereas the Bayesian-based classifier is faster to detect known chat bots. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed classification system is highly effective in differentiating bots from humans."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10230","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8402","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
