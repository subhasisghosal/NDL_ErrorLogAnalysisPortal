{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2706","fieldValue":" We study the streaming complexity and communication complexity of approximating unweighted semi-matchings. A semi-matching in a bipartite graph G &equals; (A, B, E) with n &equals; &verbar;A&verbar; is a subset of edges SâŠ\u2020E that matches all A vertices to B vertices with the goal usually being to do this as fairly as possible. While the term semi-matching was coined in 2003 by Harvey et al. [2003], the problem had already previously been studied in the scheduling literature under different names. We present a deterministic one-pass streaming algorithm that for any 0 &les; &epsi; &les; 1 uses space $Ã\u2022(n^1+&epsi; and computes an O(n(1âˆ\u2019&epsi;)\/2)-approximation to the semi-matching problem. Furthermore, with O(log n) passes it is possible to compute an O(log n)-approximation with space Ã\u2022(n). In the one-way two-party communication setting, we show that for every &epsi; > 0, deterministic communication protocols for computing an O(n&frac;1(1+&epsi;)c+1)-approximation require a message of size more than cn bits. We present two deterministic protocols communicating n and 2n edges that compute an O&sqrt;n and an O(n1\/3$)-approximation, respectively. Finally, we improve on the results of Harvey et al. [2003] and prove new links between semi-matchings and matchings. While it was known that an optimal semi-matching contains a maximum matching, we show that there is a hierarchical decomposition of an optimal semi-matching into maximum matchings. A similar result holds for semi-matchings that do not admit length-two degree-minimizing paths."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2706","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2706","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18201","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18202","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18203","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18203","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/18204","fieldValue":"Liu, Joseph W H"}
