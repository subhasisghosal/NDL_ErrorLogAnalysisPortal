{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6923","fieldValue":" With respect to performance, asymmetric code-based cryptography based on binary Goppa codes has been reported as a highly interesting alternative to RSA and ECC. A major drawback is still the large keys in the range between 50 and 100KB that prevented real-world applications of code-based cryptosystems so far. A recent proposal by Misoczki et al. showed that quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check (QC-MDPC) codes can be used in McEliece encryption, reducing the public key to just 0.6KB to achieve an 80-bit security level. In this article, we provide optimized decoding techniques for MDPC codes and survey several efficient implementations of the QC-MDPC McEliece cryptosystem. This includes high-speed and lightweight architectures for reconfigurable hardware, efficient coding styles for ARMâ\u20AC™s Cortex-M4 microcontroller, and novel high-performance software implementations that fully employ vector instructions. Finally, we conclude that McEliece encryption in combination with QC-MDPC codes not only enables high-performance implementations but also allows for lightweight designs on a wide range of different platforms."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6923","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6923","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6923","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6924","fieldValue":"Massolino, Pedro Maat C"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6924","fieldValue":"Barreto, Paulo S L M"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6924","fieldValue":"Ruggiero, Wilson V"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6924","fieldValue":" Asymmetric cryptographic primitives are essential to enable secure communications in public networks or public mediums. Such primitives can be deployed as software libraries or hardware co-processors, the latter being more commonly employed in systems on chip (SoC) scenarios, embedded devices, or application-specific servers. Unfortunately, the most commonly available solutions, based on RSA or elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), are highly processing intensive due to the underlying extended-precision modular arithmetic. Consequently, they are not available on highly constrained platforms. Aiming to tackle this issue, we here investigate an alternative asymmetric encryption scheme that relies on lightweight arithmetic: McEliece. This scheme is especially appealing because, being based on error correction codes, it displays a simpler arithmetic and leads to better performance when compared to RSA or ECC. To evaluate the implementation of this scheme in hardware, we propose and analyze a flexible architecture whose security level and time versus area usage characteristics can be reconfigured as desired. The proposed architecture is suitable to all usual security levels, ranging from 80 to 256 bits. It is also very efficient, being able to perform data decryption with binary Goppa codes in 56Âµs with 3,402 slices on a Xilinx Spartan-3AN FPGA, whereas the best-known result in the literature for the same FPGA is 115Âµs with 7,331 slices. Alternatively, the architecture can operate with quasi-dyadic Goppa (QD-Goppa) codes, which involves smaller keys than traditional binary Goppa codes. In the latter case, for an 80-bit security level, the decryption operation can take from 1.1ms with 1,129 slices to 68Âµs with 8,268 sices. By choosing a more hardware-friendly decoding algorithm, focusing hardware resources on most bottleneck operations and sharing hardware resource for two different algorithms, better results than the those in the literature were obtained."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6924","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6924","fieldValue":"ACM"}
