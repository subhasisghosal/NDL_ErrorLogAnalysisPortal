All the results are in the w-bit word RAM model. â\u20AC\u201DIt is well known that there are linear-space data structures for 2-D orthogonal range counting with worst-case optimal query time O(log n\/log log n). We give an O(nlog log n)-space adaptive data structure that improves the query time to O(log log n + log k\/log log n), where k is the output count. When k &equals; O(1), our bounds match the state of the art for the 2-D orthogonal range emptiness problem [Chan et al., 2011]. â\u20AC\u201DWe give an O(nlog log n)-space data structure for approximate 2-D orthogonal range counting that can compute a (1 + Î\u201D)-factor approximation to the count in O(log log n) time for any fixed constant Î\u201D > 0. Again, our bounds match the state of the art for the 2-D orthogonal range emptiness problem. â\u20AC\u201DLast, we consider the 1-D range selection problem, where a query in an array involves finding the kth least element in a given subarray. This problem is closely related to 2-D 3-sided orthogonal range counting. Recently, JÃ¸rgensen and Larsen [2011] presented a linear-space adaptive data structure with query time O(log log n + log k\/log log n). We give a new linear-space structure that improves the query time to O(1 + log k\/log log n), exactly matching the lower bound proved by JÃ¸rgensen and Larsen."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2719","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2719","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18332","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18332","fieldValue":"ACM"}
