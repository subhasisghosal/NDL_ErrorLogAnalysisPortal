This article presents two discrete-time and discrete-space Markov chain-based methods, DTMC-CA and DTMC-MFT, to estimate the duration of multihop road-based paths in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET). The duration of such paths does not depend on individual nodes because packets can be forwarded by any vehicle located along the roads forming the path. DTMC-CA derives probabilistic measures based only on vehicle density for a traffic mobility model, which in this article is the microscopic Cellular Automaton (CA) freeway traffic model. DTMC-MFT generalizes the approach used by DTMC-CA to any vehicular mobility model by focusing on the macroscopic information of vehicles rather than their microscopic characteristics. The proposed analytical models produce performance-measure values comparable to simulation estimates from the validated CA traffic model. Furthermore, this article demonstrates the benefits of incorporating expected path durations into a VANET routing protocol. Simulation results show that the network overhead associated with route maintenance can be reduced to less than half by using the expected path durations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25025","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25025","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25026","fieldValue":" We develop four algorithms for simulation-based optimization under multiple inequality constraints. Both the cost and the constraint functions are considered to be long-run averages of certain state-dependent single-stage functions. We pose the problem in the simulation optimization framework by using the Lagrange multiplier method. Two of our algorithms estimate only the gradient of the Lagrangian, while the other two estimate both the gradient and the Hessian of it. In the process, we also develop various new estimators for the gradient and Hessian. All our algorithms use two simulations each. Two of these algorithms are based on the smoothed functional (SF) technique, while the other two are based on the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) method. We prove the convergence of our algorithms and show numerical experiments on a setting involving an open Jackson network. The Newton-based SF algorithm is seen to show the best overall performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25027","fieldValue":" Hit-and-run, a class of MCMC samplers that converges to general multivariate distributions, is known to be unique in its ability to mix fast for uniform distributions over convex bodies. In particular, its rate of convergence to a uniform distribution is of a low order polynomial in the dimension. However, when the body of interest is difficult to sample from, typically a hyperrectangle is introduced that encloses the original body, and a one-dimensional acceptance\/rejection is performed. The fast mixing analysis of hit-and-run does not account for this one-dimensional sampling that is often needed for implementation of the algorithm. Here we show that the effect of the size of the hyperrectangle on the efficiency of the algorithm is only a linear scaling effect. We also introduce a variation of hit-and-run that accelerates the sampler and demonstrate its capability through a computational study."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25027","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25028","fieldValue":" Simulation is a low-cost and safe alternative to solve complex problems in various areas. To promote reuse and interoperability of simulation applications and link geographically dispersed simulation components, distributed simulation was introduced. The High-Level Architecture (HLA) is the IEEE standard for distributed simulation. To optimize communication efficiency between simulation components, HLA defines a Data Distribution Management (DDM) service group for filtering out unnecessary data exchange. It relies on the computation of overlap between update and subscription regions, which is called â\u20ACœmatchingâ\u20AC?. There are many existing matching algorithms, among which a sort-based approach improves efficiency by sorting region bounds before the actual matching process, and is found to outperform other existing matching algorithms in many situations. However, the existing algorithm performs matching for all regions in one round and cannot dynamically deal with a selective region modification without processing all the regions once again. Realizing that in many spatial applications, only a small subset of all regions are actually modified in each time step, this article proposes a dynamic sort-based matching algorithm to deal with this efficiently. Theoretical analysis has been carried out for the proposed algorithm and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has significantly better performance than major existing matching algorithms at dynamic matching."}
