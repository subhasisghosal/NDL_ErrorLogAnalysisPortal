The any-to-any direct connectivity model of this technology is causing routing tables in the service provider's routers to grow very large. The concept of relaying was proposed earlier to separately minimize the routing table memory footprint of individual VPNs by selecting a small number of hub routers to maintain complete reachability information for each VPN and enabling nonhub spoke routers with reduced routing tables to reach others by routing traffic via a hub. A large service provider network typically hosts thousands of different VPNs. In this paper, we generalize relaying to the multi-VPN environment and consider new constraints on resources shared across VPNs, such as router uplink bandwidth and memory. The hub selection problem involves complex tradeoffs along multiple dimensions including these shared resources and the additional distance traversed by traffic. We formulate the hub selection as a constraint optimization problem and develop an algorithm with provable guarantees to approximate this NP-complete problem. Evaluations using traces and configurations from a large provider indicate that the resulting relaying solution reduces the total router memory requirement by 85% while smoothing out the utilization on each router and requiring only a small increase in the end-to-end path for the relayed traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10077","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10077","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10077","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10078","fieldValue":" We consider the offline version of the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem in transparent all-optical networks. In such networks and in the absence of regenerators, the signal quality of transmission degrades due to physical layer impairments. Because of certain physical effects, routing choices made for one lightpath affect and are affected by the choices made for the other lightpaths. This interference among the lightpaths is particularly difficult to formulate in an offline algorithm since, in this version of the problem, we start without any established connections and the utilization of lightpaths are the variables of the problem. We initially present an algorithm for solving the pure (without impairments) RWA problem based on a LP-relaxation formulation that tends to yield integer solutions. Then, we extend this algorithm and present two impairment-aware (IA) RWA algorithms that account for the interference among lightpaths in their formulation. The first algorithm takes the physical layer indirectly into account by limiting the impairment-generating sources. The second algorithm uses noise variance-related parameters to directly account for the most important physical impairments. The objective of the resulting cross-layer optimization problem is not only to serve the connections using a small number of wavelengths (network layer objective), but also to select lightpaths that have acceptable quality of transmission (physical layer objective). Simulations experiments using realistic network, physical layer, and traffic parameters indicate that the proposed algorithms can solve real problems within acceptable time."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10078","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10078","fieldValue":"ACM"}
