We present two prototypes and corresponding algorithms for static and programmable apertures. We also explain how these patterns can be computed at interactive rates, by taking into account the image content and limitations of the human visual system. Applications such as projector defocus compensation, high-quality projector depixelation, and increased temporal contrast of projected video sequences can be supported. Coded apertures are a step towards next-generation auto-iris projector lenses."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16340","fieldValue":" We introduce the use of fractional differentiation for simulating cloth deformations underwater. The proposed approach is able to achieve realistic underwater deformations without simulating the Eulerian body of water in which the cloth is immersed. Instead, we propose a particle-based cloth model where half-derivative viscoelastic elements are included for describing both the internal and external dynamics of the cloth. These elements model the cloth responses to fluid stresses and are also able to emulate the memory-laden behavior of particles in a viscous fluid. As a result, we obtain fractional clothes, which are able to correctly depict the dynamics of the immersed cloth interacting with the fluid even though the fluid is not simulated. The proposed approach produces realistic underwater cloth deformations and has obvious advantages in simplicity and speed of computation in comparison to volumetric fluid simulation approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16341","fieldValue":" Rephotographers aim to recapture an existing photograph from the same viewpoint. A historical photograph paired with a well-aligned modern rephotograph can serve as a remarkable visualization of the passage of time. However, the task of rephotography is tedious and often imprecise, because reproducing the viewpoint of the original photograph is challenging. The rephotographer must disambiguate between the six degrees of freedom of 3D translation and rotation, and the confounding similarity between the effects of camera zoom and dolly. We present a real-time estimation and visualization technique for rephotography that helps users reach a desired viewpoint during capture. The input to our technique is a reference image taken from the desired viewpoint. The user moves through the scene with a camera and follows our visualization to reach the desired viewpoint. We employ computer vision techniques to compute the relative viewpoint difference. We guide 3D movement using two 2D arrows. We demonstrate the success of our technique by rephotographing historical images and conducting user studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16341","fieldValue":"ACM"}
