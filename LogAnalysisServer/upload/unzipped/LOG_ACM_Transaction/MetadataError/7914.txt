We consider two types of assignment policies: without jockeying, where an arriving job is assigned only once to an available server, and with jockeying, where a job may be reassigned at any time. We also require that the underlying Markov process under each policy is insensitive. Namely, the stationary distribution of the number of jobs in the system is independent of the job size distribution except for its mean. For the case without jockeying, we derive two insensitive heuristic policies: One aims at maximizing job throughput, and the other trades off job throughput for energy efficiency. For the case with jockeying, we formulate the optimal assignment problem as a semi-Markov decision process and derive optimal policies with respect to various optimization criteria. We further derive two simple insensitive heuristic policies with jockeying: One maximizes job throughput, and the other aims at maximizing energy efficiency. Numerical examples demonstrate that, under a wide range of system parameters, the latter policy performs very close to the optimal policy. Numerical examples also demonstrate energy\/throughput tradeoffs for the various policies and, in the case with jockeying, they show a potential of substantial energy savings relative to a policy that optimizes throughput."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10642","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10642","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10642","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10643","fieldValue":" The explosive growth of cellular traffic and its highly dynamic nature often make it increasingly expensive for a cellular service provider to provision enough cellular resources to support the peak traffic demands. In this paper, we propose iDEAL, a novel auction-based incentive framework that allows a cellular service provider to leverage resources from third-party resource owners on demand by buying capacity whenever needed through reverse auctions. iDEAL has several distinctive features: 1) iDEAL explicitly accounts for the diverse spatial coverage of different resources and can effectively foster competition among third-party resource owners in different regions, resulting in significant savings to the cellular service provider. 2) iDEAL provides revenue incentives for third-party resource owners to participate in the reverse auction and be truthful in the bidding process. 3) iDEAL is provably efficient. 4) iDEAL effectively guards against collusion. 5) iDEAL effectively copes with the dynamic nature of traffic demands. In addition, iDEAL has useful extensions that address important practical issues. Extensive evaluation based on real traces from a large US cellular service provider clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. We further demonstrate the feasibility of iDEAL using a prototype implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10643","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
