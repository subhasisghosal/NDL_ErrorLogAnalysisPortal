{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21743","fieldValue":" Data compression techniques can alleviate bandwidth problems in even multigigabit networks and are especially useful when combined with encryption. This article demonstrates a reconfigurable hardware compressor\/decompressor core, the Titan-R, which can compress\/decompress data streams at 8.5 Gb\/sec, making it the fastest reconfigurable such device ever proposed; the presented full-duplex implementation allows for fully symmetric compression and decompression rates at 8.5 Gbps each. Its compression algorithm is a variation of the most widely used and efficient such scheme, the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) algorithm that uses part of the previous input stream as the dictionary. In order to support this high network throughput, the Titan-R utilizes a very fine-grained pipeline and takes advantage of the high bandwidth provided by the distributed on-chip RAMs of state-of-the-art FPGAs."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21743","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21743","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21743","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21744","fieldValue":" Remote update of hardware platforms or embedded systems is a convenient service enabled by Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based systems. This service is often essential in applications like space-based FPGA systems or set-top boxes. However, having the source of the update be remote from the FPGA system opens the door to a set of attacks that may challenge the confidentiality and integrity of the FPGA configuration, the bitstream. Existing schemes propose to encrypt and authenticate the bitstream to thwart these attacks. However, we show that they do not prevent the replay of old bitstream versions, and thus give adversaries an opportunity for downgrading the system. In this article, we propose a new architecture called sarfum that, in addition to ensuring bitstream confidentiality and integrity, precludes the replay of old bitstreams. sarfum also includes a protocol for the system designer to remotely monitor the running configuration of the FPGA. Following our presentation and analysis of the security protocols, we propose an example of implementation with the CCM (Counter with CBC-MAC) authenticated encryption standard. We also evaluate the impact of our architecture on the configuration time for different FPGA devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21744","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21745","fieldValue":"Yoo, Sang-Kyung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21745","fieldValue":" A ring oscillator-based true-random number generator design (Rings design) was introduced in Sunar et al. [2007]. The design was rigorously analyzed under a simple mathematical model and its performance characteristics were established. In this article we focus on the practical aspects of the Rings design on a reconfigurable logic platform and determine their implications on the earlier analysis framework. We make recommendations for avoiding pitfalls in real-life implementations by considering ring interaction, transistor-level effects, narrow signal rejection, transmission line attenuation, and sampler bias. Furthermore, we present experimental results showing that changing operating conditions such as the power supply voltage or the operating temperature may affect the output quality when the signal is subsampled. Hence, an attacker may shift the operating point via a simple noninvasive influence and easily bias the TRNG output. Finally, we propose modifications to the design which significantly improve its robustness against attacks, alleviate implementation-related problems, and simultaneously improve its area, throughput, and power performance."}
