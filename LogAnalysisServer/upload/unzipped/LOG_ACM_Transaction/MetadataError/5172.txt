Current technology allows Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to renegotiate contracts online to maximize profits. Changing link prices will influence interdomain routing policies that are now driven by monetary aspects as well as global resource and performance optimization. In this article, we consider an interdomain routing game in which the ISPâ\u20AC™s action is to set the price for its transit links. Assuming a cheapest path routing scheme, the optimal action is the price setting that yields the highest utility (i.e., profit) and depends both on the network load and the actions of other ISPs. We adapt a continuous and a discrete action learning automaton (LA) to operate in this framework as a tool that can be used by ISP operators to learn optimal price setting. In our model, agents representing different ISPs learn only on the basis of local information and do not need any central coordination or sensitive information exchange. Simulation results show that a single ISP employing LAs is able to learn the optimal price in a stationary environment. By introducing a selective exploration rule, LAs are also able to operate in nonstationary environments. When two ISPs employ LAs, we show that they converge to stable and fair equilibrium strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1313","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1313","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4070","fieldValue":"Dai, Li-Rong"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4070","fieldValue":"Lee, Chin-Hui"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4070","fieldValue":" We propose a novel data-driven approach to single-channel speech separation based on deep neural networks (DNNs) to directly model the highly nonlinear relationship between speech features of a mixed signal containing a target speaker and other interfering speakers. We focus our discussion on a semisupervised mode to separate speech of the target speaker from an unknown interfering speaker, which is more flexible than the conventional supervised mode with known information of both the target and interfering speakers. Two key issues are investigated. First, we propose a DNN architecture with dual outputs of the features of both the target and interfering speakers, which is shown to achieve a better generalization capability than that with output features of only the target speaker. Second, we propose using a set of multiple DNNs, each intending to be signal-noise-dependent (SND), to cope with the difficulty that one single general DNN could not well accommodate all the speaker mixing variabilities at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. Experimental results on the speech separation challenge (SSC) data demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves better separation results than other conventional approaches in a supervised or semisupervised mode. SND-DNNs could also yield significant performance improvements over a general DNN for speech separation in low SNR cases. Furthermore, for automatic speech recognition (ASR) following speech separation, this purely front-end processing with a single set of speaker-independent ASR acoustic models, achieves a relative word error rate (WER) reduction of 11.6% over a state-of-the-art separation and recognition system where a complicated joint back-end decoding framework with multiple sets of speaker-dependent ASR acoustic models needs to be implemented. When speaker-adaptive ASR acoustic models for the target speakers are adopted for the enhanced signals, another 12.1% WER reduction over our best speaker-independent ASR system is achieved."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4070","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4070","fieldValue":"ACM"}
