Current works on extracting and understanding city events mainly rely on technology-enabled infrastructure to observe and record events. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage citizen observations of various city systems and services, such as traffic, public transport, water supply, weather, sewage, and public safety, as a source of city events. We investigate the feasibility of using such textual streams for extracting city events from annotated text. We formalize the problem of annotating social streams such as microblogs as a sequence labeling problem. We present a novel training data creation process for training sequence labeling models. Our automatic training data creation process utilizes instance-level domain knowledge (e.g., locations in a city, possible event terms). We compare this automated annotation process to a state-of-the-art tool that needs manually created training data and show that it has comparable performance in annotation tasks. An aggregation algorithm is then presented for event extraction from annotated text. We carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the event annotation and event extraction on a real-world dataset consisting of event reports and tweets collected over 4 months from the San Francisco Bay Area. The evaluation results are promising and provide insights into the utility of social stream for extracting city events."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7641","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7641","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7642","fieldValue":"Dickerson, John P"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7642","fieldValue":"Hajiaghayi, Mohammad T"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7642","fieldValue":"Subrahmanian, V S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7642","fieldValue":" The use of game theory to model conflict has been studied by several researchers, spearheaded by Schelling. Most of these efforts assume a single payoff matrix that captures playersâ\u20AC™ utilities under different assumptions about what the players will do. Our experience in counterterrorism applications is that experts disagree on these payoffs. We leverage Shapleyâ\u20AC™sÂ notion of vector equilibria, which formulates games where there are multiple payoff matrices, but note that they are very hard to compute in practice. To effectively enumerate large numbers of equilibria with payoffs provided by multiple experts, we propose a novel combination of vector payoffs and well-supported &epsi;-approximate equilibria. We develop bounds related to computation of these equilibria for some special cases and give a quasipolynomial time approximation scheme (QPTAS) for the general case when the number of players is small (which is true in many real-world applications). Leveraging this QPTAS, we give efficient algorithms to find such equilibria and experimental results showing that they work well on simulated data. We then built a policy recommendation engine based on vector equilibria, called PREVE. We use PREVE to model the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks, as a five-player game. Specifically, we apply it to three payoff matrices provided by experts in India--Pakistan relations, analyze the equilibria generated by PREVE, and suggest counterterrorism policies that may reduce attacks by LeT. We briefly discuss these results and identify their strengths and weaknesses from a policy point of view."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7642","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7642","fieldValue":"ACM"}
