This final gathering step is known as the many-lights problem. Due to the large number of VPLs, computing all the VPLs' contribution is not feasible. This paper presents LightSlice, an algorithm that efficiently solves the many-lights problem for large environments with complex lighting. As in prior work, we derive our algorithm from a matrix formulation of the many-lights problem, where the contribution of each VPL corresponds to a column, and computing the final image amounts to computing the sum of all matrix columns. We make the observation that if we cluster similar surface samples together, the slice of the matrix corresponding to these surface samples has significantly lower rank than the original matrix. We exploit this observation by deriving a two-step algorithm where we first globally cluster all lights, to capture the global structure of the matrix, and then locally refine these clusters to determine the most important lights for each slice. We then reconstruct a final image from only these locally-important lights. Compared to prior work, our algorithm has the advantage of discovering and exploiting the global as well as local matrix structure, giving us a speedup of between three and six times compared to state-of-the-art algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16577","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16577","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16578","fieldValue":" Ambient occlusion and directional (spherical harmonic) occlusion have become a staple of production rendering because they capture many visually important qualities of global illumination while being reusable across multiple artistic lighting iterations. However, ray-traced solutions for hemispherical occlusion require many rays per shading point (typically 256-1024) due to the full hemispherical angular domain. Moreover, each ray can be expensive in scenes with moderate to high geometric complexity. However, many nearby rays sample similar areas, and the final occlusion result is often low frequency. We give a frequency analysis of shadow light fields using distant illumination with a general BRDF and normal mapping, allowing us to share ray information even among complex receivers. We also present a new rotationally-invariant filter that easily handles samples spread over a large angular domain. Our method can deliver 4x speed up for scenes that are computationally bound by ray tracing costs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16578","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16578","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16579","fieldValue":"Sloan, Peter-Pike"}
