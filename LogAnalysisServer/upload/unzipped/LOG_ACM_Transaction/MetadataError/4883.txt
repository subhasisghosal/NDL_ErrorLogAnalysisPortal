{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3477","fieldValue":" Creating facial animations that convey an animatorâ\u20AC™s intent is a difficult task because animation techniques are necessarily an approximation of the subtle motion of the face. Some animation techniques may result in linearization of the motion of vertices in space (blendshapes, for example), and other, simpler techniques may result in linearization of the motion in time. In this article, we consider the problem of animating smiles and explore how these simplifications in space and time affect the perceived genuineness of smiles. We create realistic animations of spontaneous and posed smiles from high-resolution motion capture data for two computer-generated characters. The motion capture data is processed to linearize the spatial or temporal properties of the original animation. Through perceptual experiments, we evaluate the genuineness of the resulting smiles. Both space and time impact the perceived genuineness. We also investigate the effect of head motion in the perception of smiles and show similar results for the impact of linearization on animations with and without head motion. Our results indicate that spontaneous smiles are more heavily affected by linearizing the spatial and temporal properties than posed smiles. Moreover, the spontaneous smiles were more affected by temporal linearization than spatial linearization. Our results are in accordance with previous research on linearities in facial animation and allow us to conclude that a model of smiles must include a nonlinear model of velocities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3477","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25670","fieldValue":"Lin, Pei-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25670","fieldValue":" Verifiability is essential for the secret sharing approach, which allows the involved participants to detect cheaters during the secret retrieval process. In this article, we propose a double verification secret sharing (DVSS) mechanism that can not only prevent fraudulent participants but also satisfy the requirements of secret payload, camouflage, image fidelity and lossless revealed secret. DVSS offers double verification process to enhance the cheater detectability; experimental results reveal that the designed scheme can share larger secret capacity and retain superior image quality than the related secret sharing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25670","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25670","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25671","fieldValue":" Over the last several decades, researches on visual object retrieval and recognition have achieved fast and remarkable success. However, while the category-level tasks prevail in the community, the instance-level tasks (especially recognition) have not yet received adequate focuses. Applications such as content-based search engine and robot vision systems have alerted the awareness to bring instance-level tasks into a more realistic and challenging scenario. Motivated by the limited scope of existing instance-level datasets, in this article we propose a new benchmark for INSTance-level visual object REtrieval and REcognition (INSTRE). Compared with existing datasets, INSTRE has the following major properties: (1) balanced data scale, (2) more diverse intraclass instance variations, (3) cluttered and less contextual backgrounds, (4) object localization annotation for each image, (5) well-manipulated double-labelled images for measuring multiple object (within one image) case. We will quantify and visualize the merits of INSTRE data, and extensively compare them against existing datasets. Then on INSTRE, we comprehensively evaluate several popular algorithms to large-scale object retrieval problem with multiple evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that all the methods suffer a performance drop on INSTRE, proving that this field still remains a challenging problem. Finally we integrate these algorithms into a simple yet efficient scheme for recognition and compare it with classification-based methods. Importantly, we introduce the realistic multiobjects recognition problem. All experiments are conducted in both single object case and multiple objects case."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25671","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25671","fieldValue":"ACM"}
