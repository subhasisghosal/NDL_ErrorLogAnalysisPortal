The availability of choice in where items are stored improves space utilization. These schemes are often very amenable to a hardware implementation, such as in a router. Recently, researchers have discovered powerful variants where items already in the hash table may be moved during the insertion of a new item. Unfortunately, these schemes occasionally require a large number of items to be moved to perform an insertion, making them inappropriate for a hardware implementation. We show that it is possible to significantly increase the space utilization of multiple-choice hashing schemes by allowing at most one item to be moved during an insertion. Furthermore, our schemes can be effectively analyzed, optimized, and compared using numerical methods based on fluid limit arguments, without resorting to much slower simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10093","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10094","fieldValue":" Dynamic allocation of resources to the best link in large multiuser networks offers considerable improvement in spectral efficiency. This gain, often referred to as multiuser diversity gain, can be cast as double-logarithmic growth of the network throughput with the number of users. In this paper, we consider large cognitive networks granted concurrent spectrum access with license-holding users. The primary network affords to share its underutilized spectrum bands with the secondary users. We assess the optimal multiuser diversity gain in the cognitive networks by quantifying how the sum-rate throughput of the network scales with the number of secondary users. For this purpose, we look at the optimal pairing of spectrum bands and secondary users, which is supervised by a central entity fully aware of the instantaneous channel conditions, and show that the throughput of the cognitive network scales double-logarithmically with the number of secondary users (N) and linearly with the number of available spectrum bands (M), i.e., M log log N. We then propose a distributed spectrum allocation scheme, which does not necessitate a central controller or any information exchange among different secondary users and still obeys the optimal throughput scaling law. This scheme requires that some secondary transmitter-receiver pairs exchange log M information bits among themselves. We also show that the aggregate amount of information exchange between secondary transmitter-receiver pairs is asymptotically equal to M log M. Finally, we show that our distributed scheme guarantees fairness among the secondary users, meaning that they are equally likely to get access to an available spectrum band."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10094","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10095","fieldValue":" Growing popularity of high-speed wireless broad-band access for real-time applications makes it increasingly relevant to study the admission control and scheduling of flows in a service differentiated manner. Next-generation wireless broadband networks employ orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technology that enables multiple users to communicate at the same time using a time-frequency grid. In this paper, we provide a mathematical model for prioritized admission control and scheduling in OFDMA-based multihop wireless networks. The problem is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP) that does joint admission control and scheduling of flows while satisfying its rate and latency requirements. We propose different heuristic algorithms for scheduling priority-based flows in centralized multihop OFDMA networks. We define the \"Flow Admittance\" (FA) metric and compare the different scheduling schemes based on this metric. Simulation results show that the Start from Frame Beginning (SFB) heuristic performs well in most of the scenarios. We also propose a combination approach that merges multiple heuristics. The FA values obtained from the combination approach are close to the ILP while incurring computation time orders of lower magnitude."}
