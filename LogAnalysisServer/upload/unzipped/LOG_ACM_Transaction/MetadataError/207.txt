The relationship between the satisfiability of metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas over continuous-time models and over discrete-time models is studied. It is shown to what extent discrete-time sequences obtained by sampling continuous-time signals capture the semantics of MTL formulas over the two time domains. The main results apply to â\u20ACœflatâ\u20AC? formulas that do not nest temporal operators and can be applied to the problem of reducing the verification problem for MTL over continuous-time models to the same problem over discrete time, resulting in an automated partial practically efficient discretization technique."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11599","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11599","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11600","fieldValue":" Infons are statements viewed as containers of information (rather then representations of truth values). The logic of infons turns out to be a conservative extension of logic known as constructive or intuitionistic. Distributed Knowledge Authorization Language uses additional unary connectives â\u20ACœp saidâ\u20AC? and â\u20ACœp impliedâ\u20AC? where p ranges over principals. Here we investigate infon logic and a narrow but useful primal fragment of it. In both cases, we develop model theory and analyze the derivability problem: Does the given query follow from the given hypotheses&quest; Our more involved technical results are on primal infon logic. We construct an algorithm for the multiple derivability problem: Which of the given queries follow from the given hypotheses&quest; Given a bound on the quotation depth of the hypotheses, the algorithm runs in linear time. We quickly discuss the significance of this result for access control."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11600","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11601","fieldValue":" A data word is a sequence of pairs of a letter from a finite alphabet and an element from an infinite set, where the latter can only be compared for equality.

The same complexity bounds are obtained for satisfiability and refinement, respectively, for the safety fragment of linear temporal logic with freeze quantification.
