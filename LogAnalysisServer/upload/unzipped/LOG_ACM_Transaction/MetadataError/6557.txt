However, POMDPs need appropriate representations to become tractable in ITSs that model many learner features, such as mastery of individual skills or the presence of specific misconceptions. This article describes two POMDP representationsâ\u20AC\u201Dstate queues and observation chainsâ\u20AC\u201Dthat take advantage of ITS task properties and let POMDPs scale to represent over 100 independent learner features. A real-world military training problem is given as one example. A human study (n = 14) provides initial validation for the model construction. Finally, evaluating the experimental representations with simulated students helps predict their impact on ITS performance. The compressed representations can model a wide range of simulated problems with instructional efficacy equal to lossless representations. With improved tractability, POMDP ITSs can accommodate more numerous or more detailed learner states and inputs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7471","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7471","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7472","fieldValue":" Sharing resources and information on the Internet has become an important activity for education. In distance learning, instructors can benefit from resources, also known as Learning Objects (LOs), to create plenteous materials for specific learning purposes. Our repository (called the MINE Registry) has been developed for storing and sharing learning objects, around 22,000 in total, in the past few years. To enhance reusability, one significant concept named Reusability Tree was implemented to trace the process of changes. Also, weighting and ranking metrics have been proposed to enhance the searchability in the repository. Following the successful implementation, this study goes further to investigate the relationships between LOs from a perspective of social networks. The LONET (Learning Object Network), as an extension of Reusability Tree, is newly proposed and constructed to clarify the vague reuse scenario in the past, and to summarize collaborative intelligence through past interactive usage experiences. We define a social structure in our repository based on past usage experiences from instructors, by proposing a set of metrics to evaluate the interdependency such as prerequisites and references. The structure identifies usage experiences and can be graphed in terms of implicit and explicit relations among learning objects. As a practical contribution, an adaptive algorithm is proposed to mine the social structure in our repository. The algorithm generates adaptive routes, based on past usage experiences, by computing possible interactive input, such as search criteria and feedback from instructors, and assists them in generating specific lectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7472","fieldValue":"SCORM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7472","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7472","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7473","fieldValue":" A novel intelligent interface eases the browsing of Web documents written in the second languages of users. It automatically predicts words unfamiliar to the user by a collective intelligence method and glosses them with their meaning in advance. If the prediction sì³®ds, the user does not need to consult a dictionary; even if it fails, the user can correct the prediction. The correction data are collected and used to improve the accuracy of further predictions. The prediction is personalized in that every user's language ability is estimated by a state-of-the-art language testing model, which is trained in a practical response time with only a small sacrifice of prediction accuracy. The system was evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy and reading simulation. The reading simulation results show that this system can reduce the number of clicks for most readers with insufficient vocabulary to read documents and can significantly reduce the remaining number of unfamiliar words after the prediction and glossing for all users."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7473","fieldValue":"ACM"}
