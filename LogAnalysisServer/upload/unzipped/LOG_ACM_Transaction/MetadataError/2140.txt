We present an interactive technique for surface reconstruction from incomplete and sparse scans of 3D objects possessing sharp features. A fundamental premise of our interaction paradigm is that directly editing data in 3D is not only counterintuitive but also ineffective, while working with 1D entities (i.e., curves) is a lot more manageable. To this end, we factor 3D editing into two \"orthogonal\" interactions acting on skeletal and profile curves of the underlying shape, controlling its topology and geometric features, respectively. For surface completion, we introduce a novel skeleton-driven morph-to-fit, or morfit, scheme which reconstructs the shape as an ensemble of generalized cylinders. Morfit is a hybrid operator which optimally interpolates between adjacent curve profiles (the \"morph\") and snaps the surface to input points (the \"fit\"). The interactive reconstruction iterates between user edits and morfit to converge to a desired final surface. We demonstrate various interactive reconstructions from point scans with sharp features and significant missing data."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17205","fieldValue":"Morfit: interactive surface reconstruction from incomplete point clouds with curve-driven topology and geometry control"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17205","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17206","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17206","fieldValue":" We present a quality-driven, Poisson-guided autonomous scanning method. Unlike previous scan planning techniques, we do not aim to minimize the number of scans needed to cover the object's surface, but rather to ensure the high quality scanning of the model. This goal is achieved by placing the scanner at strategically selected Next-Best-Views (NBVs) to ensure progressively capturing the geometric details of the object, until both completeness and high fidelity are reached. The technique is based on the analysis of a Poisson field and its geometric relation with an input scan. We generate a confidence map that reflects the quality\/fidelity of the estimated Poisson iso-surface. The confidence map guides the generation of a viewing vector field, which is then used for computing a set of NBVs. We applied the algorithm on two different robotic platforms, a PR2 mobile robot and a one-arm industry robot. We demonstrated the advantages of our method through a number of autonomous high quality scannings of complex physical objects, as well as performance comparisons against state-of-the-art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17206","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17206","fieldValue":"ACM"}
