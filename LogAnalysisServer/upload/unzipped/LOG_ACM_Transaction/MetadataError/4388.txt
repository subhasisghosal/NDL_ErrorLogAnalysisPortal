We maintain that capturing the intrinsic relations among multiple information sources is important for predicting stock trends. The challenge lies in modeling the complex space of various sources and types of information and studying the effects of this information on stock market behavior. For this purpose, we introduce a tensor-based information framework to predict stock movements. Specifically, our framework models the complex investor information environment with tensors. A global dimensionality-reduction algorithm is used to capture the links among various information sources in a tensor, and a sequence of tensors is used to represent information gathered over time. Finally, a tensor-based predictive model to forecast stock movements, which is in essence a high-order tensor regression learning problem, is presented. Experiments performed on an entire year of data for China Securities Index stocks demonstrate that a trading system based on our framework outperforms the classic Top-N trading strategy and two state-of-the-art media-aware trading algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24144","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24145","fieldValue":" In electricity customer classification, the most important task is to avoid the curse of dimensionality problem, as the consumption diagrams have a large number of dimensions. To avoid the curse of dimensionality problem, field indices (load shape factor) are often used instead of consumption diagrams. Field indices are directly extracted from consumption diagrams according to a predefined formula. Previous studies show that the most important thing for defining such a formula is to find meaningful time intervals from consumption diagrams. However, the inconvenient thing is that there are still a lack of details to explain how to define such time intervals. In our study, we propose a data mining--based method named SFATIE to support the extraction of field indices. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing it with other dimensionality reduction methods during the classification. For the classification, most often we have used classification methods like C5.0, SVM, Neural Net, Bayes Net, and Logistic. The experimental results show that our method is better or close to other dimensionality reduction methods. In addition, the experimental results show that our proposed method can produce the good quality of field indices and that these indices can improve the performance of electricity customer classification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24145","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24145","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24146","fieldValue":" Rapid advances in mobile devices and cloud-based music service now allow consumers to enjoy music anytime and anywhere. Consequently, there has been an increasing demand in studying intelligent techniques to facilitate context-aware music recommendation. However, one important context that is generally overlooked is userâ\u20AC™s venue, which often includes surrounding atmosphere, correlates with activities, and greatly influences the userâ\u20AC™s music preferences. In this article, we present a novel venue-aware music recommender system called VenueMusic to effectively identify suitable songs for various types of popular venues in our daily lives. Toward this goal, a Location-aware Topic Model (LTM) is proposed to (i) mine the common features of songs that are suitable for a venue type in a latent semantic space and (ii) represent songs and venue types in the shared latent space, in which songs and venue types can be directly matched. It is worth mentioning that to discover meaningful latent topics with the LTM, a Music Concept Sequence Generation (MCSG) scheme is designed to extract effective semantic representations for songs. An extensive experimental study based on two large music test collections demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed topic model and MCSG scheme. The comparisons with state-of-the-art music recommender systems demonstrate the superior performance of VenueMusic system on recommendation accuracy by associating venue and music contents using a latent semantic space. This work is a pioneering study on the development of a venue-aware music recommender system. The results show the importance of considering the influence of venue types in the development of context-aware music recommender systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24146","fieldValue":"ACM"}
