It uses semantics-preserving code transformations to generate diverse executables, periodically restarting servers with these fresh versions. The periodic restarts help bound the number of compromised replicas that a service ever concurrently runs, and therefore proactive obfuscation makes an adversary's job harder. Proactive obfuscation was used in implementing two prototypes: a distributed firewall based on state-machine replication and a distributed storage service based on quorum systems. Costs intrinsic to supporting proactive obfuscation in replicated systems were evaluated by measuring the performance of these prototypes. The results show that employing proactive obfuscation adds little to the cost of replica-management protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12339","fieldValue":" Total order broadcast is a fundamental communication primitive that plays a central role in bringing cheap software-based high availability to a wide range of services. This article studies the practical performance of such a primitive on a cluster of homogeneous machines. We present LCR, the first throughput optimal uniform total order broadcast protocol. LCR is based on a ring topology. It only relies on point-to-point inter-process communication and has a linear latency with respect to the number of processes. LCR is also fair in the sense that each process has an equal opportunity of having its messages delivered by all processes. We benchmark a C implementation of LCR against Spread and JGroups, two of the most widely used group communication packages. LCR provides higher throughput than the alternatives, over a large number of scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12340","fieldValue":"Musuloiu-Elefteri, Raluca"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12340","fieldValue":" Wireless mesh networks extend the connectivity range of mobile devices by using multiple access points, some of them connected to the Internet, to create a mesh topology and forward packets over multiple wireless hops. However, the quality of service provided by the mesh is impaired by the delays and disconnections caused by handoffs, as clients move within the area covered by multiple access points. We present the architecture and protocols of SMesh, the first transparent wireless mesh system that offers seamless, fast handoff, supporting real-time applications such as interactive VoIP. The handoff and routing logic is done solely by the access points, and therefore connectivity is attainable by any 802.11 device. In SMesh, the entire mesh network is seen by the mobile clients as a single, omnipresent access point, giving the mobile clients the illusion that they are stationary. We use multicast for access points coordination and, during handoff transitions, we use more than one access point to handle the moving client. SMesh provides a hybrid routing protocol that optimizes routes over wireless and wired links in a multihomed environment. Experimental results on a fully deployed mesh network demonstrate the effectiveness of the SMesh architecture and its intra-domain and inter-domain handoff protocols."}
