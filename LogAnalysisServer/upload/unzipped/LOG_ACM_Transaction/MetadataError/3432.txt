Instead of organizing objects a priori, it allows humans to search for and locate them as needed. Designed for the following objectives: (i) human-centric operation, (ii) privacy, and (iii) efficient searching of any tagged object, MAX provides location information in a form natural to humans, that is, with reference to identifiable landmarks (such as, â\u20ACœon the dining tableâ\u20AC?) rather than precise coordinates. In the system, all physical objectsâ\u20AC\u201Dfrom documents to clothingâ\u20AC\u201Dcan be tagged, users then locate objects using an intuitive search interface. To make searching efficient, MAX adopts a hierarchical architecture consisting of tags (bound to objects), substations (bound to landmarks), and base-stations (bound to localities). Tags can be marked as either public or private, with private tags searchable only by the owner. MAX also provides for privacy of physical spaces. It requires minimal initial configuration, and is robust to reconfiguration of the physical space. We also present a methodology to design energy-optimal and delay-optimal query protocols for a variety of device choices, this optimizes system performance, and affords insight into the appropriate actions for various scenarios. We have implemented a simple prototype of MAX, demonstrating the feasibility of the system for human-centric search over several locations across a wide area. We contend that a MAX-like search system will enable sharing (e.g., books on a college campus) and trading (e.g., buying and selling used books) of physical resources, and will be the engine for a host of new applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21252","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3026","fieldValue":" This article proposes a novel reordering method for efficient two-step Japanese-to-English statistical machine translation (SMT) that isolates reordering from SMT and solves it after lexical translation. This reordering problem, called post-ordering, is solved as an SMT problem from Head-Final English (HFE) to English. HFE is syntax-based reordered English that is very successfully used for reordering with English-to-Japanese SMT. The proposed method incorporates its advantage into the reverse direction, Japanese-to-English, and solves the post-ordering problem by accurate syntax-based SMT with target language syntax. Two-step SMT with the proposed post-ordering empirically reduces the decoding time of the accurate but slow syntax-based SMT by its good approximation using intermediate HFE. The proposed method improves the decoding speed of syntax-based SMT decoding by about six times with comparable translation accuracy in Japanese-to-English patent translation experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21253","fieldValue":" Cooperative node localization schemes that employ nonlinear data reduction often deliver higher network node position accuracy compared to many other approaches. Other advantages of such algorithms are that they require only a minimum number of anchor nodes (if we require absolute locations) and that they can be applied under both range-based and range-free conditions. This article presents a novel cooperative node localization scheme, applying an efficient neural network nonlinear projection method called Curvilinear Component Analysis (CCA). A thorough comparative performance study of the proposed scheme in different mission-critical operational network scenarios is conducted. Compared with another leading cooperative node localization algorithm, MDS-MAP, which employs Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), the proposed CCA-MAP approach significantly improves position estimate accuracy in many of the scenarios. We also propose a new local edge model for range-free distance matrix approximation that considerably enhances the performance for both MDS-MAP and CCA-MAP in certain irregular network configurations which are very challenging for node positioning."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21253","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21253","fieldValue":"ACM"}
