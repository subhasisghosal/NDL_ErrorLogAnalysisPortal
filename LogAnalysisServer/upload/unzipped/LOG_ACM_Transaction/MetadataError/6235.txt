Three-dimension (3D) CMP architecture has been studied recently for integrating more functionalities and providing higher performance. The high temperature on chip is a critical issue for the 3D architecture. In this article, we propose an online thermal prediction model for 3D chips. Using this model, we propose novel task scheduling algorithms based on rotation scheduling to reduce the peak temperature on chip. We consider data dependencies, especially inter-iteration dependencies that are not well considered in most of the current thermal-aware task scheduling algorithms. Our simulation results show that our algorithms can efficiently reduce the peak temperature up to $8.1^Ë\u2020$C."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6620","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6620","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6621","fieldValue":"Chen, Bo-Wei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6621","fieldValue":"Wang, Jhing-Fa"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6621","fieldValue":" In this study, we present a video search and indexing system based on the state support vector (SVM) network, video graph, and reinforcement agent for recognizing and organizing video events. In order to enhance the recognition performance of the state SVM network, two innovative techniques are presented: state transition correction and transition quality estimation. The classification results are also merged into the video indexing graph, which facilitates the search speed. A reinforcement algorithm with an efficient scheduling scheme significantly reduces both the power consumption and time. The experimental results show the proposed state SVM network was able to achieve a precision rate as high as 83.83&percnt; and the query results of the indexing graph reached 80&percnt; accuracy. The experiments also demonstrate the performance and feasibility of our system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6621","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6621","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6622","fieldValue":" In this article, we present a wearable intelligence device for activity monitoring applications. We developed and evaluated algorithms to recognize physical activities from data acquired using a 3-axis accelerometer with a single camera worn on a body. The recognition process is performed in two steps: at first the features for defining a human activity are measured by the 3-axis accelerometer sensor and the image sensor embedded in a wearable device. Then, the physical activity corresponding to the measured features is determined by applying the SVM classifier. The 3-axis accelerometer sensor computes the correlation between axes and the magnitude of the FFT for other features of an activity. Acceleration data is classified into nine activity labels. Through the image sensor, multiple optical flow vectors computed on each grid image patch are extracted as features for defining an activity. In the experiments, we showed that an overall accuracy rate of activity recognition based our method was 92.78&percnt;."}
