{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10768","fieldValue":" We consider a simple MAC protocol, called the renewal access protocol (RAP), that adopts all of the legacy 802.11 standard but the backoff stage feature. To meet two objectives in the design of the RAP---optimal throughput and high short-term fairness---we develop a mathematical model of the RAP and rigorously analyze the performance of the RAP. First, we show that the throughput performance of the RAP depends only on the expectation of the selection distribution where the backoff counter is selected, provided that the number of terminals is fixed, which is in accordance with a well-known result. Second, with the help of renewal and reliability theories, we analyze the short-term fairness of the RAP. We also show that if the RAP has a selection distribution of the New Better than Used in Expectation (NBUE) type, the RAP can guarantee high short-term fairness. Third, we construct a special binomial distribution that is obviously of the NBUE type that can achieve high short-term fairness as well as optimal throughput when used as the selection distribution of the RAP. Furthermore, by the Poisson approximation for binomial distributions, we propose to use in practice a Poisson distribution corresponding to the special binomial distribution. Numerical and simulation results are provided to validate our analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10768","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10768","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10768","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10769","fieldValue":"Jacobsen, Hans-Arno"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10769","fieldValue":" We study delivering delay-sensitive data to a group of receivers with minimum latency. This latency consists of the time that the data spends in overlay links as well as the delay incurred at each overlay node, which has to send out a piece of data several times over a finite-capacity network connection. The latter part is a significant portion of the total delay as we show in the paper, yet it is often ignored or only partially addressed by previous multicast algorithms. We analyze the actual delay in multicast trees and consider building trees with minimum-average and minimum-maximum delay. We show the NP-hardness of these problems and prove that they cannot be approximated in polynomial time to within any reasonable approximation ratio. We then present a set of algorithms to build minimum-delay multicast trees that cover a wide range of application requirements---min-average and min-max delay, for different scales, real-time requirements, and session characteristics. We conduct comprehensive experiments on different real-world datasets, using various overlay network models. The results confirm that our algorithms can achieve much lower delays (up to 60% less) and up to orders-of-magnitude faster running times (i.e., supporting larger scales) than previous related approaches."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10769","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10769","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10769","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10770","fieldValue":" In current peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming systems, nodes in a channel form a P2P overlay for video sharing. To watch a new channel, a node depends on the centralized server to join in the overlay of the channel. In today's live streaming applications, the increase in the number of channels triggers users' desire of watching multiple channels successively or simultaneously. However, the support of such watching modes in current applications is no better than joining in different channel overlays successively or simultaneously through the centralized server, which if widely used, poses a heavy burden on the server. In order to achieve higher efficiency and scalability, we propose a Social-network-Aided efficient liVe strEaming system (SAVE). SAVE regards users' channel switching or multichannel watching as interactions between channels. By collecting the information of channel interactions, nodes' interests, and watching times, SAVE forms nodes in multiple channels with frequent interactions into an overlay, constructs bridges between overlays of channels with less frequent interactions, and enables nodes to identify friends sharing similar interests and watching times. Thus, a node can connect to a new channel while staying in its current overlay, using bridges or relying on its friends, reducing the need to contact the centralized server. We further propose the channel-closeness-based chunk-pushing strategy and capacity-based chunk provider selection strategy to enhance the system performance. Extensive experimental results from the PeerSim simulator and PlanetLab verify that SAVE outperforms other systems in system efficiency and server load reduction, as well as the effectiveness of the two proposed strategies."}
