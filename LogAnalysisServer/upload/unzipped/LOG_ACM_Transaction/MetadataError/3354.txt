To reflect the factors affecting prosodic phrasing in the model, linguistically motivated machine-learning features were investigated. These features were effectively incorporated using a stacking model. The phrasing performance was also improved through feature engineering. The corpus used in the experiment is a 4,392-sentence corpus (55,015 words with an average of 13 words per sentence). Because the corpus contains speaker-dependent variability and such variability is not appropriately reflected in a general purpose speech synthesis system, a method to reduce such variability is proposed. In addition, the entire set of data used in the experiment is provided to the public for future use in comparative research."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3006","fieldValue":"Stacking Model-Based Korean Prosodic Phrasing Using Speaker Variability Reduction and Linguistic Feature Engineering"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3006","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3006","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21004","fieldValue":"Chang, Yuan-Hao"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21004","fieldValue":"Hsu, Ping-Yi"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21004","fieldValue":"Lu, Yung-Feng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21004","fieldValue":"Kuo, Tei-Wei"}
