Usually it is described as a Markov chain modeling a specific random surfer. In this article, an alternative representation as a power series is given. Nonetheless, it is possible to interpret the values as probabilities in a random surfer setting, differing from the usual one.Using the new description we restate and extend some results concerning the convergence of the standard iteration used for PageRank. Furthermore we take a closer look at sinks and sources, leading to some suggestions for faster implementations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24337","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24338","fieldValue":"Jnsson, Bjrn r"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24338","fieldValue":"rsson, Bjarnsteinn"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24338","fieldValue":" The emergence of query-based online data services and e-commerce applications has prompted much recent research on data caching. This article studies semantic caching, a caching architecture for such applications, that caches the results of selection queries. The primary contribution of this article is to revisit the performance and overhead of semantic caching using a modern database server and modern hardware. Initially, the performance study focuses on simple workloads and demonstrates several benefits of semantic caching, including low overhead, insensitivity to the physical layout of the database, reduced network traffic, and the ability to answer some queries without contacting the server. With moderately complex workloads, careful coding of remainder queries is required to maintain efficient query processing at the server. Using very complex workloads, we demonstrate that semantic caching works well in a range of applications, especially in network-constrained environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24338","fieldValue":"ACM"}
