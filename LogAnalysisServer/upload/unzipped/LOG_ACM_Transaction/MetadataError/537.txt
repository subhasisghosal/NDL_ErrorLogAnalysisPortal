This may involve measuring sensors and controlling actuators, communicating with other systems, or interacting with users. These functions impose real-time constraints on system design. Verification of these specifications requires computing an upper bound on the worst-case execution time (WCET) of a hardware\/software system. Furthermore, it is critical to derive a tight upper bound on WCET in order to make efficient use of system resources. The problem of bounding WCET is particularly difficult on modern processors. These processors use cache-based memory systems that vary memory access time based on the dynamic memory access pattern of the program. This must be accurately modeled in order to tightly bound WCET. Several analysis methods have been proposed to bound WCET on processors with instruction caches. Existing approaches either search all possible program paths, an intractable problem, or they use highly pessimistic assumptions to limit the search space. In this paper we present a more effective method for modeling instruction cache activity and computing a tight bound on WCET. The method uses an integer linear programming formulation and does not require explicit enumeration of program paths. The method is implemented in the program cinderella and we present some experimental results of this implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12754","fieldValue":"Shi, C-J Richard"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12754","fieldValue":" An interval-mathematic approach is presented for frequency-domain simulation and sensitivity analysis of linear analog circuits under parameter variations. With uncertain parameters represented as intervals, bounding frequency-domain responses is formulated as the problem of solving systems of linear interval equations. The formulation is based on a variant of modified nodal analysis, and is particularly amenable to interval analysis. Some characterization of the solution sets of systems of linear interval equations are derived. With these characterizations, an elegant and efficient algorithm is proposed to solve systems of linear interval equations. While the widely used Monte Carlo approach requires many circuit simulations to achieve even moderate accuracy, the computational cost of the proposed approach is about twice that of one circuit simulation. The computed response bounds contain provably, or are usually very close to, the actual response bounds. Further, sensitivity under parameter variations can be computed from the response bounds at minor computational cost. The algorithms are implemented in SPICE3F5, using sparse-matrix techniques and tested on several practical analog circuits."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12754","fieldValue":"Simulation and sensitivity of linear analog circuits under parameter variations by Robust interval analysis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12754","fieldValue":"ACM"}
