These can be used to extract 3D geometries for simulations of organ development. To solve models on growing domains, the displacement fields between consecutive image frames need to be determined. Here we develop and evaluate different landmark-free algorithms for the determination of such displacement fields from image data. In particular, we examine minimal distance, normal distance, diffusion-based, and uniform mapping algorithms and test these algorithms with both synthetic and real data in 2D and 3D. We conclude that in most cases, the normal distance algorithm is the method of choice and wherever it fails, diffusion-based mapping provides a good alternative."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25120","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25120","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25121","fieldValue":" The problem of gene regulatory network inference is a major concern of systems biology. In recent years, a novel methodology has gained momentum, called community network approach. Community networks integrate predictions from individual methods in a â\u20ACœmetapredictor,â\u20AC? in order to compose the advantages of different methods and soften individual limitations. This article proposes a novel methodology to integrate prediction ensembles using constraint programming, a declarative modeling and problem solving paradigm. Constraint programming naturally allows the modeling of dependencies among components of the problem as constraints, facilitating the integration and use of different forms of knowledge. The new paradigm, referred to as constrained community network, uses constraints to capture properties of the regulatory networks (e.g., topological properties) and to guide the integration of knowledge derived from different families of network predictions. The article experimentally shows the potential of this approach: The addition of biological constraints can offer significant improvements in prediction accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25121","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25121","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25122","fieldValue":" Based on the theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, the inherent randomness of biochemical reaction networks can be described by discrete-state continuous-time Markov chains. However, the analysis of such processes is computationally expensive and sophisticated numerical methods are required. Here, we propose an analysis framework in which we integrate a number of moments of the process instead of the state probabilities. This results in a very efficient simulation of the time evolution of the process. To regain the state probabilities from the moment representation, we combine the fast moment-based simulation with a maximum entropy approach for the reconstruction of the underlying probability distribution. We investigate the usefulness of this combined approach in the setting of stochastic chemical kinetics and present numerical results for three reaction networks showing its efficiency and accuracy. Besides a simple dimerization system, we study a bistable switch system and a multiattractor network with complex dynamics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25122","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25122","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25123","fieldValue":" This article defines a novel spatial-temporal modelling and analysis methodology applied to a systems biology case study, namely phase variation patterning in bacterial colony growth. We employ coloured stochastic Petri nets to construct the model and run stochastic simulations to record the development of the circular colonies over time and space. The simulation output is visualised in 2D, and sector-like patterns are automatically detected and analysed. Space is modelled using 2.5 dimensions considering both a rectangular and circular geometry, and the effects of imposing different geometries on space are measured. We close by outlining an interpretation of the Petri net model in terms of finite difference approximations of partial differential equations (PDEs). One result is the derivation of the â\u20ACœbestâ\u20AC? nine-point diffusion model. Our multidimensional modelling and analysis approach is a precursor to potential future work on more complex multiscale modelling."}
