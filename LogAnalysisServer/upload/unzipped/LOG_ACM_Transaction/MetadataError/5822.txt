Predicting the functional types of membrane proteins is indispensable to the characterization of membrane proteins. Recent studies have extended to predicting single- and multi-type membrane proteins. However, existing predictors perform poorly and more importantly, they are often lack of interpretability. To address these problems, this paper proposes an efficient predictor, namely Mem-mEN, which can produce sparse and interpretable solutions for predicting membrane proteins with single- and multi-label functional types. Given a query membrane protein, its associated gene ontology GO information is retrieved by searching a compact GO-term database with its homologous accession number, which is subsequently classified by a multi-label elastic net EN classifier. Experimental results show that Mem-mEN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art membrane-protein predictors. Moreover, by using Mem-mEN, 338 out of more than 7,900 GO terms are found to play more essential roles in determining the functional types. Based on these 338 essential GO terms, Mem-mEN can not only predict the functional type of a membrane protein, but also explain why it belongs to that type.
