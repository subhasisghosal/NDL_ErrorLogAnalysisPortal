{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7751","fieldValue":" Intelligent technologies have become an essential part of music systems and applications. This is evidenced by today's omnipresence of digital online music stores and streaming services, which rely on music recommenders, automatic playlist generators, and music browsing interfaces. A large amount of research leading to intelligent music applications deals with the extraction of musical and acoustic information directly from the audio signal using signal processing techniques. Other strategies exploit contextual aspects of music, not present in the signal, for example, community meta-data and trails of user interaction, as found, for instance, on social media platforms. In this editorial, we discuss the notion of â\u20ACœintelligent music systemâ\u20AC? and give an overview of the papers selected to this special issue."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/7751","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan (Yang, Yi-Hsuan); Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria (Schedl, Markus); Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Escola Superior de M&#250;sica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain (Herrera-Boyer, Perfecto)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7751","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7752","fieldValue":" Most works in automatic music generation have addressed so far specific tasks. Such a reductionist approach has been extremely successful and some of these tasks have been solved once and for all. However, few works have addressed the issue of generating automatically fully fledged music material, of human-level quality. In this article, we report on a specific experiment in holistic music generation: the reorchestration of Beethovenâ\u20AC™s Ode to Joy, the European anthem, in seven styles. These reorchestrations were produced with algorithms developed in the Flow Machines project and within a short time frame. We stress the benefits of having had such a challenging and unifying goal, and the interesting problems and challenges it raised along the way."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7752","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7753","fieldValue":" This text offers a personal and very subjective view on the current situation of Music Information Research (MIR).
