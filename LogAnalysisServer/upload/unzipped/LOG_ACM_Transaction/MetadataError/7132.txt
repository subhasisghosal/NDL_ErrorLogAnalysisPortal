In particular, we emphasize that the cooperative game (also called the bargaining problem) provides an overall picture for the issue. With a simple model for Internet quality of service (QoS), we demonstrate that the leader-follower game may lead to a solution that is not Pareto optimal and in some cases may be \"unfair,\" and that the cooperative game may provide a better solution for both the Internet service provider (ISP) and the user. The practical implication of the results is that government regulation or arbitration may be helpful. The QoS model is also applied to study the competition between two ISPs, and we find a Nash equilibrium point from which the two ISPs would not move out without cooperation. The proposed approaches can be applied to other Internet pricing problems such as the Paris Metro pricing scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9087","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9087","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9087","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9087","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9088","fieldValue":" For a multiplexer fed by a large number of sources, we derive conditions under which a given subset of the sources can be substituted for a single source while preserving the buffer overflow probability and the dominant timescales of buffer overflows. This notion of traffic equivalence is stronger than simple effective bandwidth equality and depends on the multiplexing context. We propose several applications of the above traffic substitution conditions. First, we show that fractional Brownian motion as a single source substitute can effectively model a large number of multiplexed sources using information obtained purely from traffic traces; this has direct application to simple but accurate traffic generation. Second, we focus on dynamic (i.e., on-line) estimation of available capacity and buffer overflow probability. This requires the solution of a double optimization problem expressed in terms of functions whose values are obtained from time averages of the traffic traces over a large range of timescales. We show how to solve this problem on-line by reducing it to the calculation of a fixed-point equation that can be solved iteratively by combining traffic substitution using fractional Brownian motion with dynamic measurements of the actual traffic. We have validated this approach by extensive experimentation with large numbers or real traffic sources that are fed to a high bandwidth link, and comparing our on-line estimation of available capacity and the resulting dynamic call admission control with other existing approaches. The superior accuracy of our approach also suggests that taking the buffer size into account, as does our on-line algorithm, may be vital for achieving approximations of practical interest."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9088","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
