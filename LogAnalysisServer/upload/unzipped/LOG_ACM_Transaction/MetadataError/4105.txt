However, it is not easy to retrieve this material with the search engines currently available. This study produced a specialized search assistant based on Google that significantly increases the number of instances in which teachers find the desired learning objects as compared to using this popular public search engine directly. Success in finding learning objects by study participants went from 80&percnt; using Google alone to 96&percnt; when using our search assistant in one scenario and, in another scenario, from a 40&percnt; success rate with Google alone to 66&percnt; with our assistant. This specialized search assistant implements features such as bilingual search and term suggestion which were requested by teacher participants to help improve their searches. Study participants evaluated the specialized search assistant and found it significantly easier to use and more useful than the popular search engine for the purpose of finding learning objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23239","fieldValue":"WWW"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23239","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23239","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3267","fieldValue":" Simple, low-level visual features are extensively used for content-based image retrieval. Our goal was to evaluate an image-indexing system based on some of the known properties of the early stages of human vision. We quantitatively measured the relationship between the similarity order induced by the indexes and perceived similarity. In contrast to previous evaluation approaches, we objectively measured similarity both for the few best-matching images and also for relatively distinct images. The results show that, to a large degree, the rank orders induced by the indexes predict the perceived similarity between images. The highest index concordance employing a single index was obtained using the chromaticity histogram. Combining different information sources substantially improved the correspondence with the observers. We conclude that image-indexing systems can provide useful measures for perceptual image similarity. The methods presented here can be used to evaluate and compare different image-retrieval systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23240","fieldValue":" User browsing information, particularly non-search-related activity, reveals important contextual information on the preferences and intents of Web users. In this article, we demonstrate the importance of mining general Web user behavior data to improve ranking and other Web-search experience, with an emphasis on analyzing individual user sessions for creating aggregate models. In this context, we introduce ClickRank, an efficient, scalable algorithm for estimating Webpage and Website importance from general Web user-behavior data. We lay out the theoretical foundation of ClickRank based on an intentional surfer model and discuss its properties. We quantitatively evaluate its effectiveness regarding the problem of Web-search ranking, showing that it contributes significantly to retrieval performance as a novel Web-search feature. We demonstrate that the results produced by ClickRank for Web-search ranking are highly competitive with those produced by other approaches, yet achieved at better scalability and substantially lower computational costs. Finally, we discuss novel applications of ClickRank in providing enriched user Web-search experience, highlighting the usefulness of our approach for nonranking tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23240","fieldValue":"ACM"}
