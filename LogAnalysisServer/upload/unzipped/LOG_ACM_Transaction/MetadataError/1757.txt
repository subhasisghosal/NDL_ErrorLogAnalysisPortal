We incorporate several state-of-the-art techniques from multigrid theory, while adapting them to the specific requirements of graphics and animation applications, such as the ability to handle elaborate geometry and complex boundary conditions. Our method supports simulation of linear elasticity and corotational linear elasticity. The efficiency of our solver is practically independent of material parameters, even for near-incompressible materials. We achieve simulation rates as high as 6 frames per second for test models with 256K vertices on an 8-core SMP, and 1.6 frames per second for a 2M vertex object on a 16-core SMP."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16230","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16231","fieldValue":"Chiang, Jen-Yuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16231","fieldValue":" We present a novel technique for acquiring detailed facial geometry of a dynamic performance using extended spherical gradient illumination. Key to our method is a new algorithm for jointly aligning two photographs, under a gradient illumination condition and its complement, to a full-on tracking frame, providing dense temporal correspondences under changing lighting conditions. We employ a two-step algorithm to reconstruct detailed geometry for every captured frame. In the first step, we coalesce information from the gradient illumination frames to the full-on tracking frame, and form a temporally aligned photometric normal map, which is subsequently combined with dense stereo correspondences yielding a detailed geometry. In a second step, we propagate the detailed geometry back to every captured instance guided by the previously computed dense correspondences. We demonstrate reconstructed dynamic facial geometry, captured using moderate to video rates of acquisition, for every captured frame."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16232","fieldValue":"Sillion, Franois X"}
