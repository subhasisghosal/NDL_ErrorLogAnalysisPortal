In many cases, the regularity and the correlation of those patterns is problematic: For network applications, many connected users create peaks of demand; in contrast, in peer-to-peer scenarios, having few users online results in a scarcity of available resources. On the other hand, since connectivity patterns exhibit a periodic behavior, they are to some extent predictable. This paper shows how this can be exploited to anticipate future user connectivity and to have applications proactively responding to it. We evaluate the probability that any given user will be online at any given time, and assess the prediction on 6-month availability traces from three different Internet applications. Building upon this, we show how our probabilistic approach makes it easy to evaluate and optimize the performance in a number of diverse network application models and to use them to optimize systems. In particular, we show how this approach can be used in distributed hash tables, friend-to-friend storage, and cache preloading for social networks, resulting in substantial gains in data availability and system efficiency at negligible costs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10793","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10793","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10793","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10794","fieldValue":" In the last decade, many studies have used the Internet autonomous system (AS)-level topology to perform several analyses, from discovering its graph properties to assessing its impact on the effectiveness of worm-containment strategies. Yet, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) data used to reveal the topologies are far from complete. Our contribution is threefold. First, we analyze BGP data currently gathered by the most famous route collector projects, highlighting and explaining the causes of their incompleteness. We found that large areas of the Internet are not properly captured due to the geographical location of route collector feeders and due to BGP filters, such as export policies and decision processes. Second, we propose a methodology based on a new metric, named p2c-distance, which is able to: 1) identify the minimum number of ASs required to obtain an Internet AS-level topology that is closer to reality; and 2) identify a ranking list of these ASs to show that it is possible to obtain nonnegligible coverage improvements with a limited number of appropriately chosen feeding ASs. Third, we characterize the ASs that were found to be part of the solution of the above covering problems. We found that the route collectors are rarely connected to these ASs, thus highlighting that much effort is needed to devise a route collector infrastructure that ideally would be able to capture a complete view of the Internet."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10794","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10794","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10794","fieldValue":"ACM"}
