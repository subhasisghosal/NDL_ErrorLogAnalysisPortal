We explore the potential of deploying proxy caches in different Autonomous Systems (ASes) with the goal of reducing the cost incurred by Internet service providers and alleviating the load on the Internet backbone. We conduct an eight-month measurement study to analyze the P2P traffic characteristics that are relevant to caching, such as object popularity, popularity dynamics, and object size. Our study shows that the popularity of P2P objects can be modeled by a Mandelbrot-Zipf distribution, and that several workloads exist in P2P traffic. Guided by our findings, we develop a novel caching algorithm for P2P traffic that is based on object segmentation, and proportional partial admission and eviction of objects. Our trace-based simulations show that with a relatively small cache size, a byte hit rate of up to 35% can be achieved by our algorithm, which is close to the byte hit rate achieved by an off-line optimal algorithm with complete knowledge of future requests. Our results also show that our algorithm achieves a byte hit rate that is at least 40% more, and at most triple, the byte hit rate of the common web caching algorithms. Furthermore, our algorithm is robust in face of aborted downloads, which is a common case in P2P systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9791","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9791","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9792","fieldValue":" Server selection plays an essential role in content replication networks, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks (CDNs). In this paper, we perform an analytical investigation of the strengths and weaknesses of existing server selection policies, based initially on an M\/G\/1 Processor Sharing (PS) queueing-theoretic model. We develop a theoretical benchmark to evaluate the performance of two general server selection policies, referred to as EQ_DELAY and EQ_LOAD, which characterize a wide range of existing server selection algorithms. We find that EQ_LOAD achieves an average delay always higher than or equal to that of EQ_DELAY. A key theoretical result of this paper is that in an N-server system, the worst case ratio between the average delay of EQ_DELAY or EQ_LOAD and the minimal average delay (obtained from the benchmark) is precisely N. We constructively show how this worst case scenario can arise in highly heterogeneous systems. This result, when interpreted in the context of selfish routing, means that the price of anarchy in unbounded delay networks depends on the topology, and can potentially be very large. Our analytical findings are extended in asymptotic regimes to the G\/G\/1 First-Come First-Serve and multi-class M\/G\/1-PS models and supported by simulations run for various arrival and service processes, scheduling disciplines, and workload exhibiting temporal locality. These results indicate that our analysis is applicable to realistic scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9792","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9792","fieldValue":"ACM"}
