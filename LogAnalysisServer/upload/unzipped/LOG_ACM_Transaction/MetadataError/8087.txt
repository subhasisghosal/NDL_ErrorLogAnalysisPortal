Each packet transmission can be overheard by a random subset of receiver nodes among which the next relay is selected opportunistically. The main challenge in the design of minimum-delay routing policies is balancing the trade-off between routing the packets along the shortest paths to the destination and distributing the traffic according to the maximum backpressure. Combining important aspects of shortest path and backpressure routing, this paper provides a systematic development of a distributed opportunistic routing policy with congestion diversity (D-ORCD). D-ORCD uses a measure of draining time to opportunistically identify and route packets along the paths with an expected low overall congestion. D-ORCD with single destination is proved to ensure a bounded expected delay for all networks and under any admissible traffic, so long as the rate of computations is sufficiently fast relative to traffic statistics. Furthermore, this paper proposes a practical implementation of D-ORCD which empirically optimizes critical algorithm parameters and their effects on delay as well as protocol overhead. Realistic QualNet simulations for 802.11-based networks demonstrate a significant improvement in the average delay over comparable solutions in the literature."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10977","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10977","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10977","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10978","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of resource allocation and control of multihop networks in which multiple source-destination pairs communicate confidential messages, to be kept confidential from the intermediate nodes. We pose the problem as that of network utility maximization, into which confidentiality is incorporated as an additional quality of service constraint. We develop a simple, and yet provably optimal dynamic control algorithm that combines flow control, routing and end-to-end secrecy-encoding. In order to achieve confidentiality, our scheme exploits multipath diversity and temporal diversity due to channel variability. Our end-to-end dynamic encoding scheme encodes confidential messages across multiple packets, to be combined at the ultimate destination for recovery. We first develop an optimal dynamic policy for the case in which the number of blocks across which secrecy encoding is performed is asymptotically large. Next, we consider encoding across a finite number of packets, which eliminates the possibility of achieving perfect secrecy. For this case, we develop a dynamic policy to choose the encoding rates for each message, based on the instantaneous channel state information, queue states and secrecy outage requirements. By numerical analysis, we observe that the proposed scheme approaches the optimal rates asymptotically with increasing block size. Finally, we address the consequences of practical implementation issues such as infrequent queue updates and decentralized scheduling. We demonstrate the efficacy of our policies by numerical studies under various network conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10978","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
