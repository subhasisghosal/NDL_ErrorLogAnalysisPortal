After discussing three basic polygon clipping algorithms, a different approach is proposed, explaining the principles of a new algorithm and presenting it step by step.An example implementation of the algorithm is given along with some results. A comparison between the proposed method, the Liang and Barsky algorithm, and the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm is also given, showing performances up to eight times the speed of the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm, and up to three times the Liang and Barsky algorithm. The algorithm proposed here can use floating point or integer operations; this can be useful for fast or simple implementations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15072","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15072","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2424","fieldValue":" We present algorithms for finding optimal strategies for discounted, infinite-horizon, Determinsitc Markov Decision Processes (DMDPs).

We also present a randomized O(m1\/2n2)-time algorithm for finding Discounted All-Pairs Shortest Paths (DAPSP), improving an O(mn2$)-time algorithm that can be obtained using ideas of Papadimitriou and Tsitsiklis &lsqb;1987&rsqb;."}
