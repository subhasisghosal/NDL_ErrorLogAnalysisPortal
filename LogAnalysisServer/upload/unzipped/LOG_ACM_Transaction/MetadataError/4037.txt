{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23018","fieldValue":" This research investigates the design and performance of the Speech Graffiti interface for spoken interaction with simple machines. Speech Graffiti is a standardized interface designed to address issues inherent in the current state-of-the-art in spoken dialog systems such as high word-error rates and the difficulty of developing natural language systems. This article describes the general characteristics of Speech Graffiti, provides examples of its use, and describes other aspects of the system such as the development toolkit. We also present results from a user study comparing Speech Graffiti with a natural language dialog system. These results show that users rated Speech Graffiti significantly better in several assessment categories. Participants completed approximately the same number of tasks with both systems, and although Speech Graffiti users often took more turns to complete tasks than natural language interface users, they completed tasks in slightly less time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23019","fieldValue":" Previous work demonstrated that Web counts can be used to approximate bigram counts, suggesting that Web-based frequencies should be useful for a wide variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, only a limited number of tasks have so far been tested using Web-scale data sets. The present article overcomes this limitation by systematically investigating the performance of Web-based models for several NLP tasks, covering both syntax and semantics, both generation and analysis, and a wider range of n-grams and parts of speech than have been previously explored. For the majority of our tasks, we find that simple, unsupervised models perform better when n-gram counts are obtained from the Web rather than from a large corpus. In some cases, performance can be improved further by using backoff or interpolation techniques that combine Web counts and corpus counts. However, unsupervised Web-based models generally fail to outperform supervised state-of-the-art models trained on smaller corpora. We argue that Web-based models should therefore be used as a baseline for, rather than an alternative to, standard supervised models."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/23019","fieldValue":"<i>n<\/i>-gram models"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23019","fieldValue":"<i>n<\/i>-gram models"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23019","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23019","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3245","fieldValue":"Edwards, Alistair D N"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3245","fieldValue":" When the visual channel of communication is unavailable because the user is blind, nonvisual user interfaces must be developed. The proposed methodology consists of three interrelated specification levels. Information and supported tasks are specified in abstract terms at the conceptual level, taking into account requirements imposed by manipulation of interaction devices and information provided by analysis of the visual representation. The perceptual structure of the auditory scene is specified next at the structural level and then the physical dimensions of sound are defined at the implementation level. The methodology is applied to the specification of a simple listbox widget."}
