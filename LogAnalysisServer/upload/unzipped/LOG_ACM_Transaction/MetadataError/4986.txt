Acoustic and context-dependent cross-lingual articulatory features (AFs) are incorporated into the estimation of the distance between triphone units for constructing a Chinese-English phone set. The acoustic features of each triphone in the training corpus are extracted for constructing an acoustic triphone HMM. Furthermore, the articulatory features of the \"last\/first\" state of the corresponding preceding\/sì³®ding triphone in the training corpus are used to construct an AF-based GMM. The AFs, extracted using a deep neural network (DNN), are used for code-switching articulation modeling to alleviate the data sparseness problem due to the diverse context-dependent phone combinations in intra-sentential code-switching. The triphones are then clustered to obtain a Chinese-English phone set based on the acoustic HMMs and the AF-based GMMs using a hierarchical triphone clustering algorithm. Experimental results on code-switching ASR show that the proposed method for phone set construction outperformed other traditional methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3646","fieldValue":"Chinese-English phone set construction for code-switching ASR using acoustic and DNN-extracted articulatory features"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3646","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3646","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1275","fieldValue":"Lopez-Sanchez, Maite"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1275","fieldValue":"Rodrguez-Aguilar, Juan A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1275","fieldValue":" Adaptive organisation-centred multi-agent systems can dynamically modify their organisational components to better accomplish their goals. Our research line proposes an abstract distributed architecture (2-LAMA) to endow an organisation with adaptation capabilities. This article focuses on regulation-adaptation based on a machine learning approach, in which adaptation is learned by applying a tailored case-based reasoning method. We evaluate the robustness of the system when it is populated by non compliant agents. The evaluation is performed in a peer-to-peer sharing network scenario. Results show that our proposal significantly improves system performance and can cope with regulation violators without incorporating any specific regulation-compliance enforcement mechanisms."}
