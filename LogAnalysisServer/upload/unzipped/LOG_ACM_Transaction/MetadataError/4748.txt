In this article we present our experience with designing and implementing a data management infrastructure for a distributed immersive performance (DIP) application. The DIP project investigates a versatile framework for the capture, recording, and replay of video, audio, and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) streams in an interactive environment for collaborative music performance. We are focusing on two classes of data streams that are generated within this environment. The first category consists of high-resolution isochronous media streams, namely audio and video. The second class comprises MIDI data produced by electronic instruments. MIDI event sequences are alphanumeric in nature and fall into the category of the data streams that have been of interest to data management researchers in recent years. We present our data management architecture, which provides a repository for all DIP data. Streams of both categories need to be acquired, transmitted, stored, and replayed in real time. Data items are correlated across different streams with temporal indices. The audio and video streams are managed in our own High-performance Data Recording Architecture (HYDRA), which integrates multistream recording and retrieval in a consistent manner. This paper reports on the practical issues and challenges that we encountered during the design, implementation and experimental phases of our prototype. We also present some analysis results and discuss future extensions for the architecture."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25309","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3444","fieldValue":"Katz, Brian F G"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3444","fieldValue":" Situated in the context of multimedia browsing, this study concerns perceptual processes involved in searching for an audiovisual object displayed among several distractors. The aim of the study is to increase the perceptual saliency of the target in order to enhance the search process. As blurring distractors and maintaining the target sharp has proved to be a great facilitator of visual search, we propose combining visual blur with an audio blur analogue to improve multimodal search. Three perceptual experiments were performed in which participants had to retrieve an audiovisual object from a set of six competing stimuli. The first two experiments explored the effect of blur level on unimodal search tasks. A third experiment investigated the influence of an audio and visual modality combination with both modalities cued on an audiovisual search task. Results showed that both visual and audio blurs render stimuli distractors less prominent and thus helped users focus on a sharp target more easily. Performances were also faster and more accurate in the bimodal condition than in either unimodal search task, auditory or visual. Our work suggests that audio and audiovisual interfaces dedicated to multimedia search could benefit from different uses of blur on presentation strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/3444","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2465780.2465781\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3444","fieldValue":"ACM"}
