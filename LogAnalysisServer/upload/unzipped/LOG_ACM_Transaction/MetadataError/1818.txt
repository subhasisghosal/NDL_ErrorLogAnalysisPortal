Cengiz"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16381","fieldValue":" A central problem in computer graphics is finding optimal sampling conditions for a given surface representation. We propose a new method to solve this problem based on spectral analysis of manifolds which results in faithful reconstructions and high quality isotropic samplings, is efficient, out-of-core, feature sensitive, intuitive to control and simple to implement. We approach the problem in a novel way by utilizing results from spectral analysis, kernel methods, and matrix perturbation theory. Change in a manifold due to a single point is quantified by a local measure that limits the change in the Laplace-Beltrami spectrum of the manifold. Hence, we do not need to explicitly compute the spectrum or any global quantity, which makes our algorithms very efficient. Although our main focus is on sampling surfaces, the analysis and algorithms are general and can be applied for simplifying and resampling point clouds lying near a manifold of arbitrary dimension."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16381","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16381","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16382","fieldValue":" High-dimensional Gaussian filters, most notably the bilateral filter, are important tools for many computer graphics and vision tasks. In recent years, a number of techniques for accelerating their evaluation have been developed by exploiting the separability of these Gaussians. However, these techniques do not apply to the more general class of spatially varying Gaussian filters, as they cannot be expressed as convolutions. These filters are useful because the underlying data---e.g. images, range data, meshes or light fields---often exhibit strong local anisotropy and scale. We propose an acceleration method for approximating spatially varying Gaussian filters using a set of spatially invariant Gaussian filters each of which is applied to a segment of some non-disjoint partitioning of the dataset. We then demonstrate that the resulting ability to locally tilt, rotate or scale the kernel improves filtering performance in various applications over traditional spatially invariant Gaussian filters, without incurring a significant penalty in computational expense."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16382","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16382","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16383","fieldValue":" Computational highlight holography converts three-dimensional computer models into mechanical \"holograms\" fabricated on (specular) reflective or refractive materials. The surface consists of small grooves with patches of paraboloids or hyperboloids, each of which produces a highlight when illuminated by a directional light. Each highlight appears in different places for different view directions, with the correct binocular and motion parallax corresponding to a virtual 3D point position. Our computational pipeline begins with a 3D model and desired view position, samples the model to generate points that depict its features accurately, and computes a maximal set of non-overlapping patches to be embedded in the surface. We provide a preview of the hologram for the user, then fabricate the surface using a computer-controlled engraving machine. We show a variety of different fabricated holograms: reflective, transmissive, and holograms with color and proper shading. We also present extensions to stationary and animated 2D stippled images."}
