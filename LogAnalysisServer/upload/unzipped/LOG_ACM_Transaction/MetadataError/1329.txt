{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15123","fieldValue":" We extend an earlier automatic motion-synthesis algorithm for physically realistic articulated figures in several ways. First, we summarize several incremental improvements to the original algorithm that improve its efficiency significantly and provide the user with some ability to influence what motions are generated. These techniques can be used by an animator to achieve a desired movement style, or they can be used to guarantee variety in the motions synthesized over several runs of the algorithm. Second, we report on new mechanisms that support the concatenation of existing, automatically generated motion controllers to produce complex, composite movement. Finally, we describe initial work on generalizing the techniques from 2D to 3D articulated figures. Taken together, these results illustrate the promise and challenges afforded by the controller-based approach to automatic motion synthesis for computer animation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15123","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15123","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15124","fieldValue":" In this paper we introduce B-spline illumination maps and their generalizations and extensions for use in realistic image generation algorithms. The B-spline lighting functions (i.e., illumination maps) are defined as weighted probability density functions. The lighting functions can be estimated from random data and may be used in bidirectional distributed ray tracing programs as well as radiosity oriented algorithms. The use of these lighting functions in a bidirectional ray tracing system that can handle dispersion as well as the focusing of light through lenses is presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15124","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15124","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15125","fieldValue":"De Floriani, Leila"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15125","fieldValue":" A new hierarchical triangle-based model for representing surfaces over sampled data is proposed, which is based on the subdivision of the surface domain into nested triangulations, called a hierarchical triangulation (HT). The model allows compression of spatial data and representation of a surface at successively finer degrees of resolution. An HT is a collection of triangulations organized in a tree, where each node, except for the root, is a triangulation refining a face belonging to its parent in the hierarchy. We present a topological model for representing an HT, and algorithms for its construction and for the extraction of a triangulation at a given degree of resolution. The surface model, called a hierarchical triangulated surface (HTS) is obtained by associating data values with the vertices of triangles, and by defining suitable functions that describe the surface over each triangular patch. We consider an application of a piecewise-linear version of the HTS to interpolate topographical data, and we describe a specialized version of the construction algorithm that builds an HTS for a terrain starting from a high-resolution rectangular grid of sampled data. Finally, we present an algorithm for extracting representations of terrain at variable resolution over the domain."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15125","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15125","fieldValue":"ACM"}
