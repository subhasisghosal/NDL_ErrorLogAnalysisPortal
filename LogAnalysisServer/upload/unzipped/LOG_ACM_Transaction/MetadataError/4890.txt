{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3479","fieldValue":" Stimuli obtained from highly dynamic 3D virtual environments and synchronous eye-tracking data are commonly used by algorithms that strive to correlate gaze to scene objects, a process referred to as gaze-to-object mapping (GTOM). We propose to address this problem with a probabilistic approach using Bayesian inference. The desired result of the inference is a predicted probability density function (PDF) specifying for each object in the scene a probability to be attended by the user. To evaluate the quality of a predicted attention PDF, we present a methodology to assess the information value (i.e., likelihood) in the predictions of different approaches that can be used to infer object attention. To this end, we propose an experiment based on a visual search task, which allows us to determine the object of attention at a certain point in time under controlled conditions. We perform this experiment with a wide range of static and dynamic visual scenes to obtain a ground-truth evaluation dataset, allowing us to assess GTOM techniques in a set of 30 particularly challenging cases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3479","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25688","fieldValue":"Lin, Yin-Tzu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25688","fieldValue":"Liu, I-Ting"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25688","fieldValue":"Jang, Jyh-Shing Roger"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25688","fieldValue":"Wu, Ja-Ling"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25688","fieldValue":" This article proposes a framework for creating user-preference-aware music medleys from users' music collections. We treat the medley generation process as an audio version of a musical dice game. Once the user's collection has been analyzed, the system is able to generate various pleasing medleys. This flexibility allows users to create medleys according to the specified conditions, such as the medley structure or the must-use clips. Even users without musical knowledge can compose medley songs from their favorite tracks. The effectiveness of the system has been evaluated through both objective and subjective experiments on individual components in the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25688","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25688","fieldValue":"ACM"}
