These technologies allow researchers to deploy networks of automated sensors, which can monitor a landscape at very fine temporal and spatial scales. However, these networks are subject to harsh conditions, which lead to malfunctions in individual sensors and failures in network communications. The resulting data streams often exhibit incorrect data measurements and missing values. Identifying and correcting these is time-consuming and error-prone. We present a method for real-time automated data quality control (QC) that exploits the spatial and temporal correlations in the data to distinguish sensor failures from valid observations. The model adapts to each deployment site by learning a Bayesian network structure that captures spatial relationships between sensors, and it extends the structure to a dynamic Bayesian network to incorporate temporal correlations. This model is able to flag faulty observations and predict the true values of the missing or corrupt readings. The performance of the model is evaluated on data collected by the SensorScope Project. The results show that the spatiotemporal model demonstrates clear advantages over models that include only temporal or only spatial correlations, and that the model is capable of accurately imputing corrupted values."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21363","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21363","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21364","fieldValue":" In this article we propose a lightweight algorithm for constructing multiresolution data representations for sensor networks. At each sensor node u, we compute O(log n) aggregates about exponentially enlarging neighborhoods centered at u. The ith aggregate is the aggregated data from nodes approximately within 2i hops of u. We present a scheme, named the hierarchical spatial gossip algorithm, to extract and construct these aggregates, for all sensors simultaneously, with a total communication cost of O(n polylog n). The hierarchical gossip algorithm adopts atomic communication steps with each node choosing to exchange information with a node distance d away with probability ∼ $1\/d^3$. The attractiveness of the algorithm can be attributed to its simplicity, low communication cost, distributed nature, and robustness to node failures and link failures. We show in addition that computing multiresolution aggregates precisely (i.e., each aggregate uses all and only the nodes within 2i hops) requires a communication cost of Ω(n√n), which does not scale well with network size. An approximate range in aggregate computation like that introduced by the gossip mechanism is therefore necessary in a scalable efficient algorithm. Besides the natural applications of multiresolution data summaries in data validation and information mining, we also demonstrate the application of the precomputed multiresolution data summaries in answering range queries efficiently."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21364","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21364","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21365","fieldValue":" Recent work has shown that, despite the minimal information provided by a binary proximity sensor, a network of these sensors can provide remarkably good target tracking performance. In this article, we examine the performance of such a sensor network for tracking multiple targets. We begin with geometric arguments that address the problem of counting the number of distinct targets, given a snapshot of the sensor readings. We provide necessary and sufficient criteria for an accurate target count in a one-dimensional setting, and provide a greedy algorithm that determines the minimum number of targets that is consistent with the sensor readings. While these combinatorial arguments bring out the difficulty of target counting based on sensor readings at a given time, they leave open the possibility of accurate counting and tracking by exploiting the evolution of the sensor readings over time. To this end, we develop a particle filtering algorithm based on a cost function that penalizes changes in velocity. An extensive set of simulations, as well as experiments with passive infrared sensors, are reported. We conclude that, despite the combinatorial complexity of target counting, probabilistic approaches based on fairly generic models of trajectories yield respectable tracking performance."}
