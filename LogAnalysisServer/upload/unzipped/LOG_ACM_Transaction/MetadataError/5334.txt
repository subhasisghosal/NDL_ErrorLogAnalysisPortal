The interactions between residue clusters serve as potential nucleation sites in the folding process. Evidence postulates that the residue interactions are governed by the hydrophobic propensities that the residues possess. An array of hydrophobicity scales has been developed to determine the hydrophobic propensities of residues under different environmental conditions. In this work, we propose a graph-theory-based data mining framework to extract and isolate protein structural features that sustain invariance in evolutionary-related proteins, through the integrated analysis of five well-known hydrophobicity scales over the 3D structure of proteins. We hypothesize that proteins of the same homology contain conserved hydrophobic residues and exhibit analogous residue interaction patterns in the folded state. The results obtained demonstrate that discriminatory residue interaction patterns shared among proteins of the same family can be employed for both the structural and the functional annotation of proteins. We obtained on the average 90 percent accuracy in protein classification with a significantly small feature vector compared to previous results in the area. This work presents an elaborate study, as well as validation evidence, to illustrate the efficacy of the method and the correctness of results reported."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4453","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4453","fieldValue":"Bioinformatics (genome or protein) databases, data mining, hydrophobicity scales, protein folding, structural classification, subgraph mining."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4453","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4453","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4454","fieldValue":" The study of gene functions requires high-quality DNA libraries. However, a large number of tests and screenings are necessary for compiling such libraries. We describe an algorithm for extracting as much information as possible from pooling experiments for library screening. Collections of clones are called pools, and a pooling experiment is a group test for detecting all positive clones. The probability of positiveness for each clone is estimated according to the outcomes of the pooling experiments. Clones with high chance of positiveness are subjected to confirmatory testing. In this paper, we introduce a new positive clone detecting algorithm, called the Bayesian network pool result decoder (BNPD). The performance of BNPD is compared, by simulation, with that of the Markov chain pool result decoder (MCPD) proposed by Knill et al. in 1996. Moreover, the combinatorial properties of pooling designs suitable for the proposed algorithm are discussed in conjunction with combinatorial designs and d\\hbox{-}{\\rm disjunct} matrices. We also show the advantage of utilizing packing designs or BIB designs for the BNPD algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4454","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
