Its supernodal Cholesky factorization relies on LAPACK and the Level-3 BLAS, and obtains a substantial fraction of the peak performance of the BLAS. Both real and complex matrices are supported. CHOLMOD is written in ANSI\/ISO C, with both C and MATLABTM$ interfaces. It appears in MATLAB 7.2 as xâ\u20AC\u2030=â\u20AC\u2030A\\b when A is sparse symmetric positive definite, as well as in several other sparse matrix functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19227","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19227","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19228","fieldValue":"Drake, John B"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19228","fieldValue":"DAzevedo, Eduardo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19228","fieldValue":" A collection of MATLAB classes for computing and using spherical harmonic transforms is presented. Methods of these classes compute differential operators on the sphere and are used to solve simple partial differential equations in a spherical geometry. The spectral synthesis and analysis algorithms using fast Fourier transforms and Legendre transforms with the associated Legendre functions are presented in detail. A set of methods associated with a spectral_field class provides spectral approximation to the differential operators âˆ\u2021 &ctdot;, âˆ\u2021 Ã\u2014, âˆ\u2021, and $âˆ\u2021^2$ in spherical geometry. Laplace inversion and Helmholtz equation solvers are also methods for this class. The use of the class and methods in MATLAB is demonstrated by the solution of the barotropic vorticity equation on the sphere. A survey of alternative algorithms is given and implementations for parallel high performance computers are discussed in the context of global climate and weather models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19228","fieldValue":"ACM"}
