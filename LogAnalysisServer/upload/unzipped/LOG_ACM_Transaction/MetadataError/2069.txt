{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17020","fieldValue":" We propose a novel method for detecting mesh saliency, a perceptually-based measure of the importance of a local region on a 3D surface mesh. Our method incorporates global considerations by making use of spectral attributes of the mesh, unlike most existing methods which are typically based on local geometric cues. We first consider the properties of the log-Laplacian spectrum of the mesh. Those frequencies which show differences from expected behaviour capture saliency in the frequency domain. Information about these frequencies is considered in the spatial domain at multiple spatial scales to localise the salient features and give the final salient areas. The effectiveness and robustness of our approach are demonstrated by comparisons to previous approaches on a range of test models. The benefits of the proposed method are further evaluated in applications such as mesh simplification, mesh segmentation, and scan integration, where we show how incorporating mesh saliency can provide improved results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17020","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17020","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17021","fieldValue":" We investigate the application of exponential integrators to stiff elastodynamic problems governed by second-order differential equations. Classical explicit numerical integration schemes have the shortcoming that the stepsizes are limited by the highest frequency that occurs within the solution spectrum of the governing equations, while implicit methods suffer from an inevitable and mostly uncontrollable artificial viscosity that often leads to a nonphysical behavior. In order to overcome these specific detriments, we devise an appropriate class of exponential integrators that solve the stiff part of the governing equations of motion by employing a closed-form solution. As a consequence, we are able to handle up to three orders of magnitude larger time-steps as with conventional implicit integrators and at the same time achieve a tremendous increase in the overall long-term stability due to a strict energy conservation. The advantageous behavior of our approach is demonstrated on a broad spectrum of complex deformable models like fibers, textiles, and solids, including collision response, friction, and damping."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17021","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17021","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17022","fieldValue":"Morel, Jean-Michel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17022","fieldValue":" This article proposes a new multiscale filter accelerating Monte Carlo renderer. Each pixel in the image is characterized by the colors of the rays that reach its surface. The proposed filter uses a statistical distance to compare with each other the ray color distributions associated with different pixels, at each scale. Based on this distance, it decides whether two pixels can share their rays or not. This simple and easily reproducible algorithm provides a psnr gain of 10 to 15 decibels, or equivalently accelerates the rendering process by using 10 to 30 times fewer samples without observable bias. The algorithm is consistent, does not assume a particular noise model, and is immediately extendable to synthetic movies. Being based on the ray color values only, it can be combined with all rendering effects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17022","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17022","fieldValue":"ACM"}
