However, mitigating an FPGAâ\u20AC™s susceptibility to single-event upset (SEU) radiation is challenging. Triple-modular redundancy (TMR) techniques are traditionally used to mitigate radiation effects, but TMR incurs substantial overheads such as increased area and power requirements. In order to reduce these overheads while still providing sufficient radiation mitigation, we propose a reconfigurable fault tolerance (RFT) framework that enables system designers to dynamically adjust a systemâ\u20AC™s level of redundancy and fault mitigation based on the varying radiation incurred at different orbital positions. This framework includes an adaptive hardware architecture that leverages FPGA reconfigurable techniques to enable significant processing to be performed efficiently and reliably when environmental factors permit. To accurately estimate upset rates, we propose an upset rate modeling tool that captures time-varying radiation effects for arbitrary satellite orbits using a collection of existing, publically available tools and models. We perform fault-injection testing on a prototype RFT platform to validate the RFT architecture and RFT performability models. We combine our RFT hardware architecture and the modeled upset rates using phased-mission Markov modeling to estimate performability gains achievable using our framework for two case-study orbits."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21823","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21823","fieldValue":"Reconfigurable Fault Tolerance: A Comprehensive Framework for Reliable and Adaptive FPGA-Based Space Computing"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21823","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21823","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21824","fieldValue":"Bartolini, Davide B"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21824","fieldValue":"Santambrogio, Marco D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21824","fieldValue":" Traditionally, hardware circuits are realized according to techniques that follow the classical phases of design and testing. A completely new approach in the creation of hardware circuits has been proposed---the Evolvable Hardware (EHW) paradigm, which bases the circuit synthesis on a goal-oriented evolutionary process inspired by biological evolution in Nature. FPGA-based approaches have emerged as the main architectural solution to implement EHW systems. Various EHW systems have been proposed by researchers but most of them, being based on outdated chips, do not take advantage of the interesting features introduced in newer FPGAs. This article describes a project named Hardware Evolution over Reconfigurable Architectures (HERA), which aims at creating a complete and performance-oriented framework for the evolution of digital circuits, leveraging the reconfiguration technology available in FPGAs. The project is described from its birth to its current state, presenting its evolutionary technique tailored for FPGA-based circuits and the most recent enhancements to improve the scalability with respect to problem size. The developed EHW system outperforms the state of the art, proving its effectiveness in evolving both standard benchmarks and more complex real-world applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21824","fieldValue":"ACM"}
