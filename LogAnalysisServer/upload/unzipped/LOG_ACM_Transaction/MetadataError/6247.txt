Ideally, we may run a MCISS in parallel to enhance the simulation speed. However, the conventional centralized timing synchronization mechanism would greatly constrain the parallelism of a MCISS, so the simulation speed is bounded. To resolve this issue, we propose a new distributed timing synchronization technique which allows higher parallelism for a MCISS. Hence, it accelerates the simulation speed by 9 to 20 times as the number of cores increases in contrast to the centralized synchronization approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/6650","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2435227.2435250\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6650","fieldValue":"ACM"}
