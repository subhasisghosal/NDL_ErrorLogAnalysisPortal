{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3846","fieldValue":" A class of low-complexity compressive sensing-based direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods for wideband co-prime arrays is proposed. It is based on a recently proposed narrowband estimation method, where a virtual array model is generated by directly vectorizing the covariance matrix and then using a sparse signal recovery method to obtain the estimation result. As there are a large number of redundant entries in both the auto-correlation and cross-correlation matrices of the two sub-arrays, they can be combined together to form a model with a significantly reduced dimension, thereby leading to a solution with much lower computational complexity without sacrificing performance. A further reduction in complexity is achieved by removing noise power estimation from the formulation. Then, the two proposed low-complexity methods are extended to the wideband realm utilizing a group sparsity based signal reconstruction method. A particular advantage of group sparsity is that it allows a much larger unit inter-element spacing than the standard co-prime array and therefore leads to further improved performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3847","fieldValue":"Chien, Yu-Ren"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3847","fieldValue":"Wang, Hsin-Min"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3847","fieldValue":"Jeng, Shyh-Kang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3847","fieldValue":" This paper presents a novel approach to extraction of vocal melodies from accompanied singing recordings. Central to our approach is a model of vocal fundamental frequency (F0) likelihood that integrates acoustic-phonetic knowledge and real-world data. This model consists of a timbral fitness score and a loudness measure of each F0 candidate. Timbral fitness is measured for the partial amplitudes of an F0 candidate, with respect to a small set of vocal timbre examples. This F0-specific measurement of timbral fitness depends on an acoustic-phonetic F0 modification of each timbre example. In the loudness part of the likelihood model, sinusoids are detected, tracked, and pruned to give loudness values that minimize interference from the accompaniment. A final F0 estimate is determined by a prior model of F0 sequence in addition to the likelihood model. Melody extraction is completed by detecting voiced time positions according to the singing voice loudness variations given by the estimated F0 sequence. The numerical parameters involved in our approach were optimized on three development sets from different sources before the system was evaluated on ten test sets separate from these development sets. Controlled experiments show that use of the timbral fitness score accounts for a 13% difference in overall accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3847","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3847","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3848","fieldValue":" This paper investigates data augmentation for deep neural network acoustic modeling based on label-preserving transformations to deal with data sparsity. Two data augmentation approaches, vocal tract length perturbation (VTLP) and stochastic feature mapping (SFM), are investigated for both deep neural networks (DNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The approaches are focused on increasing speaker and speech variations of the limited training data such that the acoustic models trained with the augmented data are more robust to such variations. In addition, a two-stage data augmentation scheme based on a stacked architecture is proposed to combine VTLP and SFM as complementary approaches. Experiments are conducted on Assamese and Haitian Creole, two development languages of the IARPA Babel program, and improved performance on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and keyword search (KWS) is reported."}
