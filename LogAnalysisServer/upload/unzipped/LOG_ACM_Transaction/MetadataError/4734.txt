It is one of the most important indicators of physical or mental changes in aging patients. In this article, we investigate the problem of detecting social interaction patterns of patients in a skilled nursing facility using audio\/visual records. Our studies consist of both a â\u20ACœWizard of Ozâ\u20AC? style study and an experimental study of various sensors and detection models for detecting and summarizing social interactions among aging patients and caregivers. We first simulate plausible sensors using human labeling on top of audio and visual data collected from a skilled nursing facility. The most useful sensors and robust detection models are determined using the simulated sensors. We then present the implementation of some real sensors based on video and audio analysis techniques and evaluate the performance of these implementations in detecting interactions. We conclude the article with discussions and future work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25274","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3441","fieldValue":" This article investigates the effect of various design parameters of auditory information display on user performance in two basic information retrieval tasks. We conducted a user test with 22 participants in which sets of sound samples were presented. In the first task, the test participants were asked to detect a given sample among a set of samples. In the second task, the test participants were asked to estimate the relative number of instances of a given sample in two sets of samples. We found that the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of the sound samples had a significant effect on user performance in both tasks. For the sample detection task, the average error rate was about 10&percnt; with an SOA of 100 ms. For the numerosity estimation task, an SOA of at least 200 ms was necessary to yield average error rates lower than 30&percnt;. Other parameters, including the samples' sound type (synthesized speech or earcons) and spatial quality (multichannel loudspeaker or diotic headphone playback), had no substantial effect on user performance. These results suggest that diotic, or indeed monophonic, playback with appropriately chosen SOA may be sufficient in practical applications for users to perform the given information retrieval tasks, if information about the sample location is not relevant. If location information was provided through spatial playback of the samples, test subjects were able to simultaneously detect and localize a sample with reasonable accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3441","fieldValue":"SOA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3441","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3441","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25275","fieldValue":" Video key frame extraction is one of the most important research problems for video summarization, indexing, and retrieval. For a variety of applications such as ubiquitous media access and video streaming, the temporal boundaries between video key frames are required for synchronizing visual content with audio. In this article, we define temporal video sampling as a unified process of extracting video key frames and computing their temporal boundaries, and formulate it as an optimization problem. We first provide an optimal approach that minimizes temporal video sampling error using a dynamic programming process. The optimal approach retrieves a key frame hierarchy and all temporal boundaries in $O(n^4) time and O(n2$) space. To further reduce computational complexity, we also provide a suboptimal greedy algorithm that exploits the data structure of a binary heap and uses a novel â\u20ACœlook-aheadâ\u20AC? computational technique, enabling all levels of key frames to be extracted with an average-case computational time of O(n log n) and memory usage of O(n). Both the optimal and the greedy methods are free of parameters, thus avoiding the threshold-selection problem that exists in other approaches. We empirically compare the proposed optimal and greedy methods with several existing methods in terms of video sampling error, computational cost, and subjective quality. An evaluation of eight videos of different genres shows that the greedy approach achieves performance very close to that of the optimal approach while drastically reducing computational cost, making it suitable for processing long video sequences in large video databases."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25275","fieldValue":"ACM"}
