The underlying process generating CNV segments is generally assumed to be memory-less, giving rise to an exponential distribution of segment lengths. In this paper, we provide evidence from cancer patient data, which suggests that this generative model is too simplistic, and that segment lengths follow a power-law distribution instead. We conjecture a simple preferential attachment generative model that provides the basis for the observed power-law distribution. We then show how an existing statistical method for detecting cancer driver genes can be improved by incorporating the power-law distribution in the null model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5130","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5130","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5130","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5131","fieldValue":" The organization of global protein interaction networks (PINs) has been extensively studied and heatedly debated. We revisited this issue in the context of the analysis of dynamic organization of a PIN in the yeast cell cycle. Statistically significant bimodality was observed when analyzing the distribution of the differences in expression peak between periodically expressed partners. A close look at their behavior revealed that date and party hubs derived from this analysis have some distinct features. There are no significant differences between them in terms of protein essentiality, expression correlation and semantic similarity derived from gene ontology (GO) biological process hierarchy. However, date hubs exhibit significantly greater values than party hubs in terms of semantic similarity derived from both GO molecular function and cellular component hierarchies. Relating to three-dimensional structures, we found that both single and multi-interface proteins could become date hubs coordinating multiple functions performed at different times while party hubs are mainly multiinterface proteins. Furthermore, we constructed and analyzed a PPI network specific to the human cell cycle and highlighted that the dynamic organization in human interactome is far more complex than the dichotomy of hubs observed in the yeast cell cycle."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5131","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5131","fieldValue":"Organized modularity in the interactome: evidence from the analysis of dynamic organization in the cell cycle"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5131","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5131","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4153","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
