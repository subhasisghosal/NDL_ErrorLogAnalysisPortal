A firewall checks each incoming or outgoing packet to decide whether to accept or discard the packet based on its policy. Optimizing firewall policies is crucial for improving network performance. Prior work on firewall optimization focuses on either intrafirewall or interfirewall optimization within one administrative domain where the privacy of firewall policies is not a concern. This paper explores interfirewall optimization across administrative domains for the first time. The key technical challenge is that firewall policies cannot be shared across domains because a firewall policy contains confidential information and even potential security holes, which can be exploited by attackers. In this paper, we propose the first cross-domain privacy-preserving cooperative firewall policy optimization protocol. Specifically, for any two adjacent firewalls belonging to two different administrative domains, our protocol can identify in each firewall the rules that can be removed because of the other firewall. The optimization process involves cooperative computation between the two firewalls without any party disclosing its policy to the other. We implemented our protocol and conducted extensive experiments. The results on real firewall policies show that our protocol can remove as many as 49% of the rules in a firewall, whereas the average is 19.4%. The communication cost is less than a few hundred kilobytes. Our protocol incurs no extra online packet processing overhead, and the offline processing time is less than a few hundred seconds."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10465","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10465","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10465","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10466","fieldValue":"Farhang-Boroujeny, Behrouz"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10466","fieldValue":" Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), widely recommended for sharing the spectrum among different nodes in a dynamic spectrum access network, imposes tight timing and frequency synchronization requirements. We examine the use of filterbank multicarrier (FBMC), a somewhat lesser known and understood alternative, for dynamic spectrum access. FBMC promises very low out-of-band energy of each subcarrier signal when compared to OFDM. In order to fully understand and evaluate the promise of FBMC, we first examine the use of special pulse-shaping filters of the FBMC PHY layer in reliably transmitting data packets at a very high rate. Next, to understand the impact of FBMC beyond the PHY layer, we devise a distributed and adaptive medium access control (MAC) protocol that coordinates data packet traffic among the different nodes in the network in a best-effort manner. Using extensive simulations, we show that FBMC consistently achieves at least an order of magnitude performance improvement over OFDM in several aspects including packet transmission delays, channel access delays, and effective data transmission rate available to each node in static, indoor settings. Using measurements of power spectral density and high data rate transmissions from a transceiver that we build using our National Instruments hardware platform, we show that while FBMC can decode\/distinguish all the received symbols without any errors, OFDM cannot. Finally, we also examine the use of FBMC in a vehicular network setup. We find that FBMC achieves an order of magnitude performance improvement over large distances in this setup as well. Furthermore, in the case of multihop vehicular networks, FBMC can achieve about 20Ã\u2014 smaller end-to-end data packet delivery delays and relatively low packet drop probabilities. In summary, FBMC offers a much higher performing alternative to OFDM for networks that dynamically share the spectrum among multiple nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10466","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10466","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10466","fieldValue":"ACM"}
