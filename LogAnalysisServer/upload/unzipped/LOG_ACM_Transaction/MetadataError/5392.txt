The solutions to the MULTIPLE GENE DUPLICATION problems can provide useful clues to place the gene duplication events onto the locations of a species tree and to expose the multiple gene duplication episodes. In this paper, we study two variations of the MULTIPLE GENE DUPLICATION problems: the EPISODE-CLUSTERING (EC) problem and the MINIMUM EPISODES (ME) problem. For the EC problem, we improve the results of Burleigh et al. with an optimal linear-time algorithm. For the ME problem, on the basis of the algorithm presented by Bansal and Eulenstein, we propose an optimal linear-time algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4560","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4560","fieldValue":"Computational phylogenetics, gene duplication, computations on discrete structures, linear-time algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4560","fieldValue":"ACM"}
