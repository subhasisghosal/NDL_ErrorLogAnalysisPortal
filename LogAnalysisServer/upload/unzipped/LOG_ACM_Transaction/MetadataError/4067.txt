In particular, we explore the potential of using predicates that make explicit the hidden relation that holds between the nouns that form the noun compound. For example, mosquito that carries malaria is a paraphrase of the compound malaria mosquito in which the verb explicitly states the semantic relation between the two nouns. We study the utility of using such paraphrasing verbs, with associated weights, to build a representation of the semantics of a noun compound, for example, malaria mosquito can be represented as follows: carry (23), spread (16), cause (12), transmit (9), and so on. We also explore the potential of using multiple paraphrasing verbs as features for predicting abstract semantic relations such as CAUSE, and we demonstrate that using explicit paraphrases can help improve statistical machine translation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23093","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23094","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23094","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23095","fieldValue":" Our aim is to build listening agents that attentively listen to their users and satisfy their desire to speak and have themselves heard. This article investigates how to automatically create a dialogue control component of such a listening agent. We collected a large number of listening-oriented dialogues with their user satisfaction ratings and used them to create a dialogue control component that satisfies users by means of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Using a hybrid dialog controller where high-level dialog acts are chosen with a statistical policy and low-level slot values are populated by a wizard, we evaluated our dialogue control method in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment. The experimental results show that our POMDP-based method achieves significantly higher user satisfaction than other stochastic models, confirming the validity of our approach. This article is the first to verify, by using human users, the usefulness of POMDP-based dialogue control for improving user satisfaction in nontask-oriented dialogue systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23095","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23095","fieldValue":"ACM"}
