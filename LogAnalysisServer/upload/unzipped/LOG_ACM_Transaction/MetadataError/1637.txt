The shape of the programmable aperture can be adjusted and used to capture light field at full sensor resolution through multiple exposures without any additional optics and without moving the camera. High acquisition efficiency is achieved by employing an optimal multiplexing scheme, and quality data is obtained by using the two post-processing algorithms designed for self calibration of photometric distortion and for multi-view depth estimation. View-dependent depth maps thus generated help boost the angular resolution of light field. Various post-exposure photographic effects are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system and the quality of the captured light field."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15927","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15928","fieldValue":" Glare arises due to multiple scattering of light inside the camera's body and lens optics and reduces image contrast. While previous approaches have analyzed glare in 2D image space, we show that glare is inherently a 4D ray-space phenomenon. By statistically analyzing the ray-space inside a camera, we can classify and remove glare artifacts. In ray-space, glare behaves as high frequency noise and can be reduced by outlier rejection. While such analysis can be performed by capturing the light field inside the camera, it results in the loss of spatial resolution. Unlike light field cameras, we do not need to reversibly encode the spatial structure of the ray-space, leading to simpler designs. We explore masks for uniform and non-uniform ray sampling and show a practical solution to analyze the 4D statistics without significantly compromising image resolution. Although diffuse scattering of the lens introduces 4D low-frequency glare, we can produce useful solutions in a variety of common scenarios. Our approach handles photography looking into the sun and photos taken without a hood, removes the effect of lens smudges and reduces loss of contrast due to camera body reflections. We show various applications in contrast enhancement and glare manipulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15928","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15928","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2510","fieldValue":" Broadcast Scheduling is a popular method for disseminating information in response to client requests. There are n pages of information, and clients request pages at different times. However, multiple clients can have their requests satisfied by a single broadcast of the requested page. In this article, we consider several related broadcast scheduling problems. One central problem we study simply asks to minimize the maximum response time (over all requests). Another related problem we consider is the version in which every request has a release time and a deadline, and the goal is to maximize the number of requests that meet their deadlines. While approximation algorithms for both these problems were proposed several years back, it was not known if they were NP-complete. One of our main results is that both these problems are NP-complete. In addition, we use the same unified approach to give a simple NP-completeness proof for minimizing the sum of response times. A very complicated proof was known for this version. Furthermore, we give a proof that FIFO is a 2-competitive online algorithm for minimizing the maximum response time (this result had been claimed earlier with no proof) and that there is no better deterministic online algorithm (this result was claimed earlier as well, but with an incorrect proof)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2510","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2510","fieldValue":"ACM"}
