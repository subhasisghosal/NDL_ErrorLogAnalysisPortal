In this article, we address a subset of crowdsourcing, named citizen-sourcing, where citizens interact with authorities collaboratively and actively. Many systems have experimented citizen-sourcing in city governance processes; however, their maturity levels are mixed. In order to focus on the service maturity, we introduce a city service maturity framework that contains five levels of service support and two levels of information integration. As an example, we introduce CITY FEED, which implements citizen-sourcing in city issue management process. In order to support such process, CITY FEED supports all levels of the maturity framework (publishing, transacting, interacting, collaborating, and evaluating) and integrates related information relationally and heterogeneously. In order to integrate heterogeneous information, it implements a threefold feed deduplication mechanism based on the geographic, text semantic, and image similarities of feeds. Currently, CITY FEED is in a pilot stage."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7722","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7722","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7723","fieldValue":"Huang, Shih-Wen"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7723","fieldValue":"Fu, Wai-Tat"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7723","fieldValue":" The process of generating schematic maps of salient objects from a set of pictures of an indoor environment is challenging. It has been an active area of research as it is crucial to a wide range of context- and location-aware services, as well as for general scene understanding. Although many automated systems have been developed to solve the problem, most of them either require predefining labels or expensive equipment, such as RGBD sensors or lasers, to scan the environment. In this article, we introduce a prototype system to show how human computations can be utilized to generate schematic maps from a set of pictures, without making strong assumptions or demanding extra devices. The system requires humans (crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turks) to do simple spatial mapping tasks in various conditions, and their data are aggregated by filtering and clustering techniques that allow salient cues to be identified in the pictures and their spatial relations to be inferred and projected on a two-dimensional map. In particular, we tested and demonstrated the effectiveness of two methods that improved the quality of the generated schematic map: (1) We encouraged humans to adopt an allocentric representations of salient objects by guiding them to perform mental rotations of these objects and (2) we sensitized human perception by guided arrows superimposed on the imagery to improve the accuracy of depth and width estimation. We demonstrated the feasibility of our system by evaluating the results of schematic maps generated from indoor pictures taken from an office building. By calculating Riemannian shape distances between the generated maps to the ground truth, we found that the generated schematic maps captured the spatial relations well. Our results showed that the combination of human computations and machine clustering could lead to more-accurate schematized maps from imagery. We also discuss how our approach may have important insights on methods that leverage human computations in other areas."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7723","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7723","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7724","fieldValue":" Despite the ever-increasing popularity of crowdsourcing (CS) in both industry and academia, procedures that ensure quality in its results are still elusive. We hypothesise that a CS design based on game theory can persuade workers to perform their tasks as quickly as possible with the highest quality. In order to do so, in this article we propose a CS framework inspired by the n-person Chicken game. Our aim is to address the problem of CS quality without compromising on CS benefits such as low monetary cost and high task completion speed. With that goal in mind, we study the effects of knowledge updates as well as incentives for good workers to continue playing. We define a general task with the characteristics of relevance assessment as a case study, because it has been widely explored in the past with CS due to its potential cost and complexity. In order to investigate our hypotheses, we conduct a simulation where we study the effect of the proposed framework on data accuracy, task completion time, and total monetary rewards. Based on a game-theoretical analysis, we study how different types of individuals would behave under a particular game scenario. In particular, we simulate a population comprised of different types of workers with varying ability to formulate optimal strategies and learn from their experiences. A simulation of the proposed framework produced results that support our hypothesis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7724","fieldValue":"ACM"}
