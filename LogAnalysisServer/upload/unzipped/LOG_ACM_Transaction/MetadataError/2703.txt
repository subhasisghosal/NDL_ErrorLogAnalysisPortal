P2MESH supports several discretization methods on triangles and quadrilaterals, such as finite volume or finite element. The design philosophy of P2MESH does not consider specific model problems or built-in approximation algorithms. The software package is general purpose and it may also be used as a building block in the implementation of numerical codes both for engineering applications and mathematical problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19020","fieldValue":"Algorithm 817: P2MESH: generic object-oriented interface between 2-D unstructured meshes and FEM\/FVM-based PDE solvers"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19020","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19020","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2840","fieldValue":" In this article we present an automatic approach to extracting Hindi-English (H-E) Named Entity (NE) translingual equivalences from bilingual parallel corpora. In the absence of a Hindi NE tagger or H-E translation dictionary, this approach adapts a Chinese-English (C-E) surface string transliteration model for H-E NE extraction. The model is initially trained using automatically extracted C-E NE pairs, then iteratively updated based on newly extracted H-E NE pairs. For each English person and location NE in each sentence pair, this approach searches for its Hindi correspondence with minimum transliteration cost and constructs an H-E NE list from the bilingual corpus. Experiments show that this approach extracted 1000 H-E NE pairs with a precision of 91.8&percnt;."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2840","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2840","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19021","fieldValue":"ACM"}
