It is based on the appropriate formulation of a general system model, being therefore independent of either the particular co-design problem or the specific partitioning procedure. The techniques under study are a knowledge-based system and three classical circuit partitioning algorithms (Simulated Annealing, Kernighan&Lin and Hierarchical Clustering). The former has been entirely proposed by the authors in previous works while the later have been properly extended to deal with system level issues. We will show how the way the problem is solved biases the results obtained, regarding both quality and convergence rate. Consequently it is extremely important to choose the most suitable technique for the particular co-design problem that is being confronted."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12867","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12867","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12868","fieldValue":" Three dimensional integration is an increasingly feasible method of implementing complex circuitry. For large circuits, which most benefit from 3-D designs, efficient placement algorithms with low time complexity are required.We present an iterative 3-D placement algorithm that places circuit elements in three dimensions in linear time. Using an order of magnitude less time, our proposed algorithm produces placements with better than 11&percnt; less wire lengths than partitioning placement using the best and fastest partitioner. Due to the algorithms iterative nature, wire-length results can be further improved by increasing the number of iterations.Further, we provide empirical evidence that large circuits benefit most from 3-D technology and that even a small number of layers can provide significant wire-length improvements."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12868","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12868","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12869","fieldValue":" This paper presents a novel method to reduce routing congestion during placement stage. The proposed approach is used as a post-processing step in placement. Congestion reduction is based on local improvement on the existing layout. However, the approach has a global view of the congestion over the entire design. It uses integer linear programming (ILP) to formulate the problem of conflicts between multiple congested regions, and performs local improvement according to the solution of the ILP problem. The approximation algorithm of the formulated ILP problem is studied and good approximation bounds are given and proved. Experiments show that the proposed approach can effectively alleviate the congestion of global routing results. The low computational complexity of the proposed approach indicates its scalability on large designs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12869","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12869","fieldValue":"ACM"}
