{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11604","fieldValue":" In a seminal paper from 1985, Sistla and Clarke showed that the model-checking problem for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is either NP-complete or PSPACE-complete, depending on the set of temporal operators used. If in contrast, the set of propositional operators is restricted, the complexity may decrease. This article systematically studies the model-checking problem for LTL formulae over restricted sets of propositional and temporal operators. For almost all combinations of temporal and propositional operators, we determine whether the model-checking problem is tractable (in PTIME) or intractable (NP-hard). We then focus on the tractable cases, showing that they all are NL-complete or even logspace solvable. This leads to a surprising gap in complexity between tractable and intractable cases. It is worth noting that our analysis covers an infinite set of problems, since there are infinitely many sets of propositional operators."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11604","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11604","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11605","fieldValue":"Subrahmanian, Venkatramana V S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11605","fieldValue":" The semantics of most logics of time and probability is given via a probability distribution over threads, where a thread is a structure specifying what will be true at different points in time (in the future). When assessing the probabilities of statements such as â\u20ACœEvent a will occur within 5 units of time of event b,â\u20AC? there are many different semantics possible, even when assessing the truth of this statement within a single thread. We introduce the syntax of annotated probabilistic temporal (APT) logic programs and axiomatically introduce the key notion of a frequency function (for the first time) to capture different types of intrathread reasoning, and then provide a semantics for intrathread and interthread reasoning in APT logic programs parameterized by such frequency functions. We develop a comprehensive set of complexity results for consistency checking and entailment in APT logic programs, together with sound and complete algorithms to check consistency and entailment. The basic algorithms use linear programming, but we then show how to substantially and correctly reduce the sizes of these linear programs to yield better computational properties. We describe a real world application we are developing using APT logic programs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11605","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11605","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11606","fieldValue":" LF is a dependent type theory in which many other formal systems can be conveniently embedded. However, correct use of LF relies on nontrivial metatheoretic developments such as proofs of correctness of decision procedures for LF's judgments. Although detailed informal proofs of these properties have been published, they have not been formally verified in a theorem prover. We have formalized these properties within Isabelle\/HOL using the Nominal Datatype Package, closely following a recent article by Harper and Pfenning. In the process, we identified and resolved a gap in one of the proofs and a small number of minor lacunae in others. We also formally derive a version of the type checking algorithm from which Isabelle\/HOL can generate executable code. Besides its intrinsic interest, our formalization provides a foundation for studying the adequacy of LF encodings, the correctness of Twelf-style metatheoretic reasoning, and the metatheory of extensions to LF."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11606","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11606","fieldValue":"ACM"}
