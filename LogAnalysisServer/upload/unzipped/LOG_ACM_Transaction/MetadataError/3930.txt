{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22699","fieldValue":" Formal specifications can precisely and unambiguously define the required behavior of a software system or component. However, formal specifications are complex artifacts that need to be verified to ensure that they are consistent, complete, and validated against the requirements. Specification testing or animation tools exist to assist with this by allowing the specifier to interpret or execute the specification. However, currently little is known about how to do this effectively.This article presents a framework and tool support for the systematic testing of formal, model-based specifications. Several important generic properties that should be satisfied by model-based specifications are first identified. Following the idea of mutation analysis, we then use variants or mutants of the specification to check that these properties are satisfied. The framework also allows the specifier to test application-specific properties. All properties are tested for a range of states that are defined by the tester in the form of a testgraph, which is a directed graph that partially models the states and transitions of the specification being tested. Tool support is provided for the generation of the mutants, for automatically traversing the testgraph and executing the test cases, and for reporting any errors. The framework is demonstrated on a small specification and its application to three larger specifications is discussed. Experience indicates that the framework can be used effectively to test small to medium-sized specifications and that it can reveal a significant number of problems in these specifications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22699","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22699","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/22700","fieldValue":"Ferrari, Gian-Luigi"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22700","fieldValue":" This article presents a semantic-based environment for reasoning about the behavior of mobile systems. The verification environment, called HAL, exploits a novel automata-like model that allows finite-state verification of systems specified in the Ï\u20AC-calculus. The HAL system is able to interface with several efficient toolkits (e.g. model-checkers) to determine whether or not certain properties hold for a given specification. We report experimental results on some case studies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22700","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22700","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3214","fieldValue":" A prototype augmented reality computer-aided-drawing (AR CAD) prototype aimed at supporting a design detailing and review process has been developed. Utilizing head-mounted displays, AR CAD supports users in manipulating design models with two possible view change mechanisms---observer movement around the virtual object (model) or rotation of the virtual object. Previous studies in scene recognition across views of real objects yielded performances that were better under observer movement conditions, than under object rotation conditions. Based on these studies, it is hypothesized that the perception of 3D designs in an augmented scene from the AR CAD prototype is also better when changing views by observer movement than by model rotation. This study presents an experiment to test this hypothesis, so as to address the question of the appropriate mechanisms for view change that best support the perception of 3D designs presented in an augmented reality platform. The findings from the experiment suggest that an individual's perception of 3D designs in an augmented scene from AR CAD depends, in part, on the type of view change, showing that performance was better after observer movement than after model rotation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3214","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3214","fieldValue":"ACM"}
