H-matrix has been shown to provide a data-sparse way to approximate the matrices and their inverses with almost linear-space and time complexities. In this work, we apply the H-matrix concept for solving heating diffusion problems modeled by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) based on the finite element method. We show that the matrix from a FE-based steady and transient thermal analysis can be represented by H-matrix without any approximation, and its inverse and Cholesky factors can be evaluated by H-matrix with controlled accuracy. We then show and prove that the memory and time complexities of the solver are bounded by $O(k_1 N log N) and $O(k1^2 N log2$ N), respectively, where k1$ is a small quantity determined by accuracy requirements and N is the number of unknowns in the system. The comparison with existing product-quality LU solvers, CSPARSE and UMFPACK, on a number of 3D IC thermal matrices, shows that the new method is much more memory efficient than these methods, which however prevents CPU time comparison with those methods on large examples. But the proposed method can solve all the given thermal circuits with decent scalabilities, which shows good agreement with the predicted theoretical results."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/13452","fieldValue":"<i>H<\/i>-matrix"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13453","fieldValue":"Al Farisi, Brahim"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13453","fieldValue":" Parameterised configurations are FPGA configuration bitstreams in which the bits are defined as functions of user-defined parameters. From a parameterised configuration, it is possible to quickly and efficiently derive specialised, regular configuration bitstreams by evaluating these functions. The specialised bitstreams have different properties and functionality depending on the chosen values of the parameters. The most important application of parameterised configurations is the generation of specialised configuration bitstreams for Dynamic Circuit Specialisation, a technique for optimising circuits at runtime using partial reconfiguration of the FPGA. Generating and using parameterised configurations requires a new FPGA tool flow. In this article, we present a new technology mapping algorithm for parameterised designs, called TCONMAP, that can be used to produce parameterised configurations in which both the configuration of the logic blocks and routing is a function of the parameters. In our experiments, we demonstrate that in using TCONMAP, the depth and area of the mapped circuit is close to the minimal depth and area attainable. Both Dynamic Circuit Specialisation and fine-grained modular reconfiguration are extracted by TCONMAP from the HDL description of the design requiring only simple parameter annotations."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13453","fieldValue":"FPGA"}
