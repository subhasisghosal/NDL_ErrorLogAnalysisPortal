To optimize data usage of programs in the presence of the memory hierarchy, we are particularly interested in two compiler techniques: pool allocation and field layout restructuring. Since foreseeing runtime behaviors of programs at compile time is difficult, most of the previous work relied on profiling. On the contrary, our goal is to develop a fully automatic compiler that statically transforms input codes to use memory efficiently. Noticing that regular expressions, which denote repetition explicitly, are sufficient for memory access patterns, we describe how to extract memory access patterns as regular expressions in detail. Based on static patterns presented in regular expressions, we apply pool allocation to repeatedly accessed structures and exploit field layout restructuring according to field affinity relations of chosen structures. To make a scalable framework, we devise and apply new abstraction techniques, which build and interpret access patterns for the whole programs in a bottom-up fashion. We implement our analyses and transformations with the CIL compiler. To verify the effect and scalability of our scheme, we examine 17 benchmarks including 2 SPECINT 2000 benchmarks whose source lines of code are larger than 10,000. Our experiments demonstrate that the static layout transformations for dynamic memory can reduce L1D cache misses by 16&percnt; and execution times by 14&percnt; on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1687","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7562","fieldValue":"Carley, Kathleen M"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7562","fieldValue":"Hong, Jason I"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7562","fieldValue":" Peter Blau was one of the first to define a latent social space and utilize it to provide concrete hypotheses. Blau defines social structure via social â\u20ACœparametersâ\u20AC? (constraints). Actors that are closer together (more homogenous) in this social parameter space are more likely to interact. One of Blauâ\u20AC™s most important hypotheses resulting from this work was that the consolidation of parameters could lead to isolated social groups. For example, the consolidation of race and income might lead to segregation. In the present work, we use Foursquare data from New York City to explore evidence of homogeneity along certain social parameters and consolidation that breeds social isolation in communities of locations checked in to by similar users. More specifically, we first test the extent to which communities detected via Latent Dirichlet Allocation are homogenous across a set of four social constraintsâ\u20AC\u201Dracial homophily, income homophily, personal interest homophily and physical space. Using a bootstrapping approach, we find that 14 (of 20) communities are statistically, and all but one qualitatively, homogenous along one of these social constraints, showing the relevance of Blauâ\u20AC™s latent space model in venue communities determined via user check-in behavior. We then consider the extent to which communities with consolidated parameters, those homogenous on more than one parameter, represent socially isolated populations. We find communities homogenous on multiple parameters, including a homosexual community and a â\u20ACœhipsterâ\u20AC? community, that show support for Blauâ\u20AC™s hypothesis that consolidation breeds social isolation. We consider these results in the context of mediated communication, in particular in the context of self-representation on social media."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7562","fieldValue":"Check-ins in â\u20ACœBlau Spaceâ\u20AC?: Applying Blauâ\u20AC™s Macrosociological Theory to Foursquare Check-ins from New York City"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7562","fieldValue":"ACM"}
