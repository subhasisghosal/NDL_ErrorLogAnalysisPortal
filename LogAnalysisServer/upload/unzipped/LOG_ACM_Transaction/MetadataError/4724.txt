In this research, we propose a layered ULP (L-ULP) scheme to solve these problems. In particular, we use the rate-based optimal solution with a local search to find the average forward error correction (FEC) allocation and use the gradient search to find the FEC solution for each layer. Experimental results show that the executing time of L-ULP is much faster than the traditional ULP scheme but the average distortion is worse. Therefore, we further propose to combine the L-ULP with the pre-interleaving to have an improved L-ULP (IL-ULP) system. By using the pre-interleaving, we are able to delay the occurrence of the first unrecoverable loss in the source bitstream and thus improve the loss resilience performance. With the better loss resilience performance in the source bitstream, our proposed IL-ULP scheme is allowed to have a weaker FEC protection and allocate more bits to the source coding which leads to the improvement of overall performance. Experimental results show that our proposed IL-ULP scheme even outperforms the global optimal result obtained by any traditional ULP scheme while the complexity of IL-ULP is almost the same as L-ULP."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25249","fieldValue":"Layered unequal loss protection with pre-interleaving for fast progressive image transmission over packet-loss channels"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25249","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3438","fieldValue":"Kronland-Martinet, Richard"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3438","fieldValue":" This article addresses the question of synthesis and control of sound attributes from a perceptual point of view. We focused on an attribute related to the general concept of motion evoked by sounds. To investigate this concept, we tested 40 monophonic abstract sounds on listeners via a questionnaire and drawings, using a parametrized custom interface. This original procedure, which was defined with synthesis and control perspectives in mind, provides an alternative means of determining intuitive control parameters for synthesizing sounds evoking motion. Results showed that three main shape categories (linear, with regular oscillations, and with circular oscillations) and three types of direction (rising, descending, and horizontal) were distinguished by the listeners. In addition, the subjects were able to perceive the low-frequency oscillations (below 8 Hz) quite accurately. Three size categories (small, medium, and large) and three levels of randomness (none, low amplitude irregularities, and high amplitude irregularities) and speed (constant speed and speeds showing medium and large variations) were also observed in our analyses of the participants' drawings. We further performed a perceptual test to confirm the relevance of the contribution of some variables with synthesized sounds combined with visual trajectories. Based on these results, a general typology of evoked motion was drawn up and an intuitive control strategy was designed, based on a symbolic representation of continuous trajectories (provided by devices such as motion capture systems, pen tablets, etc.). These generic tools could be used in a wide range of applications such as sound design, virtual reality, sonification, and music."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3438","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3438","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25250","fieldValue":"Tu, Yi-Cheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25250","fieldValue":" Recent research efforts have demonstrated the great potential of building cost-effective media streaming systems on top of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. A P2P media streaming architecture can reach a large streaming capacity that is difficult to achieve in conventional server-based streaming services. Hybrid streaming systems that combine the use of dedicated streaming servers and P2P networks were proposed to build on the advantages of both paradigms. However, the dynamics of such systems and the impact of various factors on system behavior are not totally clear. In this article, we present an analytical framework to quantitatively study the features of a hybrid media streaming model. Based on this framework, we derive an equation to describe the capacity growth of a single-file streaming system. We then extend the analysis to multi-file scenarios. We also show how the system achieves optimal allocation of server bandwidth among different media objects. The unpredictable departure\/failure of peers is a critical factor that affects the performance of P2P systems. We utilize the concept of peer lifespan to model peer failures. The original capacity growth equation is enhanced with coefficients generated from peer lifespans that follow an exponential distribution. We also propose a failure model under arbitrarily distributed peer lifespan. Results from large-scale simulations support our analysis."}
