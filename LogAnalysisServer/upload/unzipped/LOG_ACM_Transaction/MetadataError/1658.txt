However, uniform scaling is limited in its applicability while straightforward non-uniform scaling can destroy features and lead to serious visual artifacts. Our goal is to define a method that protects model features and structures during resizing. We observe that typically, during scaling some parts of the models are more vulnerable than others, undergoing undesirable deformation. We automatically detect vulnerable regions and carry this information to a protective grid defined around the object, defining a vulnerability map. The 3D model is then resized by a space-deformation technique which scales the grid non-homogeneously while respecting this map. Using space-deformation allows processing of common models of man-made objects that consist of multiple components and contain non-manifold structures. We show that our technique resizes models while suppressing undesirable distortion, creating models that preserve the structure and features of the original ones."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15979","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15979","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15980","fieldValue":" This paper presents a technique to enhance a kinematically controlled virtual character with a generic class of dynamic responses to small perturbations. Given an input motion sequence, our technique can synthesize reactive motion to arbitrary external forces with a specific style customized to the input motion. Our method re-parameterizes the motion degrees of freedom based on joint actuations in the input motion. By only enforcing the equations of motion in the less actuated coordinates, our approach can create physically responsive motion based on kinematic pose control without explicitly computing the joint actuations. We demonstrate the simplicity and robustness of our technique by showing a variety of examples generated with the same set of parameters. Our formulation focuses on the type of perturbations that significantly disrupt the upper body poses and dynamics, but have limited effect on the whole-body balance state."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15980","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15981","fieldValue":"van de Pann, Michiel"}
