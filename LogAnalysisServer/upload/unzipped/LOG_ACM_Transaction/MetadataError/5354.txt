[CHECK END OF SENTENCE], and the problem Maximum Stacking Base Pairs proposed by Lyngs√∏ [CHECK END OF SENTENCE]. For the 2-Interval Pattern, we present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the problem over the preceding-and-crossing model and on input with the unitary restriction. For Maximum Base Pair Stackings and Maximum Stacking Base Pairs, we present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the two problems on explicit input of candidate base pairs. We also propose a new problem called Length-Weighted Balanced 2-Interval Pattern, which is natural in the context of RNA secondary structure prediction."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4493","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4493","fieldValue":"ACM"}
