{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9746","fieldValue":" We address the problem of highly transient populations in unstructured and loosely structured peer-topeer (P2P) systems. We propose a number of illustrative queryrelated strategies and organizational protocols that, by taking into consideration the expected session times of peers (their lifespans), yield systems with performance characteristics more resilient to the natural instability of their environments. We first demonstrate the benefits of lifespan-based organizational protocols in terms of end-application performance and in the context of dynamic and heterogeneous Internet environments. We do this using a number of currently adopted and proposed query-related strategies, including methods for query distribution, caching, and replication. We then show, through trace-driven simulation and wide-area experimentation, the performance advantages of lifespan-based, query-related strategies when layered over currently employed and lifespan-based organizational protocols. While merely illustrative, the evaluated strategies and protocols clearly demonstrate the advantages of considering peers' session time in designing widely-deployed P2P systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9746","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9746","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9746","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9747","fieldValue":" We propose a model-based analytic approach for evaluating the overall efficacy of FEC coding combined with interleaving in combating packet losses in IP networks. In particular, by modeling the network path in terms of a single bottleneck node, described as a G\/M\/1\/K queue, we develop a recursive procedure for the exact evaluation of the packet-loss statistics for general arrival processes, based on the framework originally introduced by Cidon et al., 1993. To include the effects of interleaving, we incorporate a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) into our analytic framework. We study both single-session and multiple-session scenarios, and provide a simple algorithm for the more complicated multiple-session scenario. We show that the unified approach provides an integrated framework for exploring the tradeoffs between the key coding parameters; specifically, interleaving depths, channel coding rates and block lengths. The approach facilitates the selection of optimal coding strategies for different multimedia applications with various user quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and system constraints. We also provide an information-theoretic bound on the performance achievable with FEC coding in IP networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9747","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9747","fieldValue":"A model-based approach to evaluation of the efficacy of FEC coding in combating network packet losses"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1124","fieldValue":"Shyu, Mei-Ling"}
