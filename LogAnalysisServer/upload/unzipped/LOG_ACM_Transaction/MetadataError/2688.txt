The approximation is formed as a weighted sum of outer products of vectors whose elements are Â±1 or 0, so the storage required by the approximation is quite small. We also present a related algorithm for approximation of a tensor. Applications of the algorithms are presented to data compression, filtering, and information retrieval; software is provided in C and in Matlab."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18983","fieldValue":"ACM"}
