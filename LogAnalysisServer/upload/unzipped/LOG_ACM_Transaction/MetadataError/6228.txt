{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1606","fieldValue":" As quantum computing moves closer to reality the need for basic architectural studies becomes more pressing. Quantum wires, which transport quantum data, will be a fundamental component in all anticipated silicon quantum architectures. Since they cannot consist of a stream of electrons, as in the classical case, quantum wires must fundamentally be designed differently. In this paper, we present two quantum wire designs: a swap wire, based on swapping of adjacent qubits, and a teleportation wire, based on the quantum teleportation primitive. We characterize the latency and bandwidth of these two alternatives in a device-independent way. Furthermore, unlike classical wires, quantum wires need control signals in order to operate. We explore the complexity of the control mechanisms and the fundamental tension between the scale of quantum effects and the scale of the classical logic needed to control them. This \"pitch-matching\" problem imposes constraints on minimum wire lengths and wire intersections, leading us to use a SIMD approach for the control mechanisms. We ultimately show that qubit decoherence imposes a basic limit on the maximum communication distance of the swapping wire, while relatively large overhead imposes a basic limit on the minimum communication distance of the teleportation wire."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1606","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1606","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6604","fieldValue":" Deadlock prevention is crucial to the modeling of flexible manufacturing systems. In the Petri net framework, deadlock prevention is often addressed by siphon-based control (SC) policies. Recent research results show that SC methods can avoid full siphon enumeration by using mixed integer programming (MIP) to greatly increase the computational efficiency so that it can be applied in large systems in computable time. Besides, maximally permissive control solutions can be obtained by means of iterative siphon control (ISC) approaches and MIP. Then the remaining problems are redundancy and MIP iterations. Redundant controllers make the closed-loop system more complicated and each MIP iteration increases the total computational time. This article proposes a revised ISC deadlock prevention policy which can achieve better results than the other reported methods in terms of redundancy and MIP iterations while maintaining the maximal permissiveness. Several benchmark examples are provided to illustrate the proposed approach and to be compared with the other reported methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6604","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6604","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6605","fieldValue":" The bottleneck traveling salesman problem is to find a Hamiltonian circuit that minimizes the largest cost of any of its arcs in a graph. A simple genetic algorithm (GA) using sequential constructive crossover has been developed to obtain heuristic solution to the problem. The hybrid GA incorporates 2-opt search, another proposed local search and immigration to the simple GA for obtaining better solution. The efficiency of our hybrid GA to the problem against two existing heuristic algorithms has been examined for some symmetric TSPLIB instances. The comparative study shows the effectiveness of our hybrid algorithm. Finally, we present solutions to the problem for asymmetric TSPLIB instances."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6605","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6605","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6606","fieldValue":" It is desired that a deadlock control policy for automated manufacturing systems (AMS) is maximally permissive. However, its tractability issue remains open, and this work addresses this important issue. It models AMS with a resource-oriented Petri net (ROPN) and presents a necessary and sufficient condition under which there exists a one-step look-ahead maximally permissive control policy for deadlock avoidance in AMS. It further identifies some conditions under which a one-step look-ahead maximally permissive deadlock control policy exists for a single-capacity system. The conditions can be conveniently examined by using the developed ROPN model."}
