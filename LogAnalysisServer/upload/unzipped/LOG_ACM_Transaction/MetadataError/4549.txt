Extensions to the coupon collector's and gap tests are presented that examine the distribution and independence of radix-b digit patterns in sequences with modulo of the form bw. An algorithm is given and the test is applied to a number of popular generators. Theoretical expected values are derived for a number of defects that may be present in a pseudorandom sequence and additional empirical evidence is given to support these values. The test has a simple model and a known distribution function. It is easily and efficiently implemented and easily adaptable to testing only the bits of interest, griven a certain application."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24760","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24760","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3393","fieldValue":" Color constancy is an important perceptual ability of humans to recover the color of objects invariant of light information. It is also necessary for a robust machine vision system. Until now, a number of color constancy algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In particular, the edge-based color constancy uses the edge of an image to estimate light color. It is shown to be a rich framework that can represent many existing illumination estimation solutions with various parameter settings. However, color constancy is an ill-posed problem; every algorithm is always given out under some assumptions and can only produce the best performance when these assumptions are satisfied. In this article, we have investigated a combination strategy relying on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) technique that integrates the output of edge-based color constancy with multiple parameters. Experiments on real image data sets show that the proposed method works better than most single-color constancy methods and even some current state-of-the-art color constancy combination strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3393","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3393","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24761","fieldValue":" One popular family of low dicrepancy sets is the (t, m, s)-nets. Recently a randomization of these nets that preserves their net property has been introduced. In this article a formula for the mean square L2-discrepancy of (0, m, s)-nets in base b is derived. This formula has a computational complexity of only O(s log(N) + s2) for large N or s, where N = bm is the number of points. Moreover, the root mean square L2-discrepancy of (0, m, s)-nets is show to be O(N-1[log(N)](s-1)\/2) as N tends to infinity, the same asymptotic order as the known lower bound for the L2-discrepancy of an arbitrary set."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24761","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24761","fieldValue":"ACM"}
