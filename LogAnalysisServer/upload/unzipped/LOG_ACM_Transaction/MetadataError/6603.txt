There have been many exciting advances in this field, especially in recent years, while at the same time, there are also many open problems waiting for us to resolve. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of sponsored search auctions in hopes of helping both industry practitioners and academic researchers to become familiar with this field, to know the state of the art, and to identify future research topics. Specifically, we organize the article into two parts. In the first part, we review research works on sponsored search auctions with basic settings, where fully rational advertisers without budget constraints, preknown click-through rates (CTRs) without interdependence, and exact match between queries and keywords are assumed. Under these assumptions, we first introduce the generalized second price (GSP) auction, which is the most popularly used auction mechanism in the industry. Then we give the definitions of several well-studied equilibria and review the latest results on GSPâ\u20AC™s efficiency and revenue in these equilibria. In the second part, we introduce some advanced topics on sponsored search auctions. In these advanced topics, one or more assumptions made in the basic settings are relaxed. For example, the CTR of an ad could be unknown and dependent on other ads; keywords could be broadly matched to queries before auctions are executed; and advertisers are not necessarily fully rational, could have budget constraints, and may prefer rich bidding languages. Given that the research on these advanced topics is still immature, in each section of the second part, we provide our opinions on how to make further advances, in addition to describing what has been done by researchers in the corresponding direction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7590","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7590","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7591","fieldValue":" Clickthrough and conversation rates estimation are two core predictions tasks in display advertising. We present in this article a machine learning framework based on logistic regression that is specifically designed to tackle the specifics of display advertising.

Unlike traditional web ads, the advertiserâ\u20AC™s profits for group-buying ads depend on the time to expiry and additional customers needed to satisfy the minimum group size. Since both these quantities are time-dependent, optimal bid amounts to maximize profits change with every impression. Consequently, traditional static bidding strategies are far from optimal. Instead, bid values need to be optimized in real-time to maximize expected bidder profits. This online optimization of deal profits is made possible by the advent of ad exchanges offering real-time (spot) bidding. To this end, we propose a real-time bidding strategy for group-buying deals based on the online optimization of bid values. We derive the expected bidder profit of deals as a function of the bid amounts and dynamically vary the bids to maximize profits. Furthermore, to satisfy time constraints of the online bidding, we present methods of minimizing computation timings. Subsequently, we derive the real-time ad selection, admissibility, and real-time bidding of the traditional ads as the special cases of the proposed method. We evaluate the proposed bidding, selection, and admission strategies on a multimillion click stream of 935 ads. The proposed real-time bidding, selection, and admissibility show significant profit increases over the existing strategies. Further experiments illustrate the robustness of the bidding and acceptable computation timings."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7592","fieldValue":"ACM"}
