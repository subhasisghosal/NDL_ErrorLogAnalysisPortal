Unfortunately, piece and bandwidth availability may cause the file-sharing efficiency to degrade in small swarms with few participating peers. Using extensive measurements, we identified hundreds of thousands of torrents with several small swarms for which reallocating peers among swarms and\/or modifying the peer behavior could significantly improve the system performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a centralized and a distributed protocol for dynamic swarm management. The centralized protocol (CSM) manages the swarms of peers at minimal tracker overhead. The distributed protocol (DSM) manages the swarms of peers while ensuring load fairness among the trackers. Both protocols achieve their performance improvements by identifying and merging small swarms and allow load sharing for large torrents. Our evaluations are based on measurement data collected during eight days from over 700 trackers worldwide, which collectively maintain state information about 2.8 million unique torrents. We find that CSM and DSM can achieve most of the performance gains of dynamic swarm management. These gains are estimated to be up to 40% on average for small torrents."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10425","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10425","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10425","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10426","fieldValue":"Li, Xiang-Yang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10426","fieldValue":" Localization is a fundamental issue of wireless sensor networks that has been extensively studied in the literature. Our real-world experience from GreenOrbs, a sensor network system deployed in a forest, shows that localization in the wild remains very challenging due to various interfering factors. In this paper, we propose CDL, a Combined and Differentiated Localization approach for localization that exploits the strength of range-free approaches and range-based approaches using received signal strength indicator (RSSI). A critical observation is that ranging quality greatly impacts the overall localization accuracy. To achieve a better ranging quality, our method CDL incorporates virtual-hop localization, local filtration, and ranging-quality aware calibration. We have implemented and evaluated CDL by extensive real-world experiments in GreenOrbs and large-scale simulations. Our experimental and simulation results demonstrate that CDL outperforms current state-of-art localization approaches with a more accurate and consistent performance. For example, the average location error using CDL in GreenOrbs system is 2.9 m, while the previous best method SISR has an average error of 4.6 m."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10426","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
