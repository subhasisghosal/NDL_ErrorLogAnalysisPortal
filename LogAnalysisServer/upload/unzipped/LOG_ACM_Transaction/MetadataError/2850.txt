We analyze this phenomenon and show that in the âˆž-norm it happens precisely when x has components of widely varying magnitude and every component of x of largest magnitude agrees with the corresponding component of y. Performance profiles are a popular way to compare competing algorithms according to particular measures of performance. We show that performance profiles based on normwise relative errors can give a misleading impression due to the influence of zero or tiny normwise relative errors. We propose a transformation that reduces the influence of these extreme errors in a controlled manner, while preserving the monotonicity of the underlying data and leaving the performance profile unchanged at its left end-point. Numerical examples with both artificial and genuine data illustrate the benefits of the transformation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19357","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19357","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19358","fieldValue":"de Dinechin, Florent"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19358","fieldValue":"Muller, Jean-Michel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19358","fieldValue":" A very simple test, introduced by Ziv, allows one to determine if an approximation to the value f(x) of an elementary function at a given point x suffices to return the floating-point number nearest f(x). The same test may be used when implementing floating-point operations with input and output operands of different formats, using arithmetic operators tailored for manipulating operands of the same format. That test depends on a â\u20ACœmagic constantâ\u20AC? e. We show how to choose that constant e to make the test reliable and efficient. Various cases are considered, depending on the availability of an fma instruction, and on the range of f(x)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19358","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19359","fieldValue":"Kelly, Paul H J"}
