Our implementation, which is called SelInv, is built on top of an efficient supernodal left-looking LDLT factorization of A. We discuss how computational efficiency can be gained by making use of a relative index array to handle indirect addressing. We report the performance of SelInv on a collection of sparse matrices of various sizes and nonzero structures. We also demonstrate how SelInv can be used in electronic structure calculations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19296","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19296","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19297","fieldValue":" A Costas array is an arrangement of N dots on an N-by-N grid, one per row, one per column, such that no two dots share the same displacement vector with any other pair. Costas arrays have applications in SONAR\/RADAR systems, communication systems, cryptography, and other areas. We present a standardization of notation and language which can be used to discuss Costas array generation techniques and array manipulations. Using this standardization we can concisely and clearly state various theorems about Costas arrays, including several new theorems about the symmetries of Costas arrays. We also define labels for each array (generated, emergent, and sporadic), which describe whether the array is generated using a known technique, generated using a semiempirical variation of a known technique, or of unexplained origin. A new method for obtaining emergent Costas arrays, the DRT expansion, is also given here for the first time. A MATLAB Costas array toolbox has also been developed which implements the proposed standardization. The toolbox contains a comprehensive set of functions covering Costas array generation, manipulation and classification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19297","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19297","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19298","fieldValue":"Silvester, David J"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19298","fieldValue":" We discuss the design and implementation of a suite of functions for solving symmetric indefinite linear systems associated with mixed approximation of systems of PDEs. The novel feature of our iterative solver is the incorporation of error control in the natural â\u20ACœenergyâ\u20AC? norm in combination with an a posteriori estimator for the PDE approximation error. This leads to a robust and optimally efficient stopping criterion: the iteration is terminated as soon as the algebraic error is insignificant compared to the approximation error. We describe a â\u20ACœproof of conceptâ\u20AC? MATLAB implementation of this algorithm, which we call EST_MINRES, and we illustrate its effectiveness when integrated into the Incompressible Flow Iterative Solution Software (IFISS) package (cf. ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software 33, Article 14, 2007)."}
