In this paper, a UMP framework is developed for estimating service patterns and tracking mobile users, including descriptions of location, mobility, and service requirements. For each mobile user, the service requirement is estimated using a mean-square error method. Moreover, a new mobility model is designed to characterize not only stochastic behaviors, but historical records and predictive future locations of mobile users as well. Therefore, our approach incorporates aggregate history and current system parameters to acquire UMP. In particular, an adaptive algorithm is designed to predict the future positions of mobile terminals in terms of location probabilities based on moving directions and residence time in a cell. Simulation results are shown to indicate that the proposed schemes are effective on mobility and resource management by evaluating blocking\/dropping probabilities and location tracking costs in wireless networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9267","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9267","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9268","fieldValue":"Chen, Hsiao-Hwa"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9268","fieldValue":"Tea, Wee-Teck"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9268","fieldValue":" This paper focuses on performance analysis of a CDMA wireless data network based on hierarchy schedule-sensing (HSS) protocol, in which a common-code permission frame beacon is used to schedule request transmissions to avoid packet collisions. To further reduce scheduling delay, hierarchical group-based coding is adopted in the scheme. The performance of such a network is evaluated considering packet collisions with and without packet capture effect using a two-dimensional Markovian chain model. In particular, this paper will study the impact of multiple packet-collision effect on network performance with the help of the average packet-collision rate derived explicitly in the paper. The obtained results show that, despite its low implementation complexity, the HSS protocol is a fairly robust medium-access control protocol featuring uniformly high throughput and short delay even under very high traffic load, which especially suits data-centric wireless networks with relatively small coverage area and great node density."}
