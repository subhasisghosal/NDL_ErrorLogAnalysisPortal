By allowing peers serving each other in the network, P2P technology overcomes many limitations in the traditional client-server paradigm to achieve user and bandwidth scalabilities. However, existing systems do not perform well when the number of online students increases, and the system performance degrades seriously. One of the reasons is that the construction of the peer overlay in existing P2P systems has not considered the underlying physical network topology and can cause serious topology mismatch between the P2P overlay network and the physical network. The topology mismatch problem brings great link stress (unnecessary traffic) in the Internet infrastructure and greatly degrades the system performance. In this article, we address this problem and propose a locality-aware P2P overlay construction method, called Nearcast, which builds an efficient overlay multicast tree by letting each peer node choose physically closer nodes as its logical children. We have conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of Nearcast in comparison with the existing RTT and NICE protocols. Also, Nearcast has been deployed on a wide-area network testbed to delivery video coursed to about 7200 users distributed across 100 collages in 32 cities in China. The experimental results show that Nearcast leads to lower link stress and shorter end-to-end latencies compared with the RTT and NICE protocols."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24375","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24376","fieldValue":" In this article, we describe a Smart Space for Learning#8482; (SS4L) framework and infrastructure that enables personalized access to distributed heterogeneous knowledge repositories. Helping a learner to choose an appropriate learning resource or activity is a key problem which we address in this framework, enabling personalized access to federated learning repositories with a vast number of learning offers. Our infrastructure includes personalization strategies both at the query and the query results level. Query rewriting is based on learning and language preferences; rule-based and ranking-based personalization improves these results further. Rule-based reasoning techniques are supported by formal ontologies we have developed based on standard information models for learning domains; ranking-based recommendations are supported through ensuring minimal sets of predicates appearing in query results. Our evaluation studies show that the implemented solution enables learners to find relevant learning resources in a distributed environment and through goal-based personalization improves relevancy of results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24376","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24377","fieldValue":" The large diffusion of e-learning technologies represents a great opportunity for underserved segments of population. This is particularly true for people with disabilities for whom digital barriers should be overstepped with the aim of reengaging them back into society to education. In essence, before a mass of learners can be engaged in a collective educational process, each single member should be put in the position to enjoy accessible and customized educational experiences, regardless of the wide diversity of their personal characteristics and technological equipment. To respond to this demand, we developed LOT (Learning Object Transcoder), a distributed PHP-based service-oriented system designed to deliver flexible and customized educational services for a multitude of learners, each with his\/her own diverse preferences and needs. The main novelty of LOT amounts to a broking service able to manage the transcoding activities needed to convert multimedia digital material into the form which better fits a given student profile. Transcoding activities are performed based on the use of Web service technologies. Experimental results gathered from several field trials with LOT (available online at http:\/\/137.204.74.83\/âˆ¼lot\/) have confirmed the viability of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24377","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24377","fieldValue":"ACM"}
