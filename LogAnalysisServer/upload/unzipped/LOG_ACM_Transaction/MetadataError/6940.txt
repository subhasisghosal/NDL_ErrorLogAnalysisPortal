In this paper, we focus on multi-core processors, with the global Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Dynamic Power Management (DPM) technologies. In this setting, we propose an energy-efficient real-time scheduling algorithm, the Time Local remaining execution plane based Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (TL-DVFS). TL-DVFS utilizes the concept of Time Local remaining execution (TL) plane to dynamically scale the voltage and frequency of a processor at the initial time of each TL plane as well as at the release time of a sporadic task in each TL plane. Consequently, TL-DVFS can obtain a reasonable tradeoff between the real-time constraint and the energy-saving while realizing the optimal feasibility of sporadic tasks. Mathematical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that TL-DVFS always saves more energy than existing algorithms, especially in the case of high workloads, and guarantees the optimal feasibility of sporadic tasks at the same time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1772","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8643","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8643","fieldValue":"Delay performance of some scheduling strategies in an input queuing ATM switch with multiclass bursty traffic"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8643","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8643","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8644","fieldValue":"Clementi, Andrea E F"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8644","fieldValue":"Di Ianni, Miriam"}
