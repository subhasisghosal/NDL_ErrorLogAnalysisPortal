Originally developed by (and for!) the first author, the tool replaces the standard input devicesâ\u20AC\u201Dthat is, keyboard and mouseâ\u20AC\u201Dwith a small numeric keypad, making optimal use of his abilities. This work attempts to illustrate some of the difficulties the first author usually has to face when operating a computer, due to considerable motor problems. The article will discuss what he tried in the past, and why OnScreenDualScribe, offering various assistive techniquesâ\u20AC\u201Dincluding word prediction, an ambiguous keyboard, and stepwise pointing operationsâ\u20AC\u201Dis indeed a viable alternative. In a pilot study that was repeated multiple times with slight variations over a period of 3 years, the first author's entry rate with OnScreenDualScribe (including early versions of the tool) increased from 1.38wpm to 6.16wpm, while his achievable typing rate went from 12wpm to 3.5wpm in the course of 24 years. However, the ultimate goal is to help not just one single person, but to make the systemâ\u20AC\u201Dwhich not only accelerates entry, but also clearly reduces the required effortâ\u20AC\u201Davailable to anyone with similar conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1481","fieldValue":"Experiences of Someone with a Neuromuscular Disease in Operating a PC (and Ways to Successfully Overcome Challenges)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1481","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1481","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5736","fieldValue":" Over six years, we iterated on the design of a language for describing the functionality of appliances, such as televisions, telephones, VCRs, and copiers. This language has been used to describe more than thirty diverse appliances, and these descriptions have been used to automatically generate both graphical and speech user interfaces on handheld computers, mobile phones, and desktop computers. In this article, we describe the final design of our language and analyze the key design choices that led to this design. Through this analysis, we hope to provide a useful guide for the designers of future user interface description languages."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5736","fieldValue":"Creating a lightweight user interface description language: An overview and analysis of the personal universal controller project"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5737","fieldValue":"Ladry, Jean-Francois"}
