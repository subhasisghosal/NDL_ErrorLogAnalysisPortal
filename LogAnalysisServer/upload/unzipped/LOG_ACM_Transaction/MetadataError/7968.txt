We not only allow nonexponential user lifetimes and age-dependent neighbor selection, but also cover both active and passive neighbormanagement strategies, model the lifetimes of incoming and outgoing links, derive churn-related message volume of the system, and obtain the distribution of transient in\/out degree at each user. We then discuss the impact of design parameters on overhead and resilience of the network."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10753","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10753","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10754","fieldValue":" With increasing popularity of media-enabled hand-helds and their integration with the in-vehicle entertainment systems, the need for high-data-rate services for mobile users on the go is evident. This ever-increasing demand of data is constantly surpassing what cellular networks can economically support. Large-scale wireless local area networks (WLANs) can provide such a service, but they are expensive to deploy and maintain. Open WLAN access points, on the other hand, need no new deployments, but can offer only opportunistic services, lacking any performance guarantees. In contrast, a carefully planned sparse deployment of roadside WiFi provides an economically scalable infrastructure with quality-of-service assurance to mobile users. In this paper, we present a new metric, called Contact Opportunity, to closely model the quality of data service that a mobile user might experience when driving through the system. We then present efficient deployment algorithms for minimizing the cost for ensuring a required level of contact opportunity. We further extend this concept and the deployment techniques to a more intuitive metric---the average throughput---by taking various dynamic elements into account. Simulations over a real road network and experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly better cost versus throughput tradeoff in both the worst case and average case compared to some commonly used deployment algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10754","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10754","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10755","fieldValue":"Lee, Hyang-Won"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10755","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of providing inter-access-point (AP) fairness guarantee in dense AP deployments where starvation can occur. In particular, we develop a framework for providing robust minimum throughput guarantee for each AP under the uncertainty of user distributions. Our framework consists of an AP throughput provisioning scheme and a distributed CSMA algorithm. The throughput provisioning scheme computes a robust feasible minimum AP throughput vector based on a random AP-level conflict graph and chance-constrained optimization. By incorporating the minimum throughput vector, we develop a distributed CSMA algorithm that fulfills the minimum requirement for each AP and is compatible with the IEEE 802.11 standard. We show through extensive simulations that our framework addresses the AP starvation problem by guaranteeing minimum throughput for each AP."}
