The algorithm guarantees finite buffer sizes and aims to solve a joint congestion control, routing, and scheduling problem in a multihop wireless network while satisfying per-flow average end-to-end delay constraints and minimum data rate requirements. This problem has been solved for both backlogged as well as arbitrary arrival rate systems. Moreover, we discuss the design of a class of low-complexity suboptimal algorithms, effects of delayed feedback on the optimal algorithm, and extensions of the proposed algorithm to different interference models with arbitrary link capacities."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10526","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10527","fieldValue":" In this paper, optimal resource allocation policies are characterized for wireless cognitive networks under the spectrum leasing model. We propose cooperative schemes in which secondary users share the time-slot with primary users in return for cooperation. Cooperation is feasible only if the primary system's performance is improved over the non-cooperative case. First, we investigate a scheduling problem where secondary users are interested in immediate rewards. Here, we consider both infinite and finite backlog cases. Then, we formulate another problem where the secondary users are guaranteed a portion of the primary utility, on a long-term basis, in return for cooperation. Finally, we present a power allocation problem where the goal is to maximize the expected net benefit defined as utility minus cost of energy. Our proposed scheduling policies are shown to outperform non-cooperative scheduling policies, in terms of expected utility and net benefit, for a given set of feasible constraints. Based on Lyapunov optimization techniques, we show that our schemes are arbitrarily close to the optimal performance at the price of reduced convergence rate."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10527","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10527","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10527","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10528","fieldValue":" We focus on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that perform data collection with the objective of obtaining the whole dataset at the sink (as opposed to a function of the dataset). In this case, energy-efficient data collection requires the use of data aggregation. Whereas many data aggregation schemes have been investigated, they either compromise the fidelity of the recovered data or require complicated in-network compressions. In this paper, we propose a novel data aggregation scheme that exploits compressed sensing (CS) to achieve both recovery fidelity and energy efficiency in WSNs with arbitrary topology. We make use of diffusion wavelets to find a sparse basis that characterizes the spatial (and temporal) correlations well on arbitrary WSNs, which enables straightforward CS-based data aggregation as well as high-fidelity data recovery at the sink. Based on this scheme, we investigate the minimum-energy compressed data aggregation problem. We first prove its NP-completeness, and then propose a mixed integer programming formulation along with a greedy heuristic to solve it. We evaluate our scheme by extensive simulations on both real datasets and synthetic datasets. We demonstrate that our compressed data aggregation scheme is capable of delivering data to the sink with high fidelity while achieving significant energy saving."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10528","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
