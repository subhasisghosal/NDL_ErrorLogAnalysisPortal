Key examples include social networks and service-oriented computing. Existing approaches either ignore evidence or only partially address the twin challenges of mapping evidence to trustworthiness and combining trust reports from imperfectly trusted sources. This article develops a mathematically well-formulated approach that naturally supports discounting and combining evidence-based trust reports. This article understands an agent Alice's trust in an agent Bob in terms of Alice's certainty in her belief that Bob is trustworthy. Unlike previous approaches, this article formulates certainty in terms of evidence based on a statistical measure defined over a probability distribution of the probability of positive outcomes. This definition supports important mathematical properties ensuring correct results despite conflicting evidence: (1) for a fixed amount of evidence, certainty increases as conflict in the evidence decreases and (2) for a fixed level of conflict, certainty increases as the amount of evidence increases. Moreover, despite a subtle definition of certainty, this work (3) establishes a bijection between evidence and trust spaces, enabling robust combination of trust reports and (4) provides an efficient algorithm for computing this bijection."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1192","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2683","fieldValue":"Silva, Marcel K De Carli"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2683","fieldValue":"Harvey, Nicholas J A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2683","fieldValue":" Many fast graph algorithms begin by preprocessing the graph to improve its sparsity. A common form of this is spectral sparsification, which involves removing and reweighting the edges of the graph while approximately preserving its spectral properties. This task has a more general linear algebraic formulation in terms of approximating sums of rank-one matrices. This article considers a more general task of approximating sums of symmetric, positive semidefinite matrices of arbitrary rank. We present two deterministic, polynomial time algorithms for solving this problem. The first algorithm applies the pessimistic estimators of Wigderson and Xiao, and the second involves an extension of the method of Batson, Spielman, and Srivastava. These algorithms have several applications, including sparsifiers of hypergraphs, sparse solutions to semidefinite programs, sparsifiers of unique games, and graph sparsifiers with various auxiliary constraints."}
