We observe that existing approaches do not scale well for large data sets, and indeed did not converge for the data set considered here. We present a novel clustering method TCLUST that exploits coconnectedness to efficiently cluster large, sparse expression data. We compare our approach with two existing clustering methods CAST and K-means which have been previously applied to clustering of gene-expression data with good performance results. Using a number of metrics, TCLUST is shown to be superior to or at least competitive with the other methods, while being much faster. We have applied this clustering algorithm to a genome-scale gene-expression data set and used gene set enrichment analysis to discover highly significant biological clusters.

Given two proteins A and B and threshold \\epsilon Ã\u2026, we develop an algorithm, TRiplet-based Iterative ALignment (TRIAL) for computing the transformation of B that maximizes the number of aligned residues such that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the alignment is at most \\epsilon Ã\u2026. Our algorithm is designed with the specific goal of effectively handling proteins with low similarity in primary structure, where existing algorithms perform particularly poorly. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods. TRIAL alignment brings the secondary structures of distantly related proteins to similar orientations. It also finds larger number of secondary structure matches at lower RMSD values and increased overall alignment lengths. Its classification accuracy is up to 63 percent better than other methods, including CE and DALI. TRIAL successfully aligns 83 percent of the residues from the smaller protein in reasonable time while other methods align only 29 to 65 percent of the residues for the same set of proteins."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4634","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
