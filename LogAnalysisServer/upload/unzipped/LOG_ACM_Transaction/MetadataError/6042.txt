Weighted variants of congestion games that rely on sharing costs proportional to players' weights do not generally have pure-strategy Nash equilibria. We propose a new way of assigning costs to players with weights in congestion games that recovers the important properties of the unweighted model. This method is derived from the Shapley value, and it always induces a game with a (weighted) potential function. For the special cases of weighted network cost-sharing and weighted routing games with Shapley value-based cost shares, we prove tight bounds on the worst-case inefficiency of equilibria. For weighted network cost-sharing games, we precisely calculate the price of stability for any given player weight vector, while for weighted routing games, we precisely calculate the price of anarchy, as a parameter of the set of allowable cost functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6044","fieldValue":" We study lower bounds on the query complexity of determining correlated equilibrium. In particular, we consider a query model in which an n-player game is specified via a black box that returns players' utilities at pure action profiles. In this model, we establish that in order to compute a correlated equilibrium, any deterministic algorithm must query the black box an exponential (in n) number of times."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1508","fieldValue":"Lee, Chin-Hui"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1508","fieldValue":" We propose a new approach to modeling transition information between signs in continuous Sign Language Recognition (SLR) and address some scalability issues in designing SLR systems. In contrast to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in which the transition between speech sounds is often brief and mainly addressed by the coarticulation effect, the sign transition in continuous SLR is far from being clear and usually not easily and exactly characterized. Leveraging upon hidden Markov modeling techniques from ASR, we proposed a modeling framework for continuous SLR having the following major advantages, namely: (i) the system is easy to scale up to large-vocabulary SLR; (ii) modeling of signs as well as the transitions between signs is robust even for noisy data collected in real-world SLR; and (iii) extensions to training, decoding, and adaptation are directly applicable even with new deep learning algorithms. A pair of low-cost digital gloves affordable for the deaf and hard of hearing community is used to collect a collection of training and testing data for real-world SLR interaction applications. Evaluated on 1,024 testing sentences from five signers, a word accuracy rate of 87.4&percnt; is achieved using a vocabulary of 510 words. The SLR speed is in real time, requiring an average of 0.69s per sentence. The encouraging results indicate that it is feasible to develop real-world SLR applications based on the proposed SLR framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1508","fieldValue":"Sign Transition Modeling and a Scalable Solution to Continuous Sign Language Recognition for Real-World Applications"}
