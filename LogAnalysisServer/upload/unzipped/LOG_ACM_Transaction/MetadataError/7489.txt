We determine an upper bound on the network lifetime for the MCT problem and then develop a (1+w) H (M) approximation algorithm to solve it, where is an arbitrarily small number, H(M) = Î£1â\u2030¤iâ\u2030¤M (1\/i) and M is the maximum number of targets in the sensing area of any sensor. As the protocol cost of the approximation algorithm may be high in practice, we develop a faster heuristic algorithm based on the approximation algorithm called Communication Weighted Greedy Cover (CWGC) algorithm and present a distributed implementation of the heuristic algorithm. We study the performance of the approximation algorithm and CWGC algorithm by comparing them with the lifetime upper bound and other basic algorithms that consider the coverage and connectivity problems independently. Simulation results show that the approximation algorithm and CWGC algorithm perform much better than others in terms of the network lifetime and the performance improvement can be up to 45% than the best-known basic algorithm. The lifetime obtained by our algorithms is close to the upper bound. Compared with the approximation algorithm, the CWGC algorithm can achieve a similar performance in terms of the network lifetime with a lower protocol cost."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9786","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9786","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9787","fieldValue":" We seek distributed protocols that attain the global optimum allocation of link transmitter powers and source rates in a cross-layer design of a mobile ad hoc network. Although the underlying network utility maximization is nonconvex, convexity plays a major role in our development. We provide new convexity results surrounding the Shannon capacity formula, allowing us to abandon suboptimal high-SIR approximations that have almost become entrenched in the literature. More broadly, these new results can be back-substituted into many existing problems for similar benefit. Three protocols are developed. The first is based on a convexification of the underlying problem, relying heavily on our new convexity results. We provide conditions under which it produces a globally optimum resource allocation. We show how it may be distributed through message passing for both rate- and power-allocation. Our second protocol relaxes this requirement and involves a novel sequence of convex approximations, each exploiting existing TCP protocols for source rate allocation. Message passing is only used for power control. Our convexity results again provide sufficient conditions for global optimality. Our last protocol, motivated by a desire of power control devoid of message passing, is a near optimal scheme that makes use of noise measurements and enjoys a convergence rate that is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9787","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9787","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9787","fieldValue":"ACM"}
