This article aims to understand the basic relationship between DFA characteristics and memory requirements, and to design a practical memory-based pattern matching engine. We present a methodology that consists of theoretical DFA characterization, encoding optimization, and implementation architecture. Results show the validity of the characterization metrics, effectiveness of the encoding techniques, and efficiency of the memory-based pattern engines."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1729","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1729","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8061","fieldValue":" Recent years have witnessed data explosion in semiconductor manufacturing due to advances in instrumentation and storage techniques. The large amount of data associated with process variables monitored over time form a rich reservoir of information, which can be used for a variety of purposes, such as anomaly detection, quality control, and fault diagnostics. In particular, following the same recipe for a certain Integrated Circuit device, multiple tools and chambers can be deployed for the production of this device, during which multiple time series can be collected, such as temperature, impedance, gas flow, electric bias, etc. These time series naturally fit into a two-dimensional array (matrix), i.e., each element in this array corresponds to a time series for one process variable from one chamber. To leverage the rich structural information in such temporal data, in this article, we propose a novel framework named C-Struts to simultaneously cluster on the two dimensions of this array. In this framework, we interpret the structural information as a set of constraints on the cluster membership, introduce an auxiliary probability distribution accordingly, and design an iterative algorithm to assign each time series to a certain cluster on each dimension. Furthermore, we establish the equivalence between C-Struts and a generic optimization problem, which is able to accommodate various distance functions. Extensive experiments on synthetic, benchmark, as well as manufacturing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8061","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8062","fieldValue":"Hemmatyar, Ali M A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8062","fieldValue":" Online media play an important role in information societies by providing a convenient infrastructure for different processes. Information diffusion that is a fundamental process taking place on social and information networks has been investigated in many studies. Research on information diffusion in these networks faces two main challenges: (1) In most cases, diffusion takes place on an underlying network, which is latent and its structure is unknown. (2) This latent network is not fixed and changes over time. In this article, we investigate the diffusion network extraction (DNE) problem when the underlying network is dynamic and latent. We model the diffusion behavior (existence probability) of each edge as a stochastic process and utilize the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to discover the most probable diffusion links according to the current observation of the diffusion process, which is the infection time of nodes and the past diffusion behavior of links. We evaluate the performance of our Dynamic Diffusion Network Extraction (DDNE) method, on both synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is independent of the cascade transmission model and outperforms the state of art method in terms of F-measure."}
