In particular, in the current state-of-the-art mobile multimedia systems, it is highly desirable to detect and locate certain objects within a video frame in real time. Although a significant number of Object Detection and Recognition schemes have been developed and implemented, triggering very accurate results, the vast majority of them cannot be applied in state-of-the-art mobile multimedia devices; this is mainly due to the fact that they are highly complex schemes that require a significant amount of processing power, while they are also time consuming and very power hungry. In this article, we present a novel FPGA-based embedded implementation of a very efficient object recognition algorithm called Receptive Field Cooccurrence Histograms Algorithm (RFCH). Our main focus was to increase its performance so as to be able to handle the object recognition task of today's highly sophisticated embedded multimedia systems while keeping its energy consumption at very low levels. Our low-power embedded reconfigurable system is at least 15 times faster than the software implementation on a low-voltage high-end CPU, while consuming at least 60 times less energy. Our novel system is also 88 times more energy efficient than the recently introduced low-power multi-core Intel devices which are optimized for embedded systems. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first system presented that can execute the complete complex object recognition task at a multi frame per second rate while consuming minimal amounts of energy, making it an ideal candidate for future embedded multimedia systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6629","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6629","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6630","fieldValue":" Streaming applications often require a parallel Model of Computation (MoC) to specify their application behavior and to facilitate mapping onto Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) platforms. Various performance requirements and resource budgets of embedded systems ask for an efficient design space exploration (DSE) approach to select the best design from a design space consisting of a large number of design choices. However, existing DSE approaches explore the design space that includes only architecture and mapping alternatives for an initial application specification given by the application designer. In this article, we first show that a design often might not be optimal if alternative specifications of a given application are not taken into account. We further argue that the best alternative specification consists of only independent and load-balanced application tasks. Based on the Polyhedral Process Network (PPN) MoC, we present an approach to analyze and transform an initial PPN to an alternative one that contains only independent processes if possible. Finally, by prototyping real-life applications on both FPGA-based MPSoCs and desktop multi-core platforms, we demonstrate that mapping the alternative application specification results in a large performance gain compared to those approaches, in which alternative application specifications are not taken into account."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6630","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6630","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6631","fieldValue":"Hausmans, Joost P H M"}
