We propose a third approach called preview streaming for mesh-based 3D objects: by streaming and showing parts of the mesh surfaces visible along the virtual camera path. This article focuses on the preview streaming architecture and framework and presents our investigation into how such a system would best handle network congestion effectively. We present three basic methods: (a) stop-and-wait, where the camera pauses until sufficient data is buffered; (b) reduce-speed, where the camera slows down in accordance to reduce network bandwidth; and (c) reduce-quality, where the camera continues to move at the same speed but fewer vertices are sent and displayed, leading to lower mesh quality. We further propose two advanced methods: (d) keyview-aware, which trades off mesh quality and camera speed appropriately depending on how close the current view is to the keyviews, and (e) adaptive-zoom, which improves visual quality by moving the virtual camera away from the original path. A user study reveals that our keyview-aware method is preferred over the basic methods. Moreover, the adaptive-zoom scheme compares favorably to the keyview-aware method, showing that path adaptation is a viable approach to handling bandwidth variation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25549","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25549","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25550","fieldValue":"Landsverk, stein"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25550","fieldValue":" The importance of winning has increased the role of performance analysis in the sports industry, and this underscores how statistics and technology keep changing the way sports are played. Thus, this is a growing area of interest, both from a computer system view in managing the technical challenges and from a sport performance view in aiding the development of athletes. In this respect, Bagadus is a real-time prototype of a sports analytics application using soccer as a case study. Bagadus integrates a sensor system, a soccer analytics annotations system, and a video processing system using a video camera array. A prototype is currently installed at Alfheim Stadium in Norway, and in this article, we describe how the system can be used in real-time to playback events. The system supports both stitched panorama video and camera switching modes and creates video summaries based on queries to the sensor system. Moreover, we evaluate the system from a systems point of view, benchmarking different approaches, algorithms, and trade-offs, and show how the system runs in real time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25550","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3468","fieldValue":" A study on the role of cutaneous and kinesthetic force feedback in teleoperation is presented. Cutaneous cues provide less transparency than kinesthetic force, but they do not affect the stability of the teleoperation system. On the other hand, kinesthesia provides a compelling illusion of telepresence but affects the stability of the haptic loop. However, when employing common grounded haptic interfaces, it is not possible to independently control the cutaneous and kinesthetic components of the interaction. For this reason, many control techniques ensure a stable interaction by scaling down both kinesthetic and cutaneous force feedback, even though acting on the cutaneous channel is not necessary. We discuss here the feasibility of a novel approach. It aims at improving the realism of the haptic rendering, while preserving its stability, by modulating cutaneous force to compensate for a lack of kinesthesia. We carried out two teleoperation experiments, evaluating (1) the role of cutaneous stimuli when reducing kinesthesia and (2) the extent to which an overactuation of the cutaneous channel can fully compensate for a lack of kinesthetic force feedback. Results showed that, to some extent, it is possible to compensate for a lack of kinesthesia with the aforementioned technique, without significant performance degradation. Moreover, users showed a high comfort level in using the proposed system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3468","fieldValue":"ACM"}
