Gaining insight into the complex interaction between clean speech, noise, and noisy reverberant speech features is essential for any ASR system to be robust against noise and reverberation present in distant microphone input signals. The findings are gathered in a probabilistic formulation of an observation model which may be used in model-based feature compensation schemes. The proposed observation model extends previous models in three major directions: First, the contribution of additive background noise to the observation error is explicitly taken into account. Second, an energy compensation constant is introduced which ensures an unbiased estimate of the reverberant speech features, and, third, a recursive variant of the observation model is developed resulting in reduced computational complexity when used in model-based feature compensation. The experimental section is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model and to describe how its parameters can be determined from test data."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3591","fieldValue":"A New Observation Model in the Logarithmic Mel Power Spectral Domain for the Automatic Recognition of Noisy Reverberant Speech"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3591","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3591","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3592","fieldValue":"Wade Shen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3592","fieldValue":" In this work, we propose a framework that automatically discovers dialect-specific phonetic rules. These rules characterize when certain phonetic or acoustic transformations occur across dialects. To explicitly characterize these dialect-specific rules, we adapt the conventional hidden Markov model to handle insertion and deletion transformations. The proposed framework is able to convert pronunciation of one dialect to another using learned rules, recognize dialects using learned rules, retrieve dialect-specific regions, and refine linguistic rules. Potential applications of our proposed framework include computer-assisted language learning, sociolinguistics, and diagnosis tools for phonological disorders."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3592","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3592","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3593","fieldValue":" Estimating the geometric and reflective properties of the environment is important for a wide range of applications of space-time audio processing, from acoustic scene analysis to room equalization and spatial audio rendering. In this manuscript, we propose a methodology for frequency-subband in-situ estimation of the reflection coefficients of planar surfaces. This is a rather challenging task, as the reflection coefficients depend on the frequency and the angle of incidence and their estimate is highly sensitive to background noise and interfering sources. Our method is based on the assumption that we know the geometry of the reflectors; the position and the radiation pattern of the source; the position and the spatial response of the array. Applying beamforming algorithms on a single set of measured sensor data, we estimate the angular distribution of the acoustic energy (angular pseudospectrum) that impinges on a microphone array. We then apply a two-step iterative estimation technique based on an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The first step estimates the scaling factors. The second one infers the reflection coefficients from the scaling factors. Under the assumption of additive white Gaussian noise, we finally determine the reflection coefficients with a Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation method. The effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed technique are assessed through experiments based on measured data."}
