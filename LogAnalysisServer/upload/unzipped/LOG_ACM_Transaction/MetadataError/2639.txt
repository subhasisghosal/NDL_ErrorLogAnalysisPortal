ToBI is a multitier representation system based on linguistic knowledge that transcribes events in an utterance. The TTS (Text-To-Speech) system, which adopts ToBI as an intermediate representation, is known to exhibit higher flexibility, modularity, and domain\/task portability compared to the direct prosody generation TTS systems. However, for practical-level performance, the cost of corpus preparation is very expensive because the ToBI labeled corpus is constructed manually by many prosody experts, and normally requires large amounts of data for statistical prosody modeling. Unlike previous ToBI-based systems, this article proposes a new method, which transcribes the K-ToBI labels in Korean speech completely automatically. We develop automatic corpus-based K-ToBI labeling tools and prediction methods based on several lexico-syntactic linguistic features for decision-tree induction. We demonstrate the performance of F0 generation from automatically predicted K-ToBI labels, and confirm that the performance is reasonably comparable to state-of-the-art direct prosody generation methods and previous ToBI-based methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2825","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2825","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18854","fieldValue":" Formulas developed originally by Weierstrass have been used since the 1960s by many others for the simultaneous determination of all the roots of a polynomial. Convergence to simple roots is quadratic, but individual approximations to a multiple root converge only linearly. However, it is shown here that the mean of such individual approximations converges quadratically to that root. This result, along with some detail about the behavior of such approximations in the neighborhood of the multiple root, suggests a new approach to the design of polynomial rootfinders. It should also be noted that the technique is well suited to take advantage of a parallel environment. This article first provides the relevant mathematical results: a short derivation of the formulas, convergence proofs, an indication of the behavior near a multiple root, and some error bounds. It then provides the outline of an algorithm based on these results, along with some graphical and numerical results to illustrate the major theoretical points. Finally, a new program based on this algorithm, but with a more efficient way of choosing starting values, is described and then compared with corresponding programs from IMSL and NAG with good results.
