V S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18581","fieldValue":" Many iterative algorithms for the solution of large linear systems may be effectively vectorized if the diagonal of the matrix is surrounded by a large band of zeroes, whose width is called the zero stretch. In this paper, a multicolor numbering technique is suggested for maximizing the zero stretch of irregularly sparse matrices. The technique, which is a generalization of a known multicoloring algorithm for regularly sparse matrices, executes in linear time, and produces a zero stretch approximately equal to n\/2&sgr;, where 2&sgr; is the number of colors used in the algorithm. For triangular meshes, it is shown that &sgr; â\u2030¤ 3, and that it is possible to obtain &sgr; = 2 by applying a simple backtracking scheme."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18581","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18581","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18582","fieldValue":" This paper presents a method of constructing a smooth function of two or more variables that interpolates data values at arbitrarily distributed points. Shepard's method for fitting a surface to data values at scattered points in the plane has the advantages of a small storage requirement and an easy generalization to more than two independent variables, but suffers from low accuracy and a high computational cost relative to some alternative methods. Localizations of this method have reasonably low computational costs, but remain relatively inaccurate. We describe a modified Shepard's method that, without sacrificing the advantages, has accuracy comparable to other local methods. Computational efficiency is also improved by using a cell method for nearest-neighbor searching. Test results for two and three independent variables are presented."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18582","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18582","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18583","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18583","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18584","fieldValue":"ACM"}
