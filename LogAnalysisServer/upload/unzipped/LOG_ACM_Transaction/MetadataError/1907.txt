{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16607","fieldValue":" With the increasing demands for photo-realistic image synthesis in real time, we propose a sparse multilinear model, which is named K-Clustered Tensor Approximation (K-CTA), to efficiently analyze and approximate large-scale multidimensional visual datasets, so that both storage space and rendering time are substantially reduced. K-CTA not only extends previous work on Clustered Tensor Approximation (CTA) to exploit inter-cluster coherence, but also allows a compact and sparse representation for high-dimensional datasets with just a few low-order factors and reduced multidimensional cluster core tensors. Thus, K-CTA can be regarded as a sparse extension of CTA and a multilinear generalization of sparse representation. Experimental results demonstrate that K-CTA can accurately approximate spatially varying visual datasets, such as bidirectional texture functions, view-dependent occlusion texture functions, and biscale radiance transfer functions for efficient rendering in real-time applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16607","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16607","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16608","fieldValue":" The reflectance function of a scene point captures the appearance of that point as a function of lighting direction. We present an approach to printing the reflectance functions of an object or scene so that its appearance is modified correctly as a function of the lighting conditions when viewing the print. For example, such a â\u20ACœphotographâ\u20AC? of a statue printed with our approach appears to cast shadows to the right when the â\u20ACœphotographâ\u20AC? is illuminated from the left. Viewing the same print with lighting from the right will cause the statue's shadows to be cast to the left. Beyond shadows, all effects due to the lighting variation, such as Lambertian shading, specularity, and inter-reflection can be reproduced. We achieve this ability by geometrically and photometrically controlling specular highlights on the surface of the print. For a particular viewpoint, arbitrary reflectance functions can be built up at each pixel by controlling only the specular highlights and avoiding significant diffuse reflections. Our initial binary prototype uses halftoning to approximate continuous grayscale reflectance functions."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16608","fieldValue":"BRDF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16609","fieldValue":" The problem of decomposing a 3D mesh into meaningful segments (or parts) is of great practical importance in computer graphics. This article presents a variational mesh decomposition algorithm that can efficiently partition a mesh into a prescribed number of segments. The algorithm extends the Mumford-Shah model to 3D meshes that contains a data term measuring the variation within a segment using eigenvectors of a dual Laplacian matrix whose weights are related to the dihedral angle between adjacent triangles and a regularization term measuring the length of the boundary between segments. Such a formulation simultaneously handles segmentation and boundary smoothing, which are usually two separate processes in most previous work. The efficiency is achieved by solving the Mumford-Shah model through a saddle-point problem that is solved by a fast primal-dual method. A preprocess step is also proposed to determine the number of segments that the mesh should be decomposed into. By incorporating this preprocessing step, the proposed algorithm can automatically segment a mesh into meaningful parts. Furthermore, user interaction is allowed by incorporating the user's inputs into the variational model to reflect the user's special intention. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms competitive segmentation methods when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16609","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16609","fieldValue":"ACM"}
