In this article, we study answering range queries over uncertain data. Specifically, we are given a collection P of n uncertain points in â\u201E?, each represented by its one-dimensional probability density function (pdf). The goal is to build a data structure on P such that, given a query interval I and a probability threshold Ï\u201E, we can quickly report all points of P that lie in I with probability at least Ï\u201E. We present various structures with linear or near-linear space and (poly)logarithmic query time. Our structures support pdf's that are either histograms or more complex ones such as Gaussian or piecewise algebraic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2560","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16452","fieldValue":"Akenine-Mller, Tomas"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16452","fieldValue":" We present a novel visibility algorithm for rendering motion blur with per-pixel anti-aliasing. Our algorithm uses a number of line samples over a rectangular group of pixels, and together with the time dimension, a two-dimensional spatio-temporal visibility problem needs to be solved per line sample. In a coarse culling step, our algorithm first uses a bounding volume hierarchy to rapidly remove geometry that does not overlap with the current line sample. For the remaining triangles, we approximate each triangle's depth function, along the line and along the time dimension, with a number of patch triangles. We resolve for the final color using an analytical visibility algorithm with depth sorting, simple occlusion culling, and clipping. Shading is decoupled from visibility, and we use a shading cache for efficient reuse of shaded values. In our results, we show practically noise-free renderings of motion blur with high-quality spatial anti-aliasing and with competitive rendering times. We also demonstrate that our algorithm, with some adjustments, can be used to accurately compute motion blurred ambient occlusion."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16452","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16453","fieldValue":" Traditionally, effects that require evaluating multidimensional integrals for each pixel, such as motion blur, depth of field, and soft shadows, suffer from noise due to the variance of the high-dimensional integrand. In this paper, we describe a general reconstruction technique that exploits the anisotropy in the temporal light field and permits efficient reuse of samples between pixels, multiplying the effective sampling rate by a large factor. We show that our technique can be applied in situations that are challenging or impossible for previous anisotropic reconstruction methods, and that it can yield good results with very sparse inputs. We demonstrate our method for simultaneous motion blur, depth of field, and soft shadows."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16453","fieldValue":"ACM"}
