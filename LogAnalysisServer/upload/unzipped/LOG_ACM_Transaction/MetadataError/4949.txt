They vary greatly in their utility, depending on user expertise. We focus on nonprofessional, occasional users. Such users may spend from a few seconds up to a few minutes to select a color. Yet, typically they reach final accuracy within the initial 20s. Additional effort leads to random walks in the neighborhood of the target. We explore the efficaciousness of five generic color pickers, analyzing the results in terms of generic user interface properties. There is a major dichotomy between three-slider interfaces, and those that offer some form of 2D selectivity. The accuracy in rgb coordinates is about one-tenth to one-twentieth of the full scale (often 0--255 in r, g, and b), whereas a little over 100 hues are resolved. The most efficient color picker, which is presently rarely used in popular applications, is much more efficient than the worst one. We speculate that this derives from a closer match to the userâ\u20AC™s internal representation of color space. The study results in explicit recommendations for the implementation of user-friendly and efficient color tools."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3525","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3526","fieldValue":" Subjective image-quality estimation with high-quality images is often a preference-estimation task. Preferences are subjective, and individual differences exist. Individual differences are also seen in the eye movements of people. A task's subjectivity can result from people using different rules as a basis for their estimation. Using two studies, we investigated whether different preference-estimation rules are related to individual differences in viewing behaviour by examining the process of preference estimation of high-quality images. The estimation rules were measured from free subjective reports on important quality-related attributes (Study 1) and from estimations of the attributesâ\u20AC™ importance in preference estimation (Study 2). The free reports showed that the observers used both feature-based image-quality attributes (e.g., sharpness, illumination) and abstract attributes, which include an interpretation of the image features (e.g., atmosphere and naturalness). In addition, the observers were classified into three viewing-strategy groups differing in fixation durations in both studies. These groups also used different estimation rules. In both studies, the group with medium-length fixations differed in their estimation rules from the other groups. In Study 1, the observers in this group used more abstract attributes than those in the other groups; in Study 2, they considered atmosphere to be a more important image feature. The study shows that individual differences in a quality-estimation task are related to both estimation rules and viewing strategies, and that the difference is related to the level of abstraction of the estimations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3526","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3527","fieldValue":" Eye tracking is one of the most exploited techniques in literature for finding usability problems in web-based user interfaces (UIs). However, it is usually employed in a laboratory setting, considering that an eye-tracker is not commonly used in web browsing. In contrast, web application providers usually exploit remote techniques for large-scale user studies (e.g. A\/B testing), tracking low-level interactions such as mouse clicks and movements. In this article, we discuss a method for predicting whether the user is looking at the content pointed by the cursor, exploiting the mouse movement data and a segmentation of the contents in a web page. We propose an automatic method for segmenting content groups inside a web page that, applying both image and code analysis techniques, identifies the user-perceived group of contents with a mean pixel-based error around the 20&percnt;. In addition, we show through a user study that such segmentation information enhances the precision and the accuracy in predicting the correlation between between the userâ\u20AC™s gaze and the mouse position at the content level, without relaying on user-specific features."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/3527","fieldValue":"User&rsquo;s attention"}
