The PDZ is one of the most common and well-studied protein binding domains, hence it is a perfect model system for designing protein binding predictors. The standard approach to identifying the binding partners of PDZ domains uses multiple sequence alignments to infer the set of contact residues that are used in a predictive model. We expand on the sequence alignment approach by incorporating structural information to generate descriptors of the binding site geometry. Furthermore, we generate a real-value score for binary predictions by applying a filter based on models that predict the probability distributions of contact residues at each of the canonical PDZ ligand binding positions. Under training cross validation, our model produced an order of magnitude more predictions at a false positive proportion (FPP) of 10 percent than our benchmark model chosen from the literature. Evaluated using an independent cross validation, with computationally predicted structures, our model was able to make five times as many predictions as the benchmark model, with a Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.33. In addition, our model achieved a false positive proportion of 0.14, while the benchmark model had a 0.25 false positive proportion."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4831","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4831","fieldValue":"Peptides,Proteins,Encoding,Predictive models,Probability distribution,Computational modeling,Data models,protein structure classification.,PDZ binding,protein binding prediction,machine learning"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4831","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4831","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1412","fieldValue":"Newell, Alan F"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1412","fieldValue":" This article gives a personal perspective on Glinert and York's 1992 paper, focusing on whether and how the situation has changed over the past 15 years, and makes recommendations for the future of the field of accessible computing with a particular focus on the needs of older people and people with cognitive dysfunction."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1412","fieldValue":"Accessible Computing -- Past Trends and Future Suggestions: Commentary on â\u20ACœComputers and People with Disabilitiesâ\u20AC?"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1412","fieldValue":"ACM"}
