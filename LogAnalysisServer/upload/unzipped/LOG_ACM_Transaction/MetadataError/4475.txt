{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24442","fieldValue":" This article proposes a new delivery-centric abstraction which extends the existing content-centric networking API. A delivery-centric abstraction allows applications to generate content requests agnostic to location or protocol, with the additional ability to stipulate high-level requirements regarding such things as performance, security, and resource consumption. Fulfilling these requirements, however, is complex as often the ability of a provider to satisfy requirements will vary between different consumers and over time. Therefore, we argue that it is vital to manage this variance to ensure an application fulfils its needs. To this end, we present the Juno middleware, which implements delivery-centric support using a reconfigurable software architecture to: (i) discover multiple sources of an item of content; (ii) model each sourceâ\u20AC™s ability to provide the content; then (iii) adapt to interact with the source(s) that can best fulfil the applicationâ\u20AC™s requirements. Juno therefore utilizes existing providers in a backwards compatible way, supporting immediate deployment. This article evaluates Juno using Emulab to validate its ability to adapt to its environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24442","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24443","fieldValue":"La Poutr, Han"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24443","fieldValue":" We propose a priced options model for solving the exposure problem of bidders with valuation synergies participating in a sequence of online auctions. We consider a setting in which complementary-valued items are offered sequentially by different sellers, who have the choice of either selling their item directly or through a priced option. In our model, the seller fixes the exercise price for this option, and then sells it through a first-price auction. We analyze this model from a decision-theoretic perspective and we show, for a setting where the competition is formed by local bidders (which desire a single item), that using options can increase the expected profit for both sides. Furthermore, we derive the equations that provide minimum and maximum bounds between which the bids of the synergy buyer are expected to fall, in order for both sides of the market to have an incentive to use the options mechanism. Next, we perform an experimental analysis of a market in which multiple synergy buyers are active simultaneously. We show that, despite the extra competition, some synergy buyers may benefit, because sellers are forced to set their exercise prices for options at levels which encourage participation of all buyers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24443","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24443","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24444","fieldValue":" Keyword query is a user-friendly mechanism for retrieving useful information from XML data in Web and scientific applications.

Then we develop an XML keyword search engine that leverages materialized views for query evaluation and maintains materialized views incrementally upon XML data update. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the significance and efficiency of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24444","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24444","fieldValue":"ACM"}
