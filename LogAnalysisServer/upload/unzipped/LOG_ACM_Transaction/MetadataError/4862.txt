{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25618","fieldValue":" Maintenance and upgrades to the significant storage infrastructure in a video server often create a heterogenous disk array. We show how to manage the energy consumption of such an array by combining caching and prefetching techniques. We first examine how seek operations affect disk energy consumption, and then analyze the relationship between the amount of prefetched data and the number of seeks, and the effect of the size of the prefetching buffer on energy consumption. Based on this, we propose a new data prefetching scheme in which the amount of data prefetched for each video stream is dynamically adjusted to allow for the bit-rates of streams and the power characteristics of different disks. We next examine the impact of caching on disk power consumption and propose a new caching scheme that prioritizes each stream based on the ratio of the amount of energy that can be saved to its cache requirement, so as to make effective use of limited caching space. We address the trade-off between caching and prefetching and propose an algorithm that dynamically divides the entire buffer space into prefetching and caching regions, with the aim of minimizing overall disk energy consumption. Experimental results show that our scheme can reduce disk energy consumption between 26&percnt; and 31&percnt;, compared to a server without prefetching and caching."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25618","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25619","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25620","fieldValue":"Chan, S-H Gary"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25620","fieldValue":" IPTV services deployed nowadays often consist of both live TV and Video-on-Demand (VoD), offered by the same service provider to the same pool of users over the same managed network. Understanding user behaviors in such a setting is hence an important step for system modelling and optimization. Previous studies on user behavior on video services were on either live TV or VoD. For the first time, we conduct an in-depth large-scale behavior study for IPTV users offering simultaneously live TV and VoD choices at the same time. Our data is from the largest IPTV service provider in China, offering hundreds of live channels and hundreds of thousands of VoD files, with traces covering more than 1.9 million users over a period of 5 months. This large dataset provides us a unique opportunity to cross-compare user viewing behaviors for these services on the same platform, and sheds valuable insights on how users interact with such a simultaneous system. Our results lead to new understanding on IPTV user behaviors which have strong implications on system design. For example, we find that the average holding time for VoD is significantly longer than live TV. live TV users tend to surf more. However, if such channel surfing is discounted, the holding times of both services are not much different. While users in VoD tend to view HD longer, channel popularity for live TV is much less dependent on its video quality. In contrast to some popular assumptions on user interactivity, the transitions among live TV, VoD, and offline modes are far from a Markov model."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25620","fieldValue":"IPTV"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25620","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25620","fieldValue":"ACM"}
