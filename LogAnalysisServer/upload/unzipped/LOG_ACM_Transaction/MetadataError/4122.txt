In this article, we explore a novel semantic approach to contextual advertising. This consists of three tasks: (1) building a well-organized hierarchical taxonomy of topics, (2) developing a robust classifier for effectively finding the topics of pages and ads, and (3) ranking ads based on the topical relevance to pages. First, we heuristically build our own taxonomy of topics from the Open Directory Project (ODP). Second, we investigate how to increase classification accuracy by taking the unique characteristics of the ODP into account. Last, we measure the topical relevance of ads by applying a link analysis technique to the similarity graph carefully derived from our taxonomy. Experiments show that our classification method improves the performance of $Ma-F_1$ by as much as 25.7&percnt; over the baseline classifier. In addition, our ranking method enhances the relevance of ads substantially, up to 10&percnt; in terms of precision at k, compared to a representative strategy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3271","fieldValue":" JPEG compression of the left and right components of a stereo image pair is a way to save valuable bandwidth when transmitting stereoscopic images. This paper presents results on the effects of camera-base distance (B) and JPEG coding on overall image quality, perceived depth, perceived sharpness, and perceived eye strain. In the experiment, two stereoscopic still scenes were used, varying in depth (three different camera-base distances: 0, 8, and 12 cm) and compression ratio (4 levels: original, 1:30, 1:40, and 1:60). All levels of compression were applied to both the left and right stereo image, resulting in a 4 Ã\u2014 4 matrix of all possible symmetric and asymmetric coding combinations. The observers were asked to assess image quality, sharpness, depth, and eye strain. Results showed that an increase in JPEG coding had a negative effect on image quality, sharpness, and eye strain, but had no effect on perceived depth. An increase in camera-base distance increased perceived depth and reported eye strain, but had no effect on perceived sharpness. Results on asymmetric and symmetric coding showed that the relationship between perceived image quality and average bit rate is not straightforward. In some cases, image quality ratings of a symmetric coded pair can be higher than for an asymmetric coded pair, even if the averaged bit rate for the symmetric pair is lower, than for the asymmetric pair. Furthermore, sharpness and eye strain correlated highly and medium, respectively, with perceived image quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3271","fieldValue":"Perceived quality of compressed stereoscopic images: Effects of symmetric and asymmetric JPEG coding and camera separation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23282","fieldValue":" Services are an indispensable component in cloud computing. Web services are particularly important. As an increasing number of Web services provides equivalent functions, one common issue faced by users is the selection of the most appropriate one based on quality. This article presents a conceptual framework that characterizes the quality of Web services, an algorithm that quantifies them, and a system architecture that ranks Web services by using the proposed algorithm. In particular, the algorithm, called UsageQoS that computes the scores of quality of service (QoS) of Web services within a community, makes use of the usage frequencies of Web services. The frequencies are defined as the numbers of times invoked by other services in a given time period. The UsageQoS algorithm is able to optionally take user ratings as its initial input. The proposed approach has been validated by extensively experimenting on several datasets, including two real datasets. The results of the experiments have demonstrated that our approach is capable of estimating QoS parameters of Web services, regardless of whether user ratings are available or not."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23282","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23282","fieldValue":"ACM"}
