A specialized camera mount, in combination with an automated pipeline for alignment, exposure compensation, and stitching, provide the means to acquire Gigapixel images with a standard camera and lens. More importantly, our novel viewer enables exploration of such images at interactive rates over a network, while dynamically and smoothly interpolating the projection between perspective and curved projections, and simultaneously modifying the tone-mapping to ensure an optimal view of the portion of the scene being viewed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15849","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15849","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15850","fieldValue":" We describe a hierarchical approach to improving the efficiency of gradient-domain compositing, a technique that constructs seamless composites by combining the gradients of images into a vector field that is then integrated to form a composite. While gradient-domain compositing is powerful and widely used, it suffers from poor scalability. Computing an n pixel composite requires solving a linear system with n variables; solving such a large system quickly overwhelms the main memory of a standard computer when performed for multi-megapixel composites, which are common in practice. In this paper we show how to perform gradient-domain compositing approximately by solving an O(p) linear system, where p is the total length of the seams between image regions in the composite; for typical cases, p is O(âˆšn). We achieve this reduction by transforming the problem into a space where much of the solution is smooth, and then utilize the pattern of this smoothness to adaptively subdivide the problem domain using quadtrees. We demonstrate the merits of our approach by performing panoramic stitching and image region copy-and-paste in significantly reduced time and memory while achieving visually identical results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15850","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15850","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15851","fieldValue":" In this paper we propose a new method for upsampling images which is capable of generating sharp edges with reduced input-resolution grid-related artifacts. The method is based on a statistical edge dependency relating certain edge features of two different resolutions, which is generically exhibited by real-world images. While other solutions assume some form of smoothness, we rely on this distinctive edge dependency as our prior knowledge in order to increase image resolution. In addition to this relation we require that intensities are conserved; the output image must be identical to the input image when downsampled to the original resolution. Altogether the method consists of solving a constrained optimization problem, attempting to impose the correct edge relation and conserve local intensities with respect to the low-resolution input image. Results demonstrate the visual importance of having such edge features properly matched, and the method's capability to produce images in which sharp edges are successfully reconstructed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15851","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15852","fieldValue":" Image analysis and enhancement tasks such as tone mapping, colorization, stereo depth, and photomontage, often require computing a solution (e.g., for exposure, chromaticity, disparity, labels) over the pixel grid. Computational and memory costs often require that a smaller solution be run over a downsampled image. Although general purpose upsampling methods can be used to interpolate the low resolution solution to the full resolution, these methods generally assume a smoothness prior for the interpolation. We demonstrate that in cases, such as those above, the available high resolution input image may be leveraged as a prior in the context of a joint bilateral upsampling procedure to produce a better high resolution solution. We show results for each of the applications above and compare them to traditional upsampling methods."}
