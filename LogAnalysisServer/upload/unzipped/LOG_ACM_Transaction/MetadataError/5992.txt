Drawing on ethnographic studies of two major advertising campaigns, we highlight key concerns for integrating sensors and sensor data into film production. Our findings address the perceived benefits of using biodata within narratives; the nature of different on-screen representations of biodata; and the challenges presented when integrating biodata into production processes. Drawing on this, we reconsider the nature of information visualization in the filmmaking context. Further implications from our case studies provide recommendations for human--computer interaction (HCI) collaborations with filmmaking and broadcast industries, focusing both on the practical matters of fitting sensor technologies into and handling data within production workflows, as well as discussing the broader implications for managing the veracity of that data within professional media production."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5895","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5895","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5896","fieldValue":"Tarpin-Bernard, Franck"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5896","fieldValue":" In this article, we introduce CLBCI (Co-Learning for Brain--Computer Interfaces), a BCI architecture based on co-learning in which users can give explicit feedback to the system rather than just receiving feedback. CLBCI is based on minimum distance classification with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and allows for shorter training times compared to classical BCIs, as well as faster learning in users and a good performance progression. We further propose a new scheme for real-time two-dimensional visualization of classification outcomes using Wachspress coordinate interpolation. It allows us to represent classification outcomes for n classes in simple regular polygons. Our objective is to devise a BCI system that constitutes a practical interaction modality that can be deployed rapidly and used on a regular basis. We apply our system to an event-based control task in the form of a simple shooter game in which we evaluate the learning effect induced by our architecture compared to a classical approach. We also evaluate how much user feedback and our visualization method contribute to the performance of the system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5896","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5896","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5897","fieldValue":"Leiva, Luis A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5897","fieldValue":" The need to modify an application so that it can support different languages and cultural settings can appear once the application is finished and even in the market. This may introduce serious time delays and an increase in costs. We solve this problem for web-based software through JITL, a post-hoc method to automatically internationalize websites and web-based applications, without having to modify the source code. With JITL, users can pull resource strings out of an arbitrary website and perform on-demand localization tasks. Based on this novel capability, JITL enables a complete infrastructure for collecting, storing, sharing, and delivering website translations, which invokes a number of exciting scenarios. Our studies show that JITL leads to significant savings in terms of user effort and, in consequence, money. With JITL, now it is possible to localize what is needed, when it is needed."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5897","fieldValue":"JIT"}
