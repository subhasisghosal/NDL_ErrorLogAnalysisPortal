Although such systems seem deceptively simple, a considerable amount of skill is required in order to satisfy non-trivial information needs. This paper presents a new conceptual paradigm for performing search in context, that largely automates the search process, providing even non-professional users with highly relevant results. This paradigm is implemented in practice in the IntelliZap system, where search is initiated from a text query marked by the user in a document she views, and is guided by the text surrounding the marked query in that document (\"the context\"). The context-driven information retrieval process involves semantic keyword extraction and clustering to automatically generate new, augmented queries. The latter are submitted to a host of general and domain-specific search engines. Search results are then semantically reranked, using context. Experimental results testify that using context to guide search, effectively offers even inexperienced users an advanced search tool on the Web."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23847","fieldValue":"Garcia-Molina, Hector"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23847","fieldValue":" Data archiving systems rely on replication to preserve information. This paper discusses how a network of autonomous archiving sites can trade data to achieve the most reliable replication. A series of binary trades among sites produces a peer-to-peer archiving network. Two trading algorithms are examined, one based on trading collections (even if they are different sizes) and another based on trading equal sized blocks of space (which can then store collections). The concept of deeds is introduced; deeds track the blocks of space owned by one site at another. Policies for tuning these algorithms to provide the highest reliability, for example by changing the order in which sites are contacted and offered trades, are discussed. Finally, simulation results are presented that reveal which policies are best. The experiments indicate that a digital archive can achieve the best reliability by trading blocks of space (deeds), and that following certain policies will allow that site to maximize its reliability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23847","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23847","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23848","fieldValue":"McCabe, Mary Catherine"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23848","fieldValue":" We present a new algorithm for duplicate document detection thatuses collection statistics.

Thesecollections include a 30 MB 18,577 web document collectiondeveloped by Excite@Home and three NIST collections. The first NISTcollection consists of 100 MB 18,232 LA-Times documents, which isroughly similar in the number of documents to theExcite&at;Home collection. The other two collections are both 2GB and are the 247,491-web document collection and the TREC disks 4and 5---528,023 document collection. We show that our approachcalled I-Match, scales in terms of the number of documents andworks well for documents of all sizes. We compared our solution tothe state of the art and found that in addition to improvedaccuracy of detection, our approach executed in roughly one-fifththe time."}
