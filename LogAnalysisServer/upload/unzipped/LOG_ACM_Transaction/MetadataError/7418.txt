Various mobility models have been studied in the literature, and the delay-capacity relationships under those models have been characterized. The results indicate that there are trade-offs between the delay and capacity, and that the nature of these trade-offs is strongly influenced by the choice of the mobility model. Some questions that arise are: (i) How representative are these mobility models studied in the literature? (ii) Can the delay-capacity relationship be significantly different under some other \"reasonable\" mobility model? (iii) What sort of delay-capacity trade-off are we likely to see in a real world scenario? In this paper, we take the first step toward answering some of these questions. In particular, we analyze, among others, the mobility models studied in recent related works, under a unified framework. We relate the nature of delay-capacity trade-off to the nature of node motion, thereby providing a better understanding of the delay-capacity relationship in ad hoc networks in comparison to earlier works."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9647","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9647","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9648","fieldValue":" We investigate the issue of path selection in multihop wireless networks with the goal of identifying a scheme that can select a path with the largest expected duration. To this end, we first study the distribution of path duration. We show that, under a set of mild conditions, when the hop count along a path is large, the distribution of path duration can be well approximated by an exponential distribution even when the distributions of link durations are dependent and heterogeneous. Second, we investigate the statistical relation between a path duration and the durations of the links along the path. We prove that the parameter of the exponential distribution, which determines the expected duration of the path, is related to the link durations only through their means and is given by the sum of the inverses of the expected link durations. Based on our analytical results, we propose a scheme that can be implemented with existing routing protocols and select the paths with the largest expected durations. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using ns-2 simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9648","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9648","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9648","fieldValue":"ACM"}
