In this context querying formalisms are interesting that offer the possiblity to refer both to textual content and logical structure. We consider models where the strucutre specified in a query is not only used as a filter, but also for selecting and presenting different parts of the data. If answers are formalized as mapping from query nodes to the database, a simple enumeration of all mappings in the answer set will often suffer from the effect that many answers have common subparts. From a theoretical point of view this may lead to an exponential time complexity of the computation and presentation of all answers. Concentration on the language of so called tree queries‚\u20AC\u201Da variant and extension of Kilpel√§inen's Tree Matching formalism‚\u20AC\u201Dwe introduce the notion of a ‚\u20ACúcomplete answer aggregate‚\u20AC? for a given query. This new data strucutre offers a compact view of the set of all answer and supports active exploration of the ansewer space. Since complete answer aggregates use a powerful structure-sharing mechanism their maximal size is of order &sgr;(d‚\u20AC¢h‚\u20AC¢q) where d and q respectively denote the size of the database and the query, and h is the maximal depth of a path of the database. An algorithm is given that computes a complete answer aggregate for a given treee query in time &sgr;(d‚\u20AC¢log(d)‚\u20AC¢h‚\u20AC¢). For the sublanguage of so-called rigid tree queries, as well as for so-called ‚\u20ACúnonrecursive‚\u20AC? databases, an improved bound of :&sgr;(d‚\u20AC¢log(d)‚\u20AC¢q) is obtained. The algorithm is based on a specific index structure that supports practical efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23832","fieldValue":"SGML"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23832","fieldValue":"XML"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23832","fieldValue":"Complete answer aggregates for treelike databases: a novel approach to combine querying and navigation"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3314","fieldValue":" The present study examined the impact of augmented-reality visualization, in comparison to conventional ultrasound (CUS), on the learning of ultrasound-guided needle insertion. Whereas CUS requires cognitive processes for localizing targets, our augmented-reality device, called the ‚\u20ACúsonic flashlight‚\u20AC? (SF) enables direct perceptual guidance. Participants guided a needle to an ultrasound-localized target within opaque fluid. In three experiments, the SF showed higher accuracy and lower variability in aiming and endpoint placements than did CUS. The SF, but not CUS, readily transferred to new targets and starting points for action. These effects were evident in visually guided action (needle and target continuously visible) and visually directed action (target alone visible). The results have application to learning to visualize surgical targets through ultrasound."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3314","fieldValue":"Effectiveness of augmented-reality visualization versus cognitive mediation for learning actions in near space"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3314","fieldValue":"ACM"}
