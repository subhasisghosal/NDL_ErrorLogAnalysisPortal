It incorporates scaling of the problem parameters prior to the computation of eigenvalues, a choice of linearization with favorable conditioning and backward stability properties, and a preprocessing step that reveals and deflates the zero and infinite eigenvalues contributed by singular leading and trailing matrix coefficients. The algorithm is backward-stable for quadratics that are not too heavily damped. Numerical experiments show that our MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, quadeig, outperforms the MATLAB function polyeig in terms of both stability and efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/19351","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2450153.2450156\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19352","fieldValue":" This article proposes an efficient algorithm for reducing matrices to generalized Hessenberg form by unitary similarity, and recommends using it as a preprocessor in a variety of applications. To illustrate its usefulness, two cases from control theory are analyzed in detail: a solution procedure for a sequence of shifted linear systems with multiple right hand sides (e.g. evaluating the transfer function of a MIMO LTI dynamical system at many points) and computation of the staircase form. The proposed algorithm for the generalized Hessenberg reduction uses two levels of aggregation of Householder reflectors, thus allowing efficient BLAS 3-based computation. Another level of aggregation is introduced when solving many shifted systems by processing the shifts in batches. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed methods have superior efficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/19352","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2450153.2450157\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19352","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19352","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19353","fieldValue":" Tapenade is an Automatic Differentiation (AD) tool which, given a Fortran or C code that computes a function, creates a new code that computes its tangent or adjoint derivatives. Tapenade puts particular emphasis on adjoint differentiation, which computes gradients at a remarkably low cost. This article describes the principles of Tapenade, a subset of the general principles of AD. We motivate and illustrate with examples the AD model of Tapenade, that is, the structure of differentiated codes and the strategies used to make them more efficient. Along with this informal description, we formally specify this model by means of data-flow equations and rules of Operational Semantics, making this the reference specification of the tangent and adjoint modes of Tapenade. One benefit we expect from this formal specification is the capacity to formally study the AD model itself, especially for the adjoint mode and its sophisticated strategies. This article also describes the architectural choices of the implementation of Tapenade. We describe the current performance of Tapenade on a set of codes that include industrial-size applications. We present the extensions of the tool that are planned in a foreseeable future, deriving from our ongoing research on AD."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/19353","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2450153.2450158\"}"}
