Most of these approaches estimate the clean speech independently for each time-frequency point, neglecting the structure of the underlying speech sound. In this work, we derive a statistical estimator that explicitly takes into account information about the characteristic structure of voiced speech by means of a harmonic signal model. To this end, we also present a way to estimate a harmonic model-based clean speech representation and the corresponding error variance directly in the short-time Fourier transform domain. The resulting estimator is optimal in the minimum-mean-squared error sense and can conveniently be formulated in terms of a multichannel Wiener filter. The proposed estimator outperforms several reference algorithms in terms of speech quality and intelligibility as predicted by instrumental measures."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4033","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4034","fieldValue":"Van Dijk, Bas"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4034","fieldValue":" A general binaural noise reduction system is considered that employs the multichannel Wiener filter with partial noise estimation $(MWF_η) allowing for an explicit tradeoff between noise reduction and binaural noise cue preservation. In this paper, it is assumed that along with the general binaural system, a remote microphone signal with a high input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is available for inclusion in the MWFη$. The use of this remote microphone signal with a high input SNR allows for a simultaneous increase in both noise reduction performance and preservation of the binaural noise cues. To further increase the performance, a modification to the partial noise estimation (PNE) variable, η, is proposed which relies on exploiting the aforementioned trade-off by either constraining the output SNR or binaural noise cues to the same level before and after the addition of the remote microphone signal. The validity of the theoretical results are supplemented via simulations using a binaural setup with a single speech and noise source."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4034","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4034","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4034","fieldValue":"ACM"}
