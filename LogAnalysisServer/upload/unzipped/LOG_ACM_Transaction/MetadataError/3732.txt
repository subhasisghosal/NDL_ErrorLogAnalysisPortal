DWL supports optimization towards multiple heterogeneous policies and addresses the challenges arising from the heterogeneity of the agents that are charged with implementing them. DWL learns and exploits the dependencies between agents and between policies to improve overall system performance. Instead of always executing the locally-best action, agents learn how their actions affect their immediate neighbors and execute actions suggested by neighboring agents if their importance exceeds the local action's importance when scaled using a predefined or learned collaboration coefficient. We have evaluated DWL in a simulation of an Urban Traffic Control (UTC) system, a canonical example of the large-scale pervasive systems that we are addressing. We show that DWL outperforms widely deployed fixed-time and simple adaptive UTC controllers under a variety of traffic loads and patterns. Our results also confirm that enabling collaboration between agents is beneficial as is the ability for agents to learn the degree to which it is appropriate for them to collaborate. These results suggest that DWL is a suitable basis for optimization in other large-scale systems with similar characteristics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1229","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3103","fieldValue":" Parallel corpora are crucial for statistical machine translation (SMT); however, they are quite scarce for most language pairs and domains. As comparable corpora are far more available, many studies have been conducted to extract either parallel sentences or fragments from them for SMT. In this article, we propose an integrated system to extract both parallel sentences and fragments from comparable corpora. We first apply parallel sentence extraction to identify parallel sentences from comparable sentences. We then extract parallel fragments from the comparable sentences. Parallel sentence extraction is based on a parallel sentence candidate filter and classifier for parallel sentence identification. We improve it by proposing a novel filtering strategy and three novel feature sets for classification. Previous studies have found it difficult to accurately extract parallel fragments from comparable sentences. We propose an accurate parallel fragment extraction method that uses an alignment model to locate the parallel fragment candidates and an accurate lexicon-based filter to identify the truly parallel fragments. A case study on the Chinese--Japanese Wikipedia indicates that our proposed methods outperform previously proposed methods, and the parallel data extracted by our system significantly improves SMT performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3103","fieldValue":"Integrated Parallel Sentence and Fragment Extraction from Comparable Corpora: A Case Study on Chinese--Japanese Wikipedia"}
