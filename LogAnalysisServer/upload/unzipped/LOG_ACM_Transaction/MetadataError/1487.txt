{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15536","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present a system for cutting a moving object out from a video clip. The cutout object sequence can be pasted onto another video or a background image. To achieve this, we first apply a new 3D graph cut based segmentation approach on the spatial-temporal video volume. Our algorithm partitions watershed presegmentation regions into foreground and background while preserving temporal coherence. Then, the initial segmentation result is refined locally. Given two frames in the video sequence, we specify two respective windows of interest which are then tracked using a bi-directional feature tracking algorithm. For each frame in between these two given frames, the segmentation in each tracked window is refined using a 2D graph cut that utilizes a local color model. Moreover, we provide brush tools for the user to control the object boundary precisely wherever needed. Based on the accurate binary segmentation result, we apply coherent matting to extract the alpha mattes and foreground colors of the object."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15536","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15536","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15537","fieldValue":" This paper describes the construction of second generation bandelet bases and their application to 3D geometry compression. This new coding scheme is orthogonal and the corresponding basis functions are regular. In our method, surfaces are decomposed in a bandelet basis with a fast bandeletization algorithm that removes the geometric redundancy of orthogonal wavelet coefficients. The resulting transform coding scheme has an error decay that is asymptotically optimal for geometrically regular surfaces. We then use these bandelet bases to perform geometry image and normal map compression. Numerical tests show that for complex surfaces bandelets bring an improvement of 1.5dB to 2dB over state of the art compression schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15537","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15538","fieldValue":"Kuo, C-C Jay"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15538","fieldValue":" A new progressive lossless 3D triangular mesh encoder is proposed in this work, which can encode any 3D triangular mesh with an arbitrary topological structure. Given a mesh, the quantized 3D vertices are first partitioned into an octree (OT) structure, which is then traversed from the root and gradually to the leaves. During the traversal, each 3D cell in the tree front is subdivided into eight childcells. For each cell subdivision, both local geometry and connectivity changes are encoded, where the connectivity coding is guided by the geometry coding. Furthermore, prioritized cell subdivision is performed in the tree front to provide better rate-distortion (RD) performance. Experiments show that the proposed mesh coder outperforms the kd-tree algorithm in both geometry and connectivity coding efficiency. For the geometry coding part, the range of improvement is typically around 10%~20%, but may go up to 50%~60% for meshes with highly regular geometry data and\/or tight clustering of vertices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15538","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15538","fieldValue":"ACM"}
