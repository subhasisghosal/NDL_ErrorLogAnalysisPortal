A time-space trade-off for the exhaustive cracking of a cascade of ciphers is shown. The structure of the set of permutations realized by a cascade is studied; it is shown that only l.2k exhaustive experiments are necessary to determine the behavior of a cascade of l stages, each having k key bits. It is concluded that the cascade of random ciphers is not a random cipher. Yet, it is shown that, with high probability, the number of permutations realizable by a cascade of l random ciphers, each having k key bits, is 2lk. Next, it is shown that two stages are not worse than one, by a simple reduction of the cracking problem of any of the stages to the cracking problem of the cascade. Finally, it is shown that proving a nonpolynomial lower bound on the cracking problem of long cascades is a hard task, since such a bound implies that P &nap; NP."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12017","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12017","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12018","fieldValue":" Performance of a class of multistage interconnection networks employing redundant paths is investigated. Redundant path networks provide significant tolerance to faults at minimal costs; in this paper improvements in performance and very graceful degradation are also shown to result from the availability of redundant paths. A Markov model is introduced for the operation of these networks in the circuit-switched mode and is solved numerically to obtain the performance measures of interest. The structure of the networks that provide maximal performance is also characterized."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12018","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12019","fieldValue":" An algorithm is presented that uses only câˆšN messages to create mutual exclusion in a computernetwork, where N is the number of nodes and c a constant between 3 and 5.
