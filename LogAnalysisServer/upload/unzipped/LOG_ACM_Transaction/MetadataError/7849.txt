From the perspective of secondary users, spectrum availability is a time-varying network resource over which multihop end-to-end connections must be maintained. In this paper, a theoretical outlook on the problem of routing secondary user flows in a CRN is provided. The investigation aims to characterize optimal sequences of routes over which a secondary flow is maintained. The optimality is defined according to a novel metric that considers the maintenance cost of a route as channels, and\/or links must be switched due to the primary user activity. Different from the traditional notion of route stability, the proposed approach considers subsequent path selections, as well. The problem is formulated as an integer programming optimization model. Properties of the problem are also formally introduced and leveraged to design a heuristic algorithm when information on primary user activity is not complete. Numerical results are presented to assess the optimality gap of the heuristic routing algorithm in realistic CRN scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10511","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10511","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10512","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study the problem of computing quality fault-tolerant virtual backbone in homogeneous wireless network, which is defined as the k-connected m-dominating set problem in a unit disk graph. This problem is NP-hard, and thus many efforts have been made to find a constant factor approximation algorithm for it, but never sì³®ded so far with arbitrary k â\u2030¥ 3 and m â\u2030¥ 1 pair. We propose a new strategy for computing a smaller-size 3-connected m-dominating set in a unit disk graph with any m â\u2030¥ 1. We show the approximation ratio of our algorithm is constant and its running time is polynomial. We also conduct a simulation to examine the average performance of our algorithm. Our result implies that while there exists a constant factor approximation algorithm for the k-connected m-dominating set problem with arbitrary k â\u2030¤ 3 and m â\u2030¥ 1 pair, the k-connected m-dominating set problem is still open with k > 3."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10512","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10512","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10513","fieldValue":" The knowledge of end-to-end network distances is essential to many Internet applications. As active probing of all pairwise distances is infeasible in large-scale networks, a natural idea is to measure a few pairs and to predict the other ones without actually measuring them. This paper formulates the prediction problem as matrix completion where the unknown entries in a pairwise distance matrix constructed from a network are to be predicted. By assuming that the distance matrix has low-rank characteristics, the problem is solvable by low-rank approximation based on matrix factorization. The new formulation circumvents the well-known drawbacks of existing approaches based on Euclidean embedding. A new algorithm, so-called Decentralized Matrix Factorization by Stochastic Gradient Descent (DMFSGD), is proposed. By letting network nodes exchange messages with each other, the algorithm is fully decentralized and only requires each node to collect and to process local measurements, with neither explicit matrix constructions nor special nodes such as landmarks and central servers. In addition, we compared comprehensively matrix factorization and Euclidean embedding to demonstrate the suitability of the former on network distance prediction. We further studied the incorporation of a robust loss function and of nonnegativity constraints. Extensive experiments on various publicly available datasets of network delays show not only the scalability and the accuracy of our approach, but also its usability in real Internet applications."}
