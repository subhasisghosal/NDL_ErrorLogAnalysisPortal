{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6967","fieldValue":" Event logging is an important technique for networked embedded systems like wireless sensor networks. It can greatly help developers to understand complex system behaviors and diagnose program bugs. Existing logging facilities do not well satisfy three practical requirements: flexibility, efficiency, and high synchronization accuracy. To simultaneously satisfy these requirements, we present Dylog, a dynamic logging facility for networked embedded systems. Dylog employs several techniques. First, Dylog uses binary instrumentation for dynamically inserting or removing logging statements, enabling flexible and interactive debugging at runtime. Second, Dylog incorporates an efficient storage system and log collection protocol for recording and transferring the logging messages. Third, Dylog employs a lightweight data-driven approach for reconstructing the synchronized time of the logging messages. Dylog uses MAC-layer timestamping and drift compensation to achieve high synchronization accuracy. We implement Dylog on the TinyOS 2.1.1\/TelosB platform. Results show the following: (1) Dylog incurs a small overhead. Indirections in Dylog incur an additional execution overhead of less than 1&percnt;. Dylog reduces the logging storage size by approximately 50&percnt; compared with the standard TinyOS radio printf library. Dylog reduces the patch size by more than 90&percnt;, compared with incremental reprogramming. (2) Dylog reduces the synchronization overhead by 78&percnt; in terms of transmission cost, compared with a traditional time synchronization protocol, FTSP, and it can achieve a high time synchronization accuracy of 5.4Î¼s. (3) Dylog can help diagnose system problems effectively at the source-code level for three real-world scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6967","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6967","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6968","fieldValue":" With the advent of ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), the security and privacy issues for various smart devices such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and wireless sensor nodes are receiving increased attention from academia and industry. A number of lightweight cryptographic primitives have been proposed to provide security services for resource-constrained smart devices. As one of the core primitives, a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) plays an important role for lightweight embedded applications. The most existing PRNGs proposed for smart devices employ true random number generators as a component, which generally incur significant power consumption and gate count in hardware. In this article, we present Warbler family, a new pseudorandom number generator family based on nonlinear feedback shift registers (NLFSRs) with desirable randomness properties. The design of the Warbler family is based on the combination of modified de Bruijn blocks together with a nonlinear feedback Welch-Gong (WG) sequence generator, which enables us to precisely characterize the randomness properties and to flexibly adjust the security level of the resulting PRNG. Some criteria for selecting parameters of the Warbler family are proposed to offer the maximum level of security. Two instances of the Warbler family are also described, which feature two different security levels and are dedicated to EPC C1 Gen2 RFID tags and wireless sensor nodes, respectively. The security analysis shows that the proposed instances not only can pass the cryptographic statistical tests recommended by the EPC C1 Gen2 standard and NIST but also are resistant to the cryptanalytic attacks such as algebraic attacks, cube attacks, time-memory-data tradeoff attacks, MihaljeviÄ\u2021 et al.â\u20AC™s attacks, and weak internal state and fault injection attacks. Our ASIC implementations using a 65nm CMOS process demonstrate that the proposed two lightweight instances of the Warbler family can achieve good performance in terms of speed and area and provide ideal solutions for securing low-cost smart devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6968","fieldValue":"PRNG"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6968","fieldValue":"RFID"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6968","fieldValue":"Design and Implementation of Warbler Family of Lightweight Pseudorandom Number Generators for Smart Devices"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6968","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6968","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6969","fieldValue":" Present-day focus on multicore research has not only increased computing power but also power- and bandwidth-efficient communication among cores. On-chip communication networks have become popular today because of their low energy use and modular structure compared to bus-based interconnects. Silicon photonics has further boosted the performance of on-chip interconnection networks with its low energy-delay product and high reliability. In current multicore Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures, photonics is playing an important role in transferring large volumes of data both on- and off-chip. The problem addressed in this work is the issue of broadcast traffic arising due to invalidation requests from on-chip cache memories. Although such traffic is typically less than 1&percnt; of total traffic, it can easily present a high load on network resources, creating congestion and degrading performance. In this article, we propose a CDMA-based, secure, scalable, and energy-efficient technique to eliminate broadcast invalidations and increase overall performance. Experimental results indicate a performance boost up to 22.2&percnt; over a competing Photonic NoC and up to 57.4&percnt; over Electrical Mesh-based NoC when the proposed technique is used. Additional hardware deployed has an area overhead of less than 1&percnt;, whereas total energy consumed is at par with other state-of-the-art techniques."}
