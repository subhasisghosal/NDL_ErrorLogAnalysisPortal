First, we examine the implicit assumptions embodied in the method about the nature of organizations, work processes, and design. Following this we present the results of an exploratory study, conducted to find out how the method is applied in practice. This study reveals that while some of the tools of Structured Analysisâ\u20AC\u201Dnotably the data flow diagramsâ\u20AC\u201Dare used and combined with other tools, the designers do not follow the analysis and design procedures prescribed by the method. Our findings suggest that there is a gap between the way systems development is portrayed in the normative technical literature and the way in which it is carried out."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23706","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23706","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3301","fieldValue":" This paper presents results that demonstrate functional similarities in subjects' access to spatial knowledge (or spatial representation) between real and virtual environments. Such representations are important components of the transfer of reasoning ability and knowledge between these two environments. In particular, we present two experiments aimed at investigating similarities in spatial knowledge derived from exploring on foot both physical environments and virtual environments presented through a head-mounted display. In the first experiment, subjects were asked to learn the locations of target objects in the real or virtual environment and then rotate the perspective by either physically locomoting to a new facing direction or imagining moving. The latencies and errors were generally worse after imagining locomoting and for greater degrees of rotation in perspective; they did not differ significantly across knowledge derived from exploring the physical versus virtual environments. In the second experiment, subjects were asked to imagine simple rotations versus simple translations in perspective. The errors and latencies indicated that the to-be-imagined disparity was linearly related after learning the physical and virtual environment. These results demonstrate functional similarities in access to knowledge of new perspective when it is learned by exploring physical environments and virtual renderings of the same environment."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23707","fieldValue":" Hypertext development should benefit from a systematic, structured development, especially in the case of large and complex applications. A structured approach to hypertext development suggests the notion of authoring-in-the-large. Authoring-in-the-large allows the description of overall classes of information elements and navigational structures of complex applications without much concern with implementation details, and in a system-independent manner. The paper presents HDM (Hypertext Design Model), a first step towards defining a general purpose model for authoring-in-the-large. Some of the most innovative features of HDM are: the notion of perspective; the identification of different categories of links (structural links, application links, and perspective links) with different representational roles; the distinction between hyperbase and access structures; and the possibility of easily integrating the structure of a hypertext application with its browsing semantics. HDM can be used in different manners: as a modeling device or as an implementation device. As a modeling device, it supports producing high level specifications of existing or to-be-developed applications. As an implementation device, it is the basis for designing tools that directly support application development. One of the central advantages of HDM in the design and practical construction of hypertext applications is that the definition of a significant number of links can be derived automatically from a conceptual-design level description. Examples of usage of HDM are also included."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23707","fieldValue":"HDM"}
