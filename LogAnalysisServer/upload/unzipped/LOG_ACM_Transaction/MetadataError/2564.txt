Such calculations are important in the representation theory of G, and have previously been difficult to carry out for large Weyl groups such as E8. This new technique allows large orbits to be computed using only a small fraction of the computer memory required when using standard techniques. In the case of E8, the memory requirements can be reduced by a factor of 30,000."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18641","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18641","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18642","fieldValue":"ACM"}
