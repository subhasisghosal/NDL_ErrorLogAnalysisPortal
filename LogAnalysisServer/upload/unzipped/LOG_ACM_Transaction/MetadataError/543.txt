{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12766","fieldValue":" In this paper we study structural gate decomposition in general, simple gate networks for depth-optimal technology mapping using K-input Lookup-Tables (K-LUTs). We show that (1) structural gate decomposition in any K-bounded network results in an optimal mapping depth smaller than or equal to that of the original network, regardless of the decomposition method used; and (2) the problem of structural gate decomposition for depth-optimal technology mapping is NP-hard for K-unbounded networks when Kâ\u2030¥3 and remains NP-hard for K-boundeds networks when Kâ\u2030¥5. Based on these results, we propose two new structural gate decomposition algorithms, named DOGMA and DOGMA-m, which combine the level-driven node-packing technique (used in FlowMap) and the network flow-based labeling technique (used in Chortle-d) for depth-optimal technology mapping. Experimental results show that (1) among five structural gate decompostion algorithms, DOGMA-m results in the best mapping solutions; and (2) compared with speed_up(an algebraic algorithm) and TOS (a Boolean approach), DOGMA-m completes, decomposition of all tested benchmarks in a short time while speed_up and TOS fail in several cases. However, speed_up results in the smallest depth and area in the following technology mapping steps."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12766","fieldValue":"FPGA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1149","fieldValue":" This work presents approaches for designing the input-output device management components of self-stabilizing operating systems. As an example, we demonstrate the nonstability of the ata standard protocol for storage devices. We state the requirements that an operating system and I\/O devices should satisfy in order to become self-stabilizing. Then we suggest two solutions to satisfy these requirements. The first uses leases to guarantee progress from the I\/O device side. The second assumes stabilization of the I\/O device, and uses snapshots to perform consistency checks. A device driver for a PC hard-disk, using the first solution, was implemented. By supplying an infrastructure for practical self-stabilizing systems, robust and dependable systems can be achieved."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1149","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1149","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2214","fieldValue":" This work addresses k-restriction problems, which unify combinatorial problems of the following type: The goal is to construct a short list of strings in $Î£^m$ that satisfies a given set of k-wise demands. For every k positions and every demand, there must be at least one string in the list that satisfies the demand at these positions. Problems of this form frequently arise in different fields in Computer Science.The standard approach for deterministically solving such problems is via almost k-wise independence or k-wise approximations for other distributions. We offer a generic algorithmic method that yields considerably smaller constructions. To this end, we generalize a previous work of Naor et al. [1995]. Among other results, we enhance the combinatorial objects in the heart of their method, called splitters, and construct multi-way splitters, using a new discrete version of the topological Necklace Splitting Theorem [Alon 1987].We utilize our methods to show improved constructions for group testing [Ngo and Du 2000] and generalized hashing [Alon et al. 2003], and an improved inapproximability result for SET-COVER under the assumption P &neq; NP."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2214","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-restriction"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2214","fieldValue":"<i>k<\/i>-restriction"}
