We present several practical algorithms for computing such geodesics from a source point to one or all other points efficiently. First, we describe an implementation of the exact \"single source, all destination\" algorithm presented by Mitchell, Mount, and Papadimitriou (MMP). We show that the algorithm runs much faster in practice than suggested by worst case analysis. Next, we extend the algorithm with a merging operation to obtain computationally efficient and accurate approximations with bounded error. Finally, to compute the shortest path between two given points, we use a lower-bound property of our approximate geodesic algorithm to efficiently prune the frontier of the MMP algorithm. thereby obtaining an exact solution even more quickly."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15531","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15531","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15532","fieldValue":" Constructing a function that interpolates a set of values defined at vertices of a mesh is a fundamental operation in computer graphics. Such an interpolant has many uses in applications such as shading, parameterization and deformation. For closed polygons, mean value coordinates have been proven to be an excellent method for constructing such an interpolant. In this paper, we generalize mean value coordinates from closed 2D polygons to closed triangular meshes. Given such a mesh P, we show that these coordinates are continuous everywhere and smooth on the interior of P. The coordinates are linear on the triangles of P and can reproduce linear functions on the interior of P. To illustrate their usefulness, we conclude by considering several interesting applications including constructing volumetric textures and surface deformation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15533","fieldValue":"McGuire, Morgan"}
