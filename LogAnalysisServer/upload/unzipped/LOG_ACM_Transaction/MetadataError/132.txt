In particular, these applications include multimedia facilities where real time constraints are crucial to their correct functioning. In order to specify such systems it is necessary to describe that events occur at times given by probability distributions; stochastic automata have emerged as a useful technique by which such systems can be specified and verified.However, stochastic descriptions are very general, in particular they allow the use of general probability distribution functions, and therefore their verification can be complex. In the last few years, model checking has emerged as a useful verification tool for large systems. In this article we describe two model checking algorithms for stochastic automata. These algorithms consider how properties written in a simple probabilistic real-time logic can be checked against a given stochastic automaton."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11402","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11402","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2038","fieldValue":"J, Soumya"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2038","fieldValue":" The addition of express channels to a traditional mesh network-on-chip (NoC) has emerged as a viable solution to solve the problem of high latency. In this article, we address the problem of integrated mapping and synthesis for express channel--based mesh NoC topologies. An integer linear programming--based formulation has been presented for the mapping problem followed by a constructive heuristic for simultaneous application mapping and synthesis for an express channel--based NoC. The static and dynamic simulation results indicate that the obtained mappings lead to significant reduction in both average packet delay and network energy consumption. The obtained synthesized topologies were also found to be much more power efficient compared to conventional express channel topologies."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2038","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2038","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11403","fieldValue":" We address the problem of complementing higher-order patterns without repetitions of existential variables. Differently from the first-order case, the complement of a pattern cannot, in general, be described by a pattern, or even by a finite set of patterns. We therefore generalize the simply-typed Î»-calculus to include an internal notion of strict function so that we can directly express that a term must depend on a given variable. We show that, in this more expressive calculus, finite sets of patterns without repeated variables are closed under complement and intersection. Our principal application is the transformational approach to negation in higher-order logic programs."}
