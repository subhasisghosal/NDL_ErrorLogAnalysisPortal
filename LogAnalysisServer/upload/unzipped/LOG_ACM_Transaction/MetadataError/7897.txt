While these systems have good accuracy under benign settings, they suffer a severe decrease of their effectiveness when under attack by compromised nodes acting as insider attackers. Previous defenses mitigate such attacks by using machine learning techniques to differentiate good behavior (learned over time) from bad behavior. However, these defense schemes have been shown to be vulnerable to advanced attacks that make the schemes learn malicious behavior as good behavior. We present Newton, a decentralized VCS that is robust to a wide class of insider attacks. Newton uses an abstraction of a real-life physical system, similar to that of Vivaldi, but in addition uses safety invariants derived from Newton's laws of motion. As a result, Newton does not need to learn good behavior and can tolerate a significantly higher percentage of malicious nodes. We show through simulations and real-world experiments on the PlanetLab testbed that Newton is able to mitigate all known attacks against VCSs while providing better accuracy than Vivaldi, even in benign settings. Finally, we show how to design a VCS that bettermatches a real physical system, thus allowing for more intuitive and tighter system parameters that are even more difficult to exploit by attackers."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10608","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10608","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10609","fieldValue":" In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic performance limits (throughput capacity and average packet delay) of social-proximity vehicular networks. The considered network involves N vehicles moving and communicating on a scalable grid-like street layout following the social-proximity model: Each vehicle has a restricted mobility region around a specific social spot and transmits via a unicast flow to a destination vehicle that is associated with the same social spot. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the vehicle decays following a power-law distribution from the central social spot toward the border of the mobility region. With vehicles communicating using a variant of the two-hop relay scheme, the asymptotic bounds of throughput capacity and average packet delay are derived in terms of the number of social spots, the size of the mobility region, and the decay factor of the power-law distribution. By identifying these key impact factors of performance mathematically, we find three possible regimes for the performance limits. Our results can be applied to predict the network performance of real-world scenarios and provide insight on the design and deployment of future vehicular networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10609","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10609","fieldValue":"ACM"}
