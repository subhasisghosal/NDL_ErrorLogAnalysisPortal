We propose to address this problem using a divide and conquer approach: the network is divided into convex pieces by a distributed convex partitioning protocol, using connectivity information only. A convex network partition exhibits some desirable properties that allow traditional algorithms to work to their full advantage. Based on this, we can achieve relatively high performance for an algorithm by combining algorithmic actions within individual partitions. We consider two important applications: virtual-coordinate-based geographic routing and connectivity-based localization. The former benefits from convex partition's friendliness to network embedding, which is crucial to generating accurate virtual coordinates for the nodes, while the latter leverages the fact that shortest paths are largely straight for node pairs within a convex partition. Experimental results show that the convex partition approach can significantly improve the performance of both applications in comparison with state-of-the-art solutions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21492","fieldValue":"Carreira-Perpin, Miguel "}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21492","fieldValue":"Carreira-Perpin, Miguel "}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21492","fieldValue":"Cerpa, Alberto E"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21492","fieldValue":" Heating, cooling and ventilation accounts for 35&percnt; energy usage in the United States. Currently, most modern buildings still condition rooms assuming maximum occupancy rather than actual usage. As a result, rooms are often over-conditioned needlessly. Thus, in order to achieve efficient conditioning, we require knowledge of occupancy. This article shows how real time occupancy data from a wireless sensor network can be used to create occupancy models, which in turn can be integrated into building conditioning system for usage-based demand control conditioning strategies. Using strategies based on sensor network occupancy model predictions, we show that it is possible to achieve 42&percnt; annual energy savings while still maintaining American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) comfort standards."}
