Shape complementarity is achieved by matching local surface patches. However, unlike existing approaches, which are based on single-patch or two-patch matching, we developed a new algorithm that compares simultaneously, groups of neighboring patches from the receptor with groups of neighboring patches from the ligand. Taking into account the fact that shape complementarity in protein surfaces is mostly approximate rather than exact, the proposed group-based matching algorithm fits perfectly to the nature of protein surfaces. This is demonstrated by the high performance that our method achieves especially in the case where the unbound structures of the proteins are considered. Additionally, several physicochemical factors, such as desolvation energy, electrostatic complementarity (EC), hydrophobicity (HP), Coulomb potential (CP), and Lennard-Jones potential are integrated using an optimized scoring function, improving geometric ranking in more than 60 percent of the complexes of Docking Benchmark 2.4."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4882","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4882","fieldValue":"Proteins,Shape,Bioinformatics,Computational biology,Electric potential,Iterative closest point algorithm,Electrostatics,physicochemical complementarity,Protein docking,local descriptors,shape complementarity"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4882","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4882","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4883","fieldValue":" Supertrees are a commonly used tool in phylogenetics to summarize collections of partial phylogenetic trees. As a generalization of supertrees, phylogenetic supernetworks allow, in addition, the visual representation of conflict between the trees that is not possible to observe with a single tree. Here, we introduce SuperQ, a new method for constructing such supernetworks (SuperQ is freely available at >www.uea.ac.uk\/computing\/superq.). It works by first breaking the input trees into quartet trees, and then stitching these together to form a special kind of phylogenetic network, called a split network. This stitching process is performed using an adaptation of the QNet method for split network reconstruction employing a novel approach to use the branch lengths from the input trees to estimate the branch lengths in the resulting network. Compared with previous supernetwork methods, SuperQ has the advantage of producing a planar network. We compare the performance of SuperQ to the Z-closure and Q-imputation supernetwork methods, and also present an analysis of some published data sets as an illustration of its applicability."}
