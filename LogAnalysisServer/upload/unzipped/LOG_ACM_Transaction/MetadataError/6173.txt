{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6470","fieldValue":" Staff shortages and an increasingly aging population are straining the ability of emergency departments to provide high quality care. At the same time, there is a growing concern about hospitals' ability to provide effective care during disaster events. For these reasons, tools that automate patient monitoring have the potential to greatly improve efficiency and quality of health care. Towards this goal, we have developed MEDiSN, a wireless sensor network for monitoring patients' physiological data in hospitals and during disaster events. MEDiSN comprises Physiological Monitors (PMs), which are custom-built, patient-worn motes that sample, encrypt, and sign physiological data and Relay Points (RPs) that self-organize into a multi-hop wireless backbone for carrying physiological data. Moreover, MEDiSN includes a back-end server that persistently stores medical data and presents them to authenticated GUI clients. The combination of MEDiSN's two-tier architecture and optimized rate control protocols allows it to address the compound challenge of reliably delivering large volumes of data while meeting the application's QoS requirements. Results from extensive simulations, testbed experiments, and multiple pilot hospital deployments show that MEDiSN can scale from tens to at least five hundred PMs, effectively protect application packets from congestive and corruptive losses, and deliver medically actionable data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6470","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6470","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6471","fieldValue":"Pietro, Giuseppe DE"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6471","fieldValue":" Wireless and pervasive healthcare applications typically present critical requirements from the point of view of functional correctness, reliability, availability, security, and safety. In contrast to the case of classic safety critical applications, the behavior of wireless and pervasive applications is affected by the movements and location of users and resources. This article presents a methodology to formally express requirements in safety critical wireless and pervasive healthcare applications in order to achieve a higher degree of dependability. In particular, it will be shown how it is possible to formalize and constrict mobility characteristics by combining, and in some cases extending, several formal methods. The article also describes a rigorous specification process. Finally, it concludes with a case study of a real safety critical pervasive healthcare application that is going to be deployed in a city hospital."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6471","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6471","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6472","fieldValue":"Yeoh, Wee-Soon"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6472","fieldValue":" This article introduces MobiSense, a novel mobile health monitoring system for ambulatory patients. MobiSense resides in a mobile device, communicates with a set of body sensor devices attached to the wearer, and processes data from these sensors. MobiSense is able to detect body postures such as lying, sitting, and standing, and walking speed, by utilizing our rule-based heuristic activity classification scheme based on the extended Kalman (EK) Filtering algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed system is capable of controlling each of the sensor devices, and performing resource reconfiguration and management schemes (sensor sleep\/wake-up mode). The architecture of MobiSense is highlighted and discussed in depth. The system has been implemented, and its prototype is showcased. We have also carried out rigorous performance measurements of the system including real-time and query latency as well as the power consumption of the sensor nodes. The accuracy of our activity classifier scheme has been evaluated by involving several human subjects, and we found promising results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6472","fieldValue":"ACM"}
