The scalability of these properties has been a primary concern for which asymptotic analysis is a useful tool. Three related but logically distinct network models are often considered in asymptotic analyses, viz. the dense network model, the extended network model, and the infinite network model, which consider respectively a network deployed in a fixed finite area with a sufficiently large node density, a network deployed in a sufficiently large area with a fixed node density, and a network deployed in $R^2$ with a sufficiently large node density. The infinite network model originated from continuum percolation theory and asymptotic results obtained from the infinite network model have often been applied to the dense and extended networks. In this paper, through two case studies related to network connectivity on the expected number of isolated nodes and on the vanishing of components of finite order k > 1 respectively, we demonstrate some subtle but important differences between the infinite network model and the dense and extended network models. Therefore, extra scrutiny has to be used in order for the results obtained from the infinite network model to be applicable to the dense and extended network models. Asymptotic results are also obtained on the expected number of isolated nodes, the vanishingly small impact of the boundary effect on the number of isolated nodes, and the vanishing of components of finite order k > 1 in the dense and extended network models using a generic random connection model."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10284","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10284","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1935","fieldValue":" Research has shown that operating in the near-threshold region is expected to provide up to 10Ã\u2014 energy efficiency for future processors. However, reliable operation below a minimum voltage (Vccmin) cannot be guaranteed due to process variations. Because SRAM margins can easily be violated at near-threshold voltages, their bit-cell failure rates are expected to rise steeply. Multicore processors rely on fast private L1 caches to exploit data locality and achieve high performance. In the presence of high bit-cell fault rates, traditionally an L1 cache either sacrifices capacity or incurs additional latency to correct the faults. We observe that L1 cache sensitivity to hit latency offers a design trade-off between capacity and latency. When fault rate is high at extreme Vccmin, it is beneficial to recover L1 cache capacity, even if it comes at the cost of additional latency. However, at low fault rates, the additional constant latency to recover cache capacity degrades performance. With this trade-off in mind, we propose a Non-Uniform Cache Access L1 architecture (NUCA-L1) that avoids additional latency on accesses to fault-free cache lines. To mitigate the capacity bottleneck, it deploys a correction mechanism to recover capacity at the cost of additional latency. Using extensive simulations of a 64-core multicore, we demonstrate that at various bit-cell fault rates, our proposed private NUCA-L1 cache architecture performs better than state-of-the-art schemes, along with a significant reduction in energy consumption."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1935","fieldValue":"NTV"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1935","fieldValue":"NUCA-L1: A Non-Uniform Access Latency Level-1 Cache Architecture for Multicores Operating at Near-Threshold Voltages"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1935","fieldValue":"ACM"}
