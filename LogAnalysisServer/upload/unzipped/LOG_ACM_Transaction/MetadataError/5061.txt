The challenge for language designers is to devise appropriate abstractions and linguistic primitives to deal with the large dimension of systems and with their need to adapt to the changes of the working environment and to the evolving requirements. We propose a set of programming abstractions that permit us to represent behaviors, knowledge, and aggregations according to specific policies and to support programming context-awareness, self-awareness, and adaptation. Based on these abstractions, we define SCEL (Software Component Ensemble Language), a kernel language whose solid semantic foundations lay also the basis for formal reasoning on autonomic systems behavior. To show expressiveness and effectiveness of SCEL;â\u20AC™s design, we present a Java implementation of the proposed abstractions and show how it can be exploited for programming a robotics scenario that is used as a running example for describing the features and potential of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1290","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3816","fieldValue":"Van hamme, Hugo"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3816","fieldValue":" Exemplar-based speech enhancement systems work by decomposing the noisy speech as a weighted sum of speech and noise exemplars stored in a dictionary and use the resulting speech and noise estimates to obtain a time-varying filter in the full-resolution frequency domain to enhance the noisy speech. To obtain the decomposition, exemplars sampled in lower dimensional spaces are preferred over the full-resolution frequency domain for their reduced computational complexity and the ability to better generalize to unseen cases. But the resulting filter may be sub-optimal as the mapping of the obtained speech and noise estimates to the full-resolution frequency domain yields a low-rank approximation. This paper proposes an efficient way to directly compute the full-resolution frequency estimates of speech and noise using coupled dictionaries: an input dictionary containing atoms from the desired exemplar space to obtain the decomposition and a coupled output dictionary containing exemplars from the full-resolution frequency domain. We also introduce modulation spectrogram features for the exemplar-based tasks using this approach. The proposed system was evaluated for various choices of input exemplars and yielded improved speech enhancement performances on the AURORA-2 and AURORA-4 databases. We further show that the proposed approach also results in improved word error rates (WERs) for the speech recognition tasks using HMM-GMM and deep-neural network (DNN) based systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3816","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3816","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3817","fieldValue":"Zhu, Wei-Ping"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3817","fieldValue":" This paper presents a speech enhancement approach, where an adaptive threshold is statistically determined based on Student t Modeling of Teager energy (TE) operated perceptual wavelet packet (PWP) coefficients of noisy speech. In order to obtain an enhanced speech, the threshold thus derived is applied upon the PWP coefficients by employing a Student t pdf dependent custom thresholding function, which is designed based on a combination of modified hard and semisoft thresholding functions. Extensive simulations are carried out using the NOIZEUS database to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for car and multi-talker babble noise corrupted speech signals. Several standard objective measures and subjective evaluations including formal listening tests show that the proposed method outperforms some of the state-of-the-art speech enhancement methods at high as well as low levels of SNRs."}
