{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3623","fieldValue":" Most chord recognition systems share a common architecture comprising two main stages: feature extraction and pattern matching, and two optional sub stages: pre-filtering and post-filtering. Understanding the interaction between these basic components is very important not only for achieving optimal performance, but also for assessing the potential and limitations of the system. Unfortunately, there are no studies that sufficiently evaluate the effects of the different approaches to each processing step and the interactions between these steps. In this paper we attempt to remedy this deficiency by performing a systematic evaluation encompassing a wide variety of techniques used for each processing step. In our study we find that filtering has a significant impact on performance, but providing musical context information in the transition matrix is rendered moot by the need to enforce continuity in the estimations. We discovered that the benefits of using complex chord models can be largely offset by an appropriate choice of features. In addition, the initial performance gap between different features were not fully compensated by any subsequent processing stages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3623","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3623","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3624","fieldValue":" Sound source localization and separation from a mixture of sounds are essential functions for computational auditory scene analysis. The main challenges are designing a unified framework for joint optimization and estimating the sound sources under auditory uncertainties such as reverberation or unknown number of sounds. Since sound source localization and separation are mutually dependent, their simultaneous estimation is required for better and more robust performance. A unified model is presented for sound source localization and separation based on Bayesian nonparametrics. Experiments using simulated and recorded audio mixtures show that a method based on this model achieves state-of-the-art sound source separation quality and has more robust performance on the source number estimation under reverberant environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3624","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3624","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3625","fieldValue":"Jianjun He"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3625","fieldValue":"Ee-Leng Tan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3625","fieldValue":"Woon-Seng Gan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3625","fieldValue":" Audio signals for moving pictures and video games are often linear combinations of primary and ambient components. In spatial audio analysis-synthesis, these mixed signals are usually decomposed into primary and ambient components to facilitate flexible spatial rendering and enhancement. Existing approaches such as principal component analysis (PCA) and least squares (LS) are widely used to perform this decomposition from stereo signals. However, the performance of these approaches in primary-ambient extraction (PAE) has not been well studied and no comparative analysis among the existing approaches has been carried out so far. In this paper, we generalize the existing approaches into a linear estimation framework. Under this framework, we propose a series of performance measures to identify the components that contribute to the extraction error. Based on the generalized linear estimation framework and our proposed performance measures, a comparative study and experimental testing of the linear estimation based PAE approaches including existing PCA, LS, and three proposed variant LS approaches are presented."}
