This has motivated recent research effort into methods for parameter inference and experiment design for such models. The major difficulty is that such methods usually require one to iteratively solve the chemical master equation that governs the time evolution of the probability distribution of the system. This, however, is rarely possible, and even approximation techniques remain limited to relatively small and simple systems. An alternative explored in this article is to base methods on only some low-order moments of the entire probability distribution. We summarize the theory behind such moment-based methods for parameter inference and experiment design and provide new case studies where we investigate their performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25118","fieldValue":"Moment-Based Methods for Parameter Inference and Experiment Design for Stochastic Biochemical Reaction Networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25118","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25118","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25119","fieldValue":" The computation of transient probabilities for continuous-time Markov chains often employs uniformization, also known as the Jensen method. The fast adaptive uniformization method introduced by Mateescu et al. approximates the probability by neglecting insignificant states and has proven to be effective for quantitative analysis of stochastic models arising in chemical and biological applications. However, this method has only been formulated for the analysis of properties at a given point of time t. In this article, we extend fast adaptive uniformization to handle expected reward properties that reason about the model behavior until time t, for example, the expected number of chemical reactions that have occurred until t. To show the feasibility of the approach, we integrate the method into the probabilistic model checker PRISM and apply it to a range of biological models. The performance of the method is enhanced by the use of interval splitting. We compare our implementation to standard uniformization implemented in PRISM and to fast adaptive uniformization without support for cumulative rewards implemented in MARCIE, demonstrating superior performance."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25119","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25119","fieldValue":"ACM"}
