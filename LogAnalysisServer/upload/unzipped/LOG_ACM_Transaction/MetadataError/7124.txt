{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9073","fieldValue":" The proportional differentiation model provides the network operator with the 'tuning knobs' for adjusting the per-hop quality-of-service (QoS) ratios between classes, independent of the class loads. This paper applies the proportional model in the differentiation of queueing delays, and investigates appropriate packet scheduling mechanisms. Starting from the proportional delay differentiation (PDD) model, we derive the average queueing delay in each class, show the dynamics of the class delays under the PDD constraints, and state the conditions in which the PDD model is feasible. The feasibility model of the model can be determined from the average delays that result with the strict priorities scheduler. We then focus on scheduling mechanisms that can implement the PDD model, when it is feasible to do so. The proportional average delay (PAD) scheduler meets the PDD constraints, when they are feasible, but it exhibits a pathological behavior in short timescales. The waiting time priority (WTP) scheduler, on the other hand, approximates the PDD model closely, even in the short timescales of a few packet departures, but only in heavy load conditions. PAD and WTP serve as motivation for the third scheduler, called hybrid proportional delay (HPD). HPD approximates the PDD model closely, when the model is feasible, independent of the class load distribution. Also, HPD provides predictable delay differentiation even in short timescales."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9073","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9073","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9073","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9074","fieldValue":" Continuous-media traffic (i.e., audio and video) can tolerate some loss but has rigid delay constraints. A natural QoS requirement for a continuous-media connection is a prescribed limit on the fraction of traffic that exceeds an end-to-end delay constraint. We propose and analyze a framework that provides such a statistical QoS guarantee to traffic in a packet-switched network. Providing statistical guarantees in a network is a notoriously difficult problem because traffic flows lose their original statistical characterizations at the outputs of queues. Our scheme uses bufferless statistical multiplexing combined with cascaded leaky buckets for smoothing and traffic contracting. This scheme along with a novel method for bounding the loss probability gives a tractable framework for providing end-to-end statistical QoS. Using MPEG video traces, we present numerical results that compare the connection-carrying capacity of our scheme with that of guaranteed service schemes (i.e., no loss) using GPS and RCS. Our numerical work indicates that our scheme can support significantly more connections without introducing significant traffic loss."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9074","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9074","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9074","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9075","fieldValue":" We investigate how quality of service may be guaranteed to a flow of packets in the presence of flow aggregation. For efficiency, multiple flows, known as the constituent flows, are merged together resulting in a single aggregate flow. After the network node where the aggregation occurs, packet schedulers are aware of the aggregate flow, but are unaware of its constituent flows. In spite of this, we show that quality of service may be guaranteed to the constituent flows, provided the aggregation is performed fairly. When the delay bound of a flow is de-coupled from the flow's reserved rate, flow aggregation preserves the delay bound. When the delay bound of a flow is coupled to the flow's reserved rate, flow aggregation preserves, and in some cases improves, the delay bound."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9075","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
