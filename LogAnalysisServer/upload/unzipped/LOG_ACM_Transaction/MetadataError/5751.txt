This algorithm is a model tree-based method to detect the relationship between each gene and the remaining genes simultaneously instead of analyzing individually each pair of genes as correlation-based methods do. Model trees are a very useful technique to estimate the gene expression value by regression models and favours localized similarities over more global similarity, which is one of the major drawbacks of correlation-based methods. Here, we present an integrated software suite, named RegNetC, as a Cytoscape plugin that can operate on its own as well. RegNetC facilitates, according to user-defined parameters, the resulted transcriptional gene association network in .sif format for visualization, analysis and interoperates with other Cytoscape plugins, which can be exported for publication figures. In addition to the network, the RegNetC plugin also provides the quantitative relationships between genes expression values of those genes involved in the inferred network, i.e., those defined by the regression models."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5213","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
