Using a dual logical\/physical perspective, we identify four principal components that characterize any spread sheet model: schema, data, editorial, and binding. We present a factoring algorithm for identifying and extracting these components from conventional spreadsheets with minimal user intervention, and a synthesis algorithm that assists users in the construction of executable spreadsheets from reusable model components. This approach opens new possibilities for applying object-oriented and model management techniques to support the construction, sharing, and reuse of spreadsheet models in organizations. Importantly, our approach to model management and the Windows-based prototype that we have developed are designed to coexist with, rather than replace, traditional spreadsheet programs. In other words, the users are not required to learn a new modeling language; instead, their logical models and data sets are extracted from their spreadsheets transparently, as a side-effect of using standard spreadsheet programs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23736","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23737","fieldValue":"Wong, S.

The fundamental notions of term weights and relevance are given probabilistic interpretations. A unified framework is developed for modeling the retrieval process with probabilistic inference. This new approach provides a common conceptual and mathematical basis for many retrieval models, such as the Boolean, fuzzy set, vector space, and conventional probabilistic models. Within this framework, the underlying assumptions employed by each model are identified, and the inherent relationships between these models are analyzed. Although this article is mainly a theoretical analysis of probabilistic inference for information retrieval, practical methods for estimating the required probabilities are provided by simple examples."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23737","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23738","fieldValue":"Tague-Sutcliffe, Jean"}
