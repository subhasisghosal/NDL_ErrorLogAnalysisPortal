A tradeoff between the performance and the convergence rate is a well-known problem due to the choice of the step size. Although the variable-step-size FxLMS algorithms have been proposed for fast convergence, a long tap-length filter is frequently required in order to deal with different environments such that the convergence rate is still subject to a small step size for the long tap length. In this paper, we study a new ANC system with a variable tap-length and step-size FxLMS algorithm. Based on the assumption of an unsymmetric and two-sided exponential decay response model for the ANC control filter, the new FxLMS algorithm has the minimum mean-square deviation for the optimal filter coefficients. In the online secondary path modeling ANC system, simulation results show that the new algorithm with different kind of variable step sizes can provide significant improvements of convergence rate and noise reduction ratio, compared to the fixed-tap-length FxLMS algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3628","fieldValue":"Feedforward Active Noise Control With a New Variable Tap-Length and Step-Size Filtered-X LMS Algorithm"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3628","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3628","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3629","fieldValue":"McVicar, Matt"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3629","fieldValue":"Santos-Rodriguez, Raul"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3629","fieldValue":"Yizhao Ni"}
