Among many existing techniques, those based on geodesic distance have proven effective in providing intrinsic and discriminative shape descriptors. In this article we introduce a new intrinsic function for a three-dimensional (3D) shape and use it for shape description and geometric feature detection. Specifically, we introduce the intrinsic girth function (IGF) defined on a 2D closed surface. For a point p on the surface, the value of the IGF at p is the length of the shortest nonzero geodesic path starting and ending at p. The IGF is invariant under isometry, insensitive to mesh tessellations, and robust to surface noise. We propose a fast method for computing the IGF and discuss its applications to shape retrieval and detecting tips, tubes, and plates that are constituent parts of 3D objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17641","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17641","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2668","fieldValue":" Dual-pivot quicksort refers to variants of classical quicksort where in the partitioning step two pivots are used to split the input into three segments. This can be done in different ways, giving rise to different algorithms. Recently, a dual-pivot algorithm due to Yaroslavskiy received much attention, because it replaced the well-engineered quicksort algorithm in Oracleâ\u20AC™s Java 7 runtime library. Nebel and Wild (ESA 2012) analyzed this algorithm and showed that on average it uses 1.9nln n + O(n) comparisons to sort an input of size n, beating standard quicksort, which uses 2nln n + O(n) comparisons. We introduce a model that captures all dual-pivot algorithms, give a unified analysis, and identify new dual-pivot algorithms that minimize the average number of key comparisons among all possible algorithms up to a linear term. This minimum is 1.8nln n + O(n). For the case that the pivots are chosen from a small sample, we include a comparison of dual-pivot quicksort and classical quicksort. Specifically, we show that dual-pivot quicksort benefits from a skewed choice of pivots. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms and compare them to Yaroslavskiyâ\u20AC™s algorithm and the recently described 3-pivot quicksort algorithm of Kushagra et al. (ALENEX 2014)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2668","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17642","fieldValue":"Haines, Tom S F"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17642","fieldValue":"Mac Aodha, Oisin"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17642","fieldValue":" There are many scenarios where we wish to imitate a specific authorâ\u20AC™s pen-on-paper handwriting style. Rendering new text in someoneâ\u20AC™s handwriting is difficult because natural handwriting is highly variable, yet follows both intentional and involuntary structure that makes a personâ\u20AC™s style self-consistent. The variability means that naive example-based texture synthesis can be conspicuously repetitive. We propose an algorithm that renders a desired input string in an authorâ\u20AC™s handwriting. An annotated sample of the authorâ\u20AC™s handwriting is required; the system is flexible enough that historical documents can usually be used with only a little extra effort. Experiments show that our glyph-centric approach, with learned parameters for spacing, line thickness, and pressure, produces novel images of handwriting that look hand-made to casual observers, even when printed on paper."}
