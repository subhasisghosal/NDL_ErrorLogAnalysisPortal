This article evaluates two empirical strategies to incorporate such multiword units in a real PCFG-LA parsing context: (1) the use of a grammar including compound recognition, thanks to specialized annotation schemes for compounds; (2) the use of a state-of-the-art discriminative compound prerecognizer integrating endogenous and exogenous features. We show how these two strategies can be combined with word lattices representing possible lexical analyses generated by the recognizer. The proposed systems display significant gains in terms of multiword recognition and often in terms of standard parsing accuracy. Moreover, we show through an Oracle analysis that this combined strategy opens promising new research directions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23088","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23088","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23089","fieldValue":" In this article, we investigate word sense distributions in noun compounds (NCs). Our primary goal is to disambiguate the word sense of component words in NCs, based on investigation of â\u20ACœsemantic collocationâ\u20AC? between them. We use sense collocation and lexical substitution to build supervised and unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) classifiers, and show our unsupervised learner to be superior to a benchmark WSD system. Further, we develop a word sense-based approach to interpreting the semantic relations in NCs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23089","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23089","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3255","fieldValue":" This paper describes a general methodological framework for evaluating the perceptual properties of auditory stimuli. The framework provides analysis techniques that can ensure the effective use of sound for a variety of applications, including virtual reality and data sonification systems. Specifically, we discuss data collection techniques for the perceptual qualities of single auditory stimuli including identification tasks, context-based ratings, and attribute ratings. In addition, we present methods for comparing auditory stimuli, such as discrimination tasks, similarity ratings, and sorting tasks. Finally, we discuss statistical techniques that focus on the perceptual relations among stimuli, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Pathfinder Analysis. These methods are presented as a starting point for an organized and systematic approach for nonexperts in perceptual experimental methods, rather than as a complete manual for performing the statistical techniques and data collection methods. It is our hope that this paper will help foster further interdisciplinary collaboration among perceptual researchers, designers, engineers, and others in the development of effective auditory displays."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3255","fieldValue":"ACM"}
