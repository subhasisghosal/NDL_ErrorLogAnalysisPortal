{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8090","fieldValue":" Electronic concept maps, interlinked with other concept maps and multimedia resources, can provide rich knowledge models to capture and share human knowledge. This article presents and evaluates methods to support experts as they extend existing knowledge models, by suggesting new context-relevant topics mined from Web search engines. The task of generating topics to support knowledge model extension raises two research questions: first, how to extract topic descriptors and discriminators from concept maps; and second, how to use these topic descriptors and discriminators to identify candidate topics on the Web with the right balance of novelty and relevance. To address these questions, this article first develops the theoretical framework required for a â\u20ACœtopic suggesterâ\u20AC? to aid information search in the context of a knowledge model under construction. It then presents and evaluates algorithms based on this framework and applied in Extender, an implemented tool for topic suggestion. Extender has been developed and tested within CmapTools, a widely used system for supporting knowledge modeling using concept maps. However, the generality of the algorithms makes them applicable to a broad class of knowledge modeling systems, and to Web search in general."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/8090","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: University of West Florida, Pensacola, FL (Reichherzer, Thomas); Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bah&#237;a Blanca, Argentina (Lorenzetti, Carlos; Maguitman, Ana); Indiana University, Bloomington, IN (Leake, David; Menczer, Filippo)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8090","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8091","fieldValue":" The growth in pervasive network infrastructure called the Internet of Things (IoT) enables a wide range of physical objects and environments to be monitored in fine spatial and temporal detail. The detailed, dynamic data that are collected in large quantities from sensor devices provide the basis for a variety of applications. Automatic interpretation of these evolving large data is required for timely detection of interesting events. This article develops and exemplifies two new relatives of the visual assessment of tendency (VAT) and improved visual assessment of tendency (iVAT) models, which uses cluster heat maps to visualize structure in static datasets. One new model is initialized with a static VAT\/iVAT image, and then incrementally (hence inc-VAT\/inc-iVAT) updates the current minimal spanning tree (MST) used by VAT with an efficient edge insertion scheme. Similarly, dec-VAT\/dec-iVAT efficiently removes a node from the current VAT MST. A sequence of inc-iVAT\/dec-iVAT images can be used for (visual) anomaly detection in evolving data streams and for sliding window based cluster assessment for time series data. The method is illustrated with four real datasets (three of them being smart city IoT data). The evaluation demonstrates the algorithmsâ\u20AC™ ability to successfully isolate anomalies and visualize changing cluster structure in the streaming data."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8091","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8091","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8092","fieldValue":"Zhu, Wen-Yuan"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8092","fieldValue":"Peng, Wen-Chih"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8092","fieldValue":"Chen, Ling-Jyh"}
