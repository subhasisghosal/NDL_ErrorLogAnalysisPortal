{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4730","fieldValue":" Reconstruction of signaling pathway structures is essential to decipher complex regulatory relationships in living cells. The existing computational approaches often rely on unrealistic biological assumptions and do not explicitly consider signal transduction mechanisms. Signal transduction events refer to linear cascades of reactions from the cell surface to the nucleus and characterize a signaling pathway. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Gene Set Gibbs Sampling (GSGS), to reverse engineer signaling pathway structures from gene sets related to the pathways. We hypothesize that signaling pathways are structurally an ensemble of overlapping linear signal transduction events which we encode as Information Flows (IFs). We infer signaling pathway structures from gene sets, referred to as Information Flow Gene Sets (IFGSs), corresponding to these events. Thus, an IFGS only reflects which genes appear in the underlying IF but not their ordering. GSGS offers a Gibbs sampling like procedure to reconstruct the underlying signaling pathway structure by sequentially inferring IFs from the overlapping IFGSs related to the pathway. In the proof-of-concept studies, our approach is shown to outperform the existing state-of-the-art network inference approaches using both continuous and discrete data generated from benchmark networks in the DREAM initiative. We perform a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of our approach. Finally, we implement GSGS to reconstruct signaling mechanisms in breast cancer cells."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4730","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4730","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4730","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4731","fieldValue":"ElBakry, Ola"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4731","fieldValue":"Swamy, M.

We present here a general statistical method for detecting changes in microarray expression over time within a single biological group and is based on repeated measures (RM) ANOVA. In this method, unlike the classical F-statistic, statistical significance is determined taking into account the time dependency of the microarray data. A correction factor for this RM F-statistic is introduced leading to a higher sensitivity as well as high specificity. We investigate the two approaches that exist in the literature for calculating the p-values using resampling techniques of gene-wise p-values and pooled p-values. It is shown that the pooled p-values method compared to the method of the gene-wise p-values is more powerful, and computationally less expensive, and hence is applied along with the introduced correction factor to various synthetic data sets and a real data set. These results show that the proposed technique outperforms the current methods. The real data set results are consistent with the existing knowledge concerning the presence of the genes.
