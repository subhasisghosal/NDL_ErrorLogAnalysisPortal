The proposed layered BRGC range encoding scheme (L-BRGC) groups ranges into BRGC range sets in which each range can be encoded into a single ternary vector. The results of experiments performed on real-life and synthesized rule tables show that L-BRGC consumes less TCAM than all the existing range encoding schemes for all rule tables, except that the direct conversion scheme (EIGC) using elementary intervals and BRGC codes performs best for a small real-life ACL rule table."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10490","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10491","fieldValue":" This paper proposes FlashLinQ--a synchronous peer-to-peer wireless PHY\/MAC network architecture. FlashLinQ leverages the fine-grained parallel channel access offered by OFDM and incorporates an analog energy-level-based signaling scheme that enables signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based distributed scheduling. This new signaling mechanism, and the concomitant scheduling algorithm, enables efficient channel-aware spatial resource allocation, leading to significant gains over a CSMA\/CA system using RTS\/CTS. FlashLinQ is a complete system architecture including: 1) timing and frequency synchronization derived from cellular spectrum; 2) peer discovery; 3) link management; and 4) channel-aware distributed power, data rate, and link scheduling. FlashLinQ has been implemented for operation over licensed spectrum on a digital signal processor\/ field-programmable gate array (DSP\/FPGA) platform. In this paper, we present FlashLinQ performance results derived from both measurements and simulations."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10491","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10491","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10492","fieldValue":"Hsu, Chih-Cheng"}
