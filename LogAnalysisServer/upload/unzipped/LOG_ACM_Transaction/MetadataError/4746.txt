Instead of sending a unique stream to each newly arriving client, clients share as many multicast transmissions as possible, and are serviced only those parts of the video that they have missed. We present a novel video patching scheme using hierarchies of patches. Our scheme minimizes the bandwidth needed by the video server, and may result in the fact that clients receive several streams in parallel. We show analytically that for Poisson arrival our algorithm achieves the optimal possible server bandwidth for all schemes where clients share multicast transmissions. We also show, how our approach can be combined with batching. This combination requires less server bandwidth than all fixed start point periodic broadcast algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25303","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25304","fieldValue":" Massive Internet media distribution demands prolonged continuous consumption of networking and disk bandwidths in large capacity. Many proxy-based Internet media distribution algorithms and systems have been proposed, implemented, and evaluated to address the scalability and performance issue. However, few of them have been used in practice, since two important issues are not satisfactorily addressed. First, existing proxy-based media distribution architectures lack an efficient media distribution control mechanism. Without copyright protection, content providers are hesitant to use proxy-based fast distribution techniques. Second, little has been done to protect client privacy during content accesses on the Internet. Straightforward solutions to address these two issues independently lead to conflicts. For example, to enforce distribution control, only legitimate users should be granted access rights. However, this normally discloses more information (such as which object the client is accessing) other than the client identity, which conflicts with the client's desire for privacy protection. In this article, we propose a unified proxy-based media distribution protocol to effectively address these two problems simultaneously. We further design a set of new algorithms in a cooperative proxy environment where our proposed scheme works efficiently and practically. Simulation-based experiments are conducted to extensively evaluate the proposed system. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25304","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25304","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25305","fieldValue":" As a commonly used unsupervised learning algorithm in Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm has several limitations, including the curse of dimensionality and the convergence at a local maximum. In this article, we propose a novel learning approach, namely Coevolutionary Feature Synthesized Expectation-Maximization (CFS-EM), to address the above problems. The CFS-EM is a hybrid of coevolutionary genetic programming (CGP) and EM algorithm applied on partially labeled data. CFS-EM is especially suitable for image retrieval because the images can be searched in the synthesized low-dimensional feature space, while a kernel-based method has to make classification computation in the original high-dimensional space. Experiments on real image databases show that CFS-EM outperforms Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM), CGP, Discriminant-EM (D-EM) and Transductive-SVM (TSVM) in the sense of classification performance and it is computationally more efficient than RBF-SVM in the query phase."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25305","fieldValue":"ACM"}
