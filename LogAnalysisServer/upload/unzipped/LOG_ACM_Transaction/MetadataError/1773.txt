In Ackermann et al. [2008] it has been shown that the convergence time of such dynamics to Nash equilibrium may be exponential in the number of players n. Motivated by such a negative result, we focus on the study of the states (not necessarily being equilibria) reached after a limited number of players' selfish moves, and we show that Î˜(n log log n) best responses are necessary and sufficient to achieve states that approximate the optimal solution by a constant factor, under the assumption that every O(n) steps each player performs a constant (and nonnull) number of best responses. We show that such result is tight also for the simplest case of singleton congestion games."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2542","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2542","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16269","fieldValue":" This paper introduces a data-driven process for designing and fabricating materials with desired deformation behavior. Our process starts with measuring deformation properties of base materials. For each base material we acquire a set of example deformations, and we represent the material as a non-linear stress-strain relationship in a finite-element model. We have validated our material measurement process by comparing simulations of arbitrary stacks of base materials with measured deformations of fabricated material stacks. After material measurement, our process continues with designing stacked layers of base materials. We introduce an optimization process that finds the best combination of stacked layers that meets a user's criteria specified by example deformations. Our algorithm employs a number of strategies to prune poor solutions from the combinatorial search space. We demonstrate the complete process by designing and fabricating objects with complex heterogeneous materials using modern multi-material 3D printers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16269","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16269","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16270","fieldValue":" We present a micropolygon ray tracing algorithm that is capable of efficiently rendering high quality defocus and motion blur effects. A key component of our algorithm is a BVH (bounding volume hierarchy) based on 4D hyper-trapezoids that project into 3D OBBs (oriented bounding boxes) in spatial dimensions. This acceleration structure is able to provide tight bounding volumes for scene geometries, and is thus efficient in pruning intersection tests during ray traversal. More importantly, it can exploit the natural coherence on the time dimension in motion blurred scenes. The structure can be quickly constructed by utilizing the micropolygon grids generated during micropolygon tessellation. Ray tracing of defocused and motion blurred scenes is efficiently performed by traversing the structure. Both the BVH construction and ray traversal are easily implemented on GPUs and integrated into a GPU-based micropolygon renderer. In our experiments, our ray tracer performs up to an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-art rasterizers while consistently delivering an image quality equivalent to a maximum-quality rasterizer. We also demonstrate that the ray tracing algorithm can be extended to handle a variety of effects, such as secondary ray effects and transparency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16270","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16270","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16271","fieldValue":"Seidel, Hans-Peter"}
