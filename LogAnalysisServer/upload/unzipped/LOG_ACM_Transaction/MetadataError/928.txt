SDD-1, a System for Distributed Databases, is a prototype distributed database system being developed by Computer Corporation of America. In SDD-1, portions of data distributed throughout a network may be replicated at multiple sites. The SDD-1 concurrency control guarantees database consistency in the face of such distribution and replication.This paper is one of a series of companion papers on SDD-1 [2, 8]."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13863","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/13864","fieldValue":"Veni Madhavan, C.

An efficient algorithm to process the directory for carrying out the node searches is presented. Statistical procedures are developed to estimate the number of nodes searched and the number of data blocks retrieved for most general and complex queries. The performance of inverted file and modified MAT organizations are compared using six real-life databases and four types of query complexities. Careful tradeoffs are established in terms of storage and access times for directory and data, query complexities, and database characteristics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13864","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13865","fieldValue":" To avoid trivial compromises, most on-line statistical databases refuse to answer queries for statistics about small subgroups. Previous research discovered a powerful snooping tool, the tracker, with which the answers to these unanswerable queries are easily calculated. However, the extent of this threat was not clear, for no one had shown that finding a tracker is guaranteed to be easy.This paper gives a simple algorithm for finding a tracker when the maximum number of identical records is not too large. The number of queries required to find a tracker is at most &Ogr;(log2S) queries, where S is the number of distinct records possible. Experimental results show that the procedure often finds a tracker with just a few queries. The threat posed by trackers is therefore considerable."}
