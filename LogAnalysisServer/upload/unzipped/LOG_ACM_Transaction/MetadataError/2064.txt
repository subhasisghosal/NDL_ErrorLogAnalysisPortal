Our approach is based on an approximation of physically correct shadows from distant Gaussian area light sources positioned behind the view plane, using iterative convolution. We present a theoretical and empirical analysis of this model and propose an efficient class of convolution kernels which provide high quality at interactive frame rates. Our GPU-based implementation supports arbitrary volumetric detail maps, requires no precomputation, and therefore allows for real-time modification of all rendering parameters."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17012","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17012","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17013","fieldValue":"Sidorov, Kirill A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17013","fieldValue":" In this article, we introduce a method to apply ideas from electrostatics to parameterize the open space around an object. By simulating the object as a virtually charged conductor, we can define an object-centric coordinate system which we call Electric Coordinates. It parameterizes the outer space of a reference object in a way analogous to polar coordinates. We also introduce a measure that quantifies the extent to which an object is wrapped by a surface. This measure can be computed as the electric flux through the wrapping surface due to the electric field around the charged conductor. The electrostatic parameters, which comprise the Electric Coordinates and flux, have several applications in computer graphics, including: texturing, morphing, meshing, path planning relative to a target object, mesh parameterization, designing deformable objects, and computing coverage. Our method works for objects of arbitrary geometry and topology, and thus is applicable in a wide variety of scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17013","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17013","fieldValue":"ACM"}
