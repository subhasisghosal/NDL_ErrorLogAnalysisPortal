{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11004","fieldValue":" Distributed storage codes have recently received a lot of attention in the community. Independently, another body of work has proposed integrity-checking schemes for cloud storage, none of which, however, is customized for coding-based storage or can efficiently support repair. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two currently disconnected bodies of work. We propose \\ssr NC \\mathchar\"702D Audit, a novel cryptography-based remote data integrity-checking scheme, designed specifically for network-coding-based distributed storage systems. \\ssr NC \\mathchar\"702D Audit combines, for the first time, the following desired properties: 1 efficient checking of data integrity; 2 efficient support for repairing failed nodes; and 3 protection against information leakage when checking is performed by a third party. The key ingredient of the design of \\ssr NC \\mathchar\"702D Audit is a novel combination of \\ssr SpaceMac, a homomorphic message authentication code MAC scheme for network coding, and \\ssr NCrypt, a novel chosen-plaintext attack CPA secure encryption scheme that preserves the correctness of \\ssr SpaceMac. Our evaluation of \\ssr NC \\mathchar\"702D Audit based on a real Java implementation shows that the proposed scheme has significantly lower overhead compared to the state-of-the-art schemes for both auditing and repairing of failed nodes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11004","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11004","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11004","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11005","fieldValue":" Traditional TCP\/IP fingerprinting tools e.g., nmap are poorly suited for Internet-wide use due to the large amount of traffic and intrusive nature of the probes. This can be overcome by approaches that rely on a single SYN packet to elicit a vector of features from the remote server. However, these methods face difficult classification problems due to the high volatility of the features and severely limited amounts of information contained therein. Since these techniques have not been studied before, we first pioneer stochastic theory of single-packet OS fingerprinting, build a database of 116 OSs, design a classifier based on our models, evaluate its accuracy in simulations, and then perform OS classification of 37.8M hosts from an Internet-wide scan."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11005","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Texas A&amp;M University (Shamsi, Zain; Loguinov, Dmitri); Acxiom Corporation, Little Rock (Leonard, Derek); Coinbase Inc., San Fransisco (Nandwani, Ankur); Acxiom Corp., Little Rock, AR, USA (Leonard, Derek); Coinbase Inc., San Fransisco, CA, USA (Nandwani, Ankur); Texas A&amp;M Univ., College Station, TX, USA (Shamsi, Zain)"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11005","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11005","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11005","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11006","fieldValue":"Yang Peng"}
