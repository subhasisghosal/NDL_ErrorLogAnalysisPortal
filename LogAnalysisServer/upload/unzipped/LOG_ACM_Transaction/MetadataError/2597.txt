This article proposes a method to integrate five linguistic resources, including English\/Chinese sense-tagged corpora, English\/Chinese thesauruses, and a bilingual dictionary. Chinese words are mapped into WordNet. A Chinese WordNet and a Chinese-English WordNet are derived by following the structures of WordNet. Experiments with Chinese-English information retrieval are developed to evaluate the applicability of the Chinese-English WordNet. The best model achieves 0.1010 average precision, 69.23% of monolingual information retrieval. It also gains a 10.02% increase relative to a model that resolves translation ambiguity and target polysemy problems together."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2815","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2815","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18747","fieldValue":" Adams predictor-corrector methods, and explicit Rungeâ\u20AC\u201CKutta formulas, have been widely used for the numerical solution of nonstiff initial value problems. Both of these classes of methods have certain drawbacks, however, and it has long been the aim of numerical analysts to derive a class of formulas that has the advantages of both Adams and Rungeâ\u20AC\u201CKutta methods and the disadvantages of neither! In this paper we derive a class of modified Adams formulas that attempts to achieve this aim. When used in a certain precisely defined predictor-corrector mode, these new formulas require three function evaluations per step, but have much better stability than Adams formulas. This improved stability makes the modified Adams formulas particularly effective for mildly stiff problems, and some numerical evidence of this is given. We also consider the performance of the new class of methods on the well-known DETEST test set to show their potential on general nonstiff initial value problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18747","fieldValue":"ACM"}
