This paper investigates first-order conditional logic. We show that, as for first-order probabilistic logic, it is important not to confound statistical conditionals over the domain (such as â\u20ACœmost birds flyâ\u20AC?), and subjective conditionals over possible worlds (such as â\u20ACœI believe that Tweety is unlikely to flyâ\u20AC?). We then address the issue of ascribing semantics to first-order conditional logic. As in the propositional case, there are many possible semantics. To study the problem in a coherent way, we use plausibility structures. These provide us with a general framework in which many of the standard approaches can be embedded. We show that while these standard approaches are all the same at the propositional level, they are significantly different in the context of a first-order language. Furthermore, we show that plausibilities provide the most natural extension of conditional logic to the first-order case:we provide a sound and complete axiomatization that contains only the KLM properties and standard axioms of first-order modal logic. We show that most of the other approaches have additional properties, which result in an inappropriate treatment of an infinitary version of the lottery paradox."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11343","fieldValue":" Agents are small programs that autonomously take actions based on changes in their environment or â\u20ACœstateâ\u20AC?. Over the last few years, there has been an increasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and\/or collaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts Eiter et al. [1999] have shown how agents may be built on top of legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are completely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent's state. Thus, their framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react when the agent is 100% sure about what is true\/false in the world state. In this paper, we propose the concept of a probabilistic agent program and show how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may build a declarative â\u20ACœprobabilisticâ\u20AC? agent program on top of it which supports decision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative semantics for probabilitic programs. We provide sound and complete algorithms to compute the semantics of positive agent programs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11344","fieldValue":"van der Meyden, Ron"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11344","fieldValue":" The semantic framework for the modal logic of knowledge due to Halpern and Moses provides a way to ascribe knowlegde to agents in distributed and multiagent systems. In this paper we study two special cases of this framework: full systems and hypercubes. Both model static situtations in which no agents has any information about another agent's state. Full systems and hypercubes are an appropriate model for the initial configurations of many systems of interest. We establish a correspondence between full systems and hypercube systems and certain classes of Kripke frames. We show that these classes of systems correspond to the same logic. Moreover, this logic is also the same as that generated by the larger class of weakly directed frames. We provide a sound and complete axiomatization, S5WDn of this logic, and study its computational complexity. Finally, we show that under certain natural assumptions, in a model where knowledge evolves over time, S5WDn characteristics the properties of knowledge not just at the initial configuration, but also at all later configurations. In this particular, this holds for homogeneous broadcast systems, which capture settings in which agents are intially ignorant of each others local states, operate synchronously, have perfect recall, and can communicate only by broadcasting."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11344","fieldValue":"ACM"}
