{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13900","fieldValue":" This paper presents the integrity control mechanism of the associative processing system, CASSM. The mechanism takes advantage of the associative techniques, such as content and context addressing, tagging and marking data, parallel processing, automatic triggering of integrity control procedures, etc., for integrity control and as a result offers three significant advantages: (1) The problem of staging data in a main memory for integrity checking can be eliminated because database storage operations are verified at the place where the data are stored. (2) The backout or merging procedures are relatively easy and inexpensive in the associative system because modified copies can be substituted for the originals or may be discarded by merely changing their associated tags. (3) The database management system software is simplified because database integrity functions are handled by the associative processing system to which a mainframe computer is a front-end computer."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13900","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13901","fieldValue":" Frame memory is a virtual view of secondary storage that can be implemented with reasonable overhead to support database record storage and accessing requirements. Frame memory is designed so that its operating characteristics can be easily manipulated by either designers or design algorithms, while performance effects of such changes can be accurately predicted. Automated design procedures exist to generate and evaluate alternative database designs built upon frame memory, and the existence of these procedures establishes frames as an attractive memory management architecture for future database management systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13901","fieldValue":"Frame memory: a storage architecture to support rapid design and implementation of efficient databases"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13901","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13901","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2312","fieldValue":"Fusy, ric"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2312","fieldValue":" We present a bijection between some quadrangular dissections of an hexagon and unrooted binary trees with interesting consequences for enumeration, mesh compression, and graph sampling. Our bijection yields an efficient uniform random sampler for 3-connected planar graphs, which turns out to be determinant for the quadratic complexity of the current best-known uniform random sampler for labelled planar graphs. It also provides an encoding for the set P(n) of n-edge 3-connected planar graphs that matches the entropy bound 1\/n $log_2 &verbar;P(n)&verbar; &equals; 2 &plus; o(1) bits per edge (bpe). This solves a theoretical problem recently raised in mesh compression as these graphs abstract the combinatorial part of meshes with spherical topology. We also achieve the optimal parametric rate 1\/n log2$ &verbar;P(n, i, j)&verbar; bpe for graphs of P(n) with i vertices and j faces, matching in particular the optimal rate for triangulations. Our encoding relies on a linear time algorithm to compute an orientation associated with the minimal Schnyder wood of a 3-connected planar map. This algorithm is of independent interest, and it is, for instance, a key ingredient in a recent straight line drawing algorithm for 3-connected planar graphs."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2312","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: LIX, &#201;cole polytechnique, France (Fusy, ric; Schaeffer, Gilles); LIAFA, Universit&#233; Paris 7, France (Poulalhon, Dominique)"}
