Understanding such sketches, however, requires special skills to form a mental 3D representation of the product geometry by linking parts across the different sketches and imagining the intermediate object configurations. Hence, the sketches can remain inaccessible to many, especially non-designers. We present a system to facilitate easy interpretation and exploration of concept sketches. Starting from crudely specified incomplete geometry, often inconsistent across the different views, we propose a globally-coupled analysis to extract part correspondence and inter-part junction information that best explain the different sketch views. The user can then interactively explore the abstracted object to gain better understanding of the product functions. Our key technical contribution is performing shape analysis without access to any coherent 3D geometric model by reasoning in the space of inter-part relations. We evaluate our system on various concept sketches obtained from popular product design books and websites."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16837","fieldValue":"NPR"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16837","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16837","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16838","fieldValue":" This paper discusses stereoscopic 3D imaging based on line drawing of 3D shapes. We describe the major issues and challenges in generating stereoscopic 3D effects using lines only, with a couple of relatively simple approaches called each-eye-based and center-eye-based. Each of these methods has its shortcomings, such as binocular rivalry and inaccurate lines. We explain why and how these problems occur, then describe the concept of stereo-coherent lines and an algorithm to extract them from 3D shapes. We also propose a simple method to stylize stereo lines that ensures the stereo coherence of stroke textures across binocular views. The proposed method provides viewers with unique visual experience of watching 2D drawings popping out of the screen like 3D."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16838","fieldValue":"ACM"}
