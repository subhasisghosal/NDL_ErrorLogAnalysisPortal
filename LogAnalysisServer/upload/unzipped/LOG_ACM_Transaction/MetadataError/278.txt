This article presents a new scheduler, called the Bimodal Modulo Scheduler (BMS), to map inner loops onto (heterogeneous) CGRAs of the Architecture for Dynamically Reconfigurable Embedded Systems (ADRES) family. BMS significantly outperforms existing schedulers for similar architectures in terms of generated code quality and compilation time. This is achieved by combining new schemes for backtracking with extended and adapted forms of priority functions and cost functions, as described in the article. BMS is evaluated by mapping multimedia and software-defined radio benchmarks onto tuned ADRES instances."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2079","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2079","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11781","fieldValue":" The equational theory of deterministic monadic recursion schemes is known to be decidable by the result of SÃ©nizergues on the decidability of the problem of DPDA equivalence. In order to capture some properties of the domain of computation, we augment equations with certain hypotheses. This preserves the decidability of the theory, which we call simple implicational theory. The asymptotically fastest algorithm known for deciding the equational theory, and also for deciding the simple implicational theory, has a running time that is nonelementary. We therefore consider a restriction of the properties about schemes to check: instead of arbitrary equations f â\u2030¡ g between schemes, we focus on propositional Hoare assertions {p}f{q}, where f is a scheme and p, q are tests. Such Hoare assertions have a straightforward encoding as equations. For this subclass of program properties, we can also handle nondeterminism at the syntactic and\/or at the semantic level, without increasing the complexity of the theories. We investigate the Hoare theory of monadic recursion schemes, that is, the set of valid implications whose conclusions are Hoare assertions and whose premises are of a certain simple form. We present a sound and complete Hoare-style calculus for this theory. We also show that the Hoare theory can be decided in exponential time, and that it is complete for this class."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11781","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11781","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11782","fieldValue":" Marx and de Rijke have shown that the navigational core of the w3c XML query language XPath is not first-order complete; that is, it cannot express every query definable in first-order logic over the navigational predicates.

A number of examples underpin the universality of these constructions, the most prominent ones being separation logics, where convolution is separating conjunction in an assertion quantale; interval logics, where convolution is the chop operation; and stream interval functions, where convolution is proposed for analysing the trajectories of dynamical or real-time systems. A Hoare logic can be constructed in a generic fashion on the power-series quantale, which applies to each of these examples. In many cases, commutative notions of convolution have natural interpretations as concurrency operations."}
