{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11792","fieldValue":" For a given regular language of infinite trees, one can ask about the minimal number of priorities needed to recognize this language with a nondeterministic, alternating, or weak alternating parity automaton. These questions are known as, respectively, the nondeterministic, alternating, and weak Rabin-Mostowski index problems. Whether they can be answered effectively is a long-standing open problem, solved so far only for languages recognizable by deterministic automata (the alternating variant trivializes). We investigate a wider class of regular languages, recognizable by so-called game automata, which can be seen as the closure of deterministic ones under complementation and composition. Game automata are known to recognize languages arbitrarily high in the alternating Rabin-Mostowski index hierarchy; that is, the alternating index problem does not trivialize anymore. Our main contribution is that all three index problems are decidable for languages recognizable by game automata. Additionally, we show that it is decidable whether a given regular language can be recognized by a game automaton."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11792","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11793","fieldValue":" We study on which classes of graphs first-order logic (fo) and monadic second-order logic (mso) have the same expressive power. We show that for all classes C of graphs that are closed under taking subgraphs, fo and mso have the same expressive power on C if and only if, C has bounded tree depth. Tree depth is a graph invariant that measures the similarity of a graph to a star in a similar way that tree width measures the similarity of a graph to a tree. For classes just closed under taking induced subgraphs, we show an analogous result for guarded second-order logic (gso), the variant of mso that not only allows quantification over vertex sets but also over edge sets. A key tool in our proof is a Feferman--Vaught-type theorem that works for infinite collections of structures despite being constructive."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11793","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany (Elberfeld, Michael; Grohe, Martin); Universit&#228;t zu L&#252;beck, L&#252;beck, Germany (Tantau, Till)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11793","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11793","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11794","fieldValue":" We study the proof complexity of Paris-Harrington‚\u20ACôs Large Ramsey Theorem for bi-colorings of graphs and of off-diagonal Ramsey‚\u20ACôs Theorem. For Paris-Harrington, we prove a non-trivial conditional lower bound in Resolution and a non-trivial upper bound in bounded-depth Frege. The lower bound is conditional on a (very reasonable) hardness assumption for a weak (quasi-polynomial) Pigeonhole principle in Res(2). We show that under such an assumption, there is no refutation of the Paris-Harrington formulas of size quasi-polynomial in the number of propositional variables. The proof technique for the lower bound extends the idea of using a combinatorial principle to blow up a counterexample for another combinatorial principle beyond the threshold of inconsistency. A strong link with the proof complexity of an unbalanced off-diagonal Ramsey principle is established. This is obtained by adapting some constructions due to Erd≈\u2018s and Mills. We prove a non-trivial Resolution lower bound for a family of such off-diagonal Ramsey principles."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11794","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Universitat Polit&#232;cnica de Catalunya, Catalonia, Spain (Lauria, Massimo); University of Rome I, Roma (Carlucci, Lorenzo; Galesi, Nicola)"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/11794","fieldValue":"Paris-Harrington&rsquo;s principle"}
