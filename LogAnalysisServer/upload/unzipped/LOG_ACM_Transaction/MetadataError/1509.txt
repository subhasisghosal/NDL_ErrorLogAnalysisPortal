While a number of sophisticated approaches based on Monte Carlo and finite element simulation have been developed, those methods do not work at interactive rates. The most common real-time methods are essentially simple variants of the OpenGL fog model. While easy to use and specify, that model excludes many important qualitative effects like glows around light sources, the impact of volumetric scattering on the appearance of surfaces such as the diffusing of glossy highlights, and the appearance under complex lighting such as environment maps. In this paper, we present an alternative physically based approach that captures these effects while maintaining real time performance and the ease-of-use of the OpenGL fog model. Our method is based on an explicit analytic integration of the single scattering light transport equations for an isotropic point light source in a homogeneous participating medium. We can implement the model in modern programmable graphics hardware using a few small numerical lookup tables stored as texture maps. Our model can also be easily adapted to generate the appearances of materials with arbitrary BRDFs, environment map lighting, and precomputed radiance transfer methods, in the presence of participating media. Hence, our techniques can be widely used in real-time rendering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15595","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15595","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15596","fieldValue":" Many interactive applications strive for realistic renderings, but framerate constraints usually limit realism to effects that run efficiently in graphics hardware. One effect largely ignored in such applications is refraction. We introduce a simple, image-space approach to refractions that easily runs on modern graphics cards. Our method requires two passes on a GPU, and allows refraction of a distant environment through two interfaces, compared to current interactive techniques that are restricted to a single interface. Like all image-based algorithms, aliasing can occur in certain circumstances, but the plausible refractions generated with our approach should suffice for many applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15596","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15596","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15597","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15597","fieldValue":" Many translucent materials consist of evenly-distributed heterogeneous elements which produce a complex appearance under different lighting and viewing directions. For these quasi-homogeneous materials, existing techniques do not address how to acquire their material representations from physical samples in a way that allows arbitrary geometry models to be rendered with these materials. We propose a model for such materials that can be readily acquired from physical samples. This material model can be applied to geometric models of arbitrary shapes, and the resulting objects can be efficiently rendered without expensive subsurface light transport simulation. In developing a material model with these attributes, we capitalize on a key observation about the subsurface scattering characteristics of quasi-homogeneous materials at different scales. Locally, the non-uniformity of these materials leads to inhomogeneous subsurface scattering. For subsurface scattering on a global scale, we show that a lengthy photon path through an even distribution of heterogeneous elements statistically resembles scattering in a homogeneous medium. This observation allows us to represent and measure the global light transport within quasi-homogeneous materials as well as the transfer of light into and out of a material volume through surface mesostructures. We demonstrate our technique with results for several challenging materials that exhibit sophisticated appearance features such as transmission of back illumination through surface mesostructures."}
