These techniques allow viewers to perform simple data analysis tasks such as detection of data groups and boundaries, target detection, and estimation. The goal is to do this rapidly and accurately on a dynamic sequence of data frames. Our techniques take advantage of an ability of the human visual system called preattentive processing. Preattentive processing refers to an initial organization of the visual system based on operations believed to be rapid, automatic, and spatially parallel. Examples of visual features that can be detected in this way include hue, orientation, intensity, size, curvature, and line length. We believe that studies from preattentive processing should be used to assist in the design of visualization tools, especially those for which high speed target, boundary, and region detection are important. Previous work has shown that results from research in preattentive processing can be used to build visualization tools that allow rapid and accurate analysis of individual, static data frames. We extend these techniques to a dynamic real-time environment. This allows users to perform similar tasks on dynamic sequences of frames, exactly like those generated by real-time systems such as visual interactive simulation. We studied two known preattentive features, hue and curvature. The primary question investigated was whether rapid and accurate target and boundary detection in dynamic sequences is possible using these features. Behavioral experiments were run that simulated displays from our preattentive visualization tools. Analysis of the results of the experiments showed that rapid and accurate target and boundary detection is possible with both hue and curvature. A second question, whether interactions occur between the two features in a real-time environment, was answered positively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24744","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24745","fieldValue":" We describe a system for off-line production and real-time playback of motion for articulated human figures in 3D virtual environments. The key notion are (1) the logical storage of full-body motion in posture graphs, which provides a simple motion access method for playback, and (2) mapping the motions of high DOF figures to lower DOF figures using slaving to provide human models at several levels of detail, both in geometry and articulation, for later playback. We present our system in the context of a simple problem: animating human figures in a distributed simulation, using DIS protocols for communicating the human state information. We also discuss several related techniques for real-time animation of articulated figures in visual simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24745","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24745","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3391","fieldValue":" An experiment was carried out to examine the impact on electrodermal activity of people when approached by groups of one or four virtual characters at varying distances. It was premised on the basis of proxemics theory that the closer the approach of the virtual characters to the participant, the greater the level of physiological arousal. Physiological arousal was measured by the number of skin conductance responses within a short time period after the approach, and the maximum change in skin conductance level 5 s after the approach. The virtual characters were each either female or a cylinder of human size, and one or four characters approached each subject a total of 12 times. Twelve male subjects were recruited for the experiment. The results suggest that the number of skin conductance responses after the approach and the change in skin conductance level increased the closer the virtual characters approached toward the participants. Moreover, these response variables were inversely correlated with the number of visits, showing a typical adaptation effect. There was some evidence to suggest that the number of characters who simultaneously approached (one or four) was positively associated with the responses. Surprisingly there was no evidence of a difference in response between the humanoid characters and cylinders on the basis of this physiological data. It is suggested that the similarity in this quantitative arousal response to virtual characters and virtual objects might mask a profound difference in qualitative response, an interpretation supported by questionnaire and interview results. Overall the experiment supported the premise that people exhibit heightened physiological arousal the closer they are approached by virtual characters."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3391","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3391","fieldValue":"ACM"}
