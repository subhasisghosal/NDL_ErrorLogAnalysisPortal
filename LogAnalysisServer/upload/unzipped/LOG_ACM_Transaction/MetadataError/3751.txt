However, the development of such protocols is itself difficult, and prior systems have exhibited high overheads, primarily due to the cost of digital signatures. The SecureRing group communication system provides secure, reliable, totally-ordered message delivery and group membership services despite the malicious corruption of a constant fraction of the processors within the system. The network is assumed not to partition, and persistent communication faults are handled as processor faults. The SecureRing message delivery protocol makes use of message digests in a signed token to allow a single digital signature to cover multiple messages, and to avoid the need for multiple rounds of message exchange in normal operation. While these techniques mean that messages are not authenticated in real time, they enable the SecureRing protocols to achieve high throughput and reasonable latency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22125","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22125","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22126","fieldValue":" Abstraction is an important issue in intrusion detection, since it not only hides the difference between heterogeneous systems, but also allows generic intrusion-detection models. However, abstraction is an error-prone process and is not well supported in current intrusion-detection systems (IDSs). This article presents a hierarchical model to support attack specification and event abstraction in distributed intrusion detection. The model involves three concepts: system view, signature, and view definition. A system view provides an abstract interface of a particular type of information; defined on the instances of system views, a signature specifies certain distributed attacks or events to be monitored; a view definition is then used to derive information from the matches of a signature and presents it through a system view. With the three elements, the model provides a hierarchical framework for maintaining signatures, system views, as well as event abstraction. As a benefit, the model allows generic signatures that can accommodate unknown variants of known attacks. Moreover, abstraction represented by a system view can be updated without changing either its specification or the signatures specified on its basis. This article then presents a decentralized method for autonomous but cooperative component systems to detect distributed attacks specified by signatures. Specifically, a signature is decomposed into finer units, called detection tasks, each of which represents the activity to be monitored on a component system. The component systems (involved in a signature) then perform the detection tasks cooperatively according to the \"dependency\" relationships among these tasks. An experimental system called CARDS has been implemented to test the feasibility of the proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22126","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22127","fieldValue":" Public key management has received considerable attention from both the research and commercial communities as a useful primitive for secure electronic commerce and secure communication. While the mechanics of certifying and revoking public keys and escrowing and recovering private keys have been widely explored, less attention has been paid to access control frameworks for regulating access to stored keys by different parties. In this article we propose such a framework for a key management service that supports public key registration, lookup, and revocation, and private key escrow, protected use (e.g., to decrypt selected messages), and recovery. We propose an access control model using a policy based on principal, ownership, and authority relationships on keys. The model allows owners to grant to others (and revoke) privileges to execute various actions on their keys. The simple authorization language is very expressive, enabling the specification of authorizations for composite subjects that can be fully specified (ground) or partially specified, thus making the authorizations applicable to all subjects satisfying some conditions. We illustrate how the access control policy and the authorizations can easily be expressed through a simple and restricted, hence efficiently computable, form of logic language."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22127","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22127","fieldValue":"ACM"}
