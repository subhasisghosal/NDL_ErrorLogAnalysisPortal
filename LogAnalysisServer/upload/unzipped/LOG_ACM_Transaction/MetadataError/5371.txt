High-dimensional data typically have much more variables than observations, and contain significant noise, missing components, or outliers. Features extracted from high-dimensional data need to be discriminative, sparse, and can capture essential characteristics of the data. In this paper, we present a way to constructing multivariate features and then classify the data into proper classes. The resulting small subset of features is nearly the best in the sense of Greenshtein's persistence; however, the estimated feature weights may be biased. We take a systematic approach for correcting the biases. We use conjugate gradient-based primal-dual interior-point techniques for large-scale problems. We apply our procedure to microarray gene analysis. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed by experimental results."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4523","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4523","fieldValue":"High-dimensional data, feature selection, persistence, bias, convex optimization, primal-dual interior-point optimization, cancer classification, microarray gene analysis."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_MULTIPLE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4524","fieldValue":"Upton, G.

Foremost, among the new tools for biochemistry are chip arrays which, in one operation, measure hundreds of thousands or even millions of DNA sequences or RNA transcripts. While this is impressive, increasingly sophisticated analysis tools have been required to convert gene array data into gene expression levels. Despite the assumption that noise levels are low, since the number of measurements for an individual gene is small, identifying which signals are affected by noise is a priority. High-density oligonucleotide array (HDONAs) from NCBI GEO shows that, even in the best Human GeneChips 1\/4 percent of data are affected by spatial noise. Earlier designs are noisier and spatial defects may affect more than 25 percent of probes.
