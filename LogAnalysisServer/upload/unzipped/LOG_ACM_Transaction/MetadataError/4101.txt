Modeling our experiment after this study, we directly examined the effect of viscous resistance on the perceived roughness magnitude of virtual gratings using a PHANTOM. For each virtual grating, the resistance level encountered at the ridges was varied by altering the viscosity coefficient. Perceived roughness systematically increased as the value of the viscosity coefficient was increased. The ridge-to-groove ratio contributed a small additional effect of microgeometry. These results suggest that simple models of viscous resistance may be used to simulate varying levels of surface roughness."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3266","fieldValue":"The perceived roughness of resistive virtual textures: II. effects of varying viscosity with a force-feedback device"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23231","fieldValue":" With organizations increasingly depending on Web services to build complex applications, security and privacy concerns including the protection of access control policies are becoming a serious issue. Ideally, service providers would like to make sure that clients have knowledge of only portions of the access control policy relevant to their interactions to the extent to which they are entrusted by the Web service and without restricting the clientâ\u20AC™s choices in terms of which operations to execute. We propose ACConv, a novel model for access control in Web services that is suitable when interactions between the client and the Web service are conversational and long-running. The conversation-based access control model proposed in this article allows service providers to limit how much knowledge clients have about the credentials specified in their access policies. This is achieved while reducing the number of times credentials are asked from clients and minimizing the risk that clients drop out of a conversation with the Web service before reaching a final state due to the lack of necessary credentials. Clients are requested to provide credentials, and hence are entrusted with part of the Web service access control policies, only for some specific granted conversations which are decided based on: (1) a level of trust that the Web service provider has vis-Ã -vis the client, (2) the operation that the client is about to invoke, and (3) meaningful conversations which represent conversations that lead to a final state from the current one. We have implemented the proposed approach in a software prototype and conducted extensive experiments to show its effectiveness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23231","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23232","fieldValue":" The ability to compute the differences that exist between two RDF\/S Knowledge Bases (KB) is an important step to cope with the evolving nature of the Semantic Web (SW). In particular, RDF\/S deltas can be employed to reduce the amount of data that need to be exchanged and managed over the network in order to build SW synchronization and versioning services. By considering deltas as sets of change operations, in this article we introduce various RDF\/S differential functions which take into account inferred knowledge from an RDF\/S knowledge base. We first study their correctness in transforming a source to a target RDF\/S knowledge base in conjunction with the semantics of the employed change operations (i.e., with or without side-effects on inferred knowledge). Then we formally analyze desired properties of RDF\/S deltas such as size minimality, semantic identity, redundancy elimination, reversibility, and composability, as well as identify those RDF\/S differential functions that satisfy them. Subsequently, we experimentally evaluate the computing time and size of the produced deltas over real and synthetic RDF\/S knowledge bases."}
