We use this formulation to generate test problems with known optimal solutions. The technique uses the KKT optimality conditions on the corresponding quadratically constrained optimization problem."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18775","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18776","fieldValue":" An implementation of a method for numerical multiple integration based on a sequence of imbedded lattice rules is given. Besides yielding an approximation to the integral, this implementation also provides an error estimate which does not require much extra computation.

In this paper a new thinning method is presented which differs in its approach from other thinning algorithms. In the presented algorithm the minimal distance of a pixel to the edge of the containing object is used to extract the skeleton. Given an n x n matrix of pixels, the algorithm runs in time O(n2). Our measurements show that it is faster than other known sequential algorithms. The mathematical background of the algorithm and the proof of essential features of the obtained skeleton are based on the consideration of the pattern as a directed graph."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18778","fieldValue":"ACM"}
