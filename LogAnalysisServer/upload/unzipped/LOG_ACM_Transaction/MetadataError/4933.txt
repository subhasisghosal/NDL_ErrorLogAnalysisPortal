We showed participants stereo photographs with different depths of field using a Wheatstone stereoscope and a commercially available 3D TV. The depicted scene contained a floor, a background, and a measuring probe at different locations. Participants drew a floor plan of the depicted scene to scale. We found that perceived depth decreased with decreasing depth of field for shallow depths of field in scenes containing a height-in-the-field cue. For larger depths of field, different effects were found depending on the display system and the viewing distance. There was no effect on perceived depth using the 3D TV, but perceived depth decreased with increasing depth of field using the Wheatstone stereoscope. However, in the 3D TV case, we found that the perceived depth decreased with increasing depth of field in scenes in which the height-in-the-field cue was removed. This indicates that the effect of depth of field on perceived depth may be influenced by other depth cues in the scene, such as height-in-the-field cues."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3489","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3490","fieldValue":" Visual exploration of clouds of data points is an important application of virtual environments. The common goal of this activity is to use the strengths of human perception to identify interesting structures in data, which are often not detected using traditional, computational analysis methods. In this article, we seek to identify some of the parameters that affect how well structures in visualized data clouds can be identified by a human observer. Two of the primary factors tested are the volumetric densities of the visualized structures and the presence\/absence of clutter around the displayed structures. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to glyph visualizationâ\u20AC\u201Dconstant visual angle (CVA) glyphsâ\u20AC\u201Dwhich has the potential to mitigate the effect of clutter at the cost of dispensing with the common real-world depth cue of relative size. In a controlled experiment where test subjects had to locate and select visualized structures in an immersive virtual environment, we identified several significant results. One result is that CVA glyphs ease perception of structures in cluttered environments while not deteriorating it when clutter is absent. Another is the existence of threshold densities, above which perception of structures becomes easier and more precise."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3490","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3491","fieldValue":"Price, Larry R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3491","fieldValue":" This article proposes and evaluates a novel biometric approach utilizing the internal, nonvisible, anatomical structure of the human eye. The proposed method estimates the anatomical properties of the human oculomotor plant from the measurable properties of human eye movements, utilizing a two-dimensional linear homeomorphic model of the oculomotor plant. The derived properties are evaluated within a biometric framework to determine their efficacy in both verification and identification scenarios. The results suggest that the physical properties derived from the oculomotor plant model are capable of achieving 20.3&percnt; equal error rate and 65.7&percnt; rank-1 identification rate on high-resolution equipment involving 32 subjects, with biometric samples taken over four recording sessions; or 22.2&percnt; equal error rate and 12.6&percnt; rank-1 identification rate on low-resolution equipment involving 172 subjects, with biometric samples taken over two recording sessions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3491","fieldValue":"ACM"}
