Some Programming by Demonstration (PBD) systems do provide such support, but none provide full support for demonstrating interfaces, such as those in games, in which the graphics are animated. This article proposes a number of techniques for creating animated interfaces, all of which have been included in an exploratory system, Pavlov. Many of the techniques are based on the addition of timing controls to a form of PBD called stimulus-response demonstration. Others are based on an adaptation of a traditional animation time-line that integrates end-user interaction with animation. The article also evaluates Pavlov with (1) a comparison to other PBD systems in terms of the behaviors that can be specified interactively and (2) a report on an informal user study comparing development in Pavlov to development in a conventional interface builder."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5532","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5533","fieldValue":"Author index"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5533","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5533","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1463","fieldValue":"Pysander, Eva-Lotta Sallns"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1463","fieldValue":" In the study presented here, two haptic and visual applications for learning geometrical concepts in group work in primary school have been designed and evaluated. The aim was to support collaborative learning among sighted and visually impaired pupils. The first application is a static flattened 3D environment that supports learning to distinguish between angles by means of a 3D haptic device providing touch feedback. The second application is a dynamic 3D environment that supports learning of spatial geometry. The scene is a room with a box containing geometrical objects, which pupils can pick up and move around. The applications were evaluated in four schools with groups of two sighted and one visually impaired pupil. The results showed the support for the visually impaired pupil and for the collaboration to be satisfying. A shared understanding of the workspace could be achieved, as long as the virtual environment did not contain movable objects. Verbal communication was crucial for the work process but haptic guiding to some extent substituted communication about direction. When it comes to joint action between visually impaired and sighted pupils a number of interesting problems were identified when the dynamic and static virtual environments were compared. These problems require further investigation. The study extends prior work in the areas of assistive technology and multimodal communication by evaluating functions for joint haptic manipulation in the unique setting of group work in primary school."}
