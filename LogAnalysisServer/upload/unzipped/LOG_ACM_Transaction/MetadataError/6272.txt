We present an efficient logic-based unicast and multicast routing algorithm that guarantees isolation of local application traffic within any near-convex region on the chip, and the algorithms to recognize supported partitions and configure the cores accordingly. Evaluations show that the routing algorithm has a 57&percent; more compact implementation than a recent multicast solution with the same coverage, and it achieves 5&percent; higher throughput with 13&percent; lower latency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6703","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6703","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6704","fieldValue":"Sarbazi-Azad, Hamid"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6704","fieldValue":" Many classes of applications require Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees from the system interconnect. In Networks-on-Chip (NoC) QoS guarantees usually translate into bandwidth and latency constraints for the traffic flows and require hardware support in the NoC fabric and its interfaces. In this article we present a novel NoC synthesis framework to automatically build networks that meet hard latency constraints of end-to-end traffic streams without requiring specialized hardware for the network components. The hard latency constraints are met by carefully designing the NoC topology and selecting the appropriate routes for flow using lean best-effort network components. We perform experiments on several System on Chip (SoC) benchmarks. We compared against a topology synthesis method with no support for real-time constraints and we show that the proposed method can produce topologies that can meet significantly tighter worst case latency constraints (on average 44&percnt;). We also show that the tightest worst case latency can be provided with little overhead on power consumption (on average 8.5&percnt;)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6704","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6704","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6705","fieldValue":" Similar to off-chip networks, current NoC architectures are based on the store and forward of uncoordinated end-to-end packet transmissions through autonomous buffered routers. However, the monolithic nature and the small physical dimensions of on chip networks open up the opportunity for much more tightly controlled architectures. We present GANA, a new Global Arbiter NoC Architecture. In GANA, the transmission of end-to-end data is timed by a global arbiter in a way that avoids any queuing in the network. The arbitration takes into account the complete transfer of the end-to-end packets through the entire network path, avoiding any intermediate queuing and hop-by-hop packet arbitration. Consequently, buffers and arbiters are no longer required in the routers, resulting in smaller area and low power consumption. It is demonstrated through detailed design and synthesis that the additional area of the central arbiter and the control path are negligible in comparison to the provided area saving. For example, an 8Ã\u2014 8 GANA consumes only 16&percnt; of the area of an equivalent autonomous NoC while providing a better end-to-end throughput. The end-to-end performance of GANA at high network loads is typically much better than in a distributed-control NOC, because resource contention and queuing in the network are avoided. This comes at the cost of a few percentage increase in latency at light loads due to the additional arbitration phase. GANA architecture combines the inherent benefits of a network (parallelism and spatial reuse of links) with the inherent benefits of high integration (global view of the system state, central control, and synchronization). The scalability of GANA is evaluated analytically, showing that it can be superior to fully-distributed networks in systems up to a size of about 100 modules manufactured in 45nm technology, which can be used today as well as in the foreseeable future."}
