For example, Internet content providers often place data and server mirrors throughout the Internet to improve access latency for clients, and it is necessary to direct clients to the nearest mirrors based on some distance metric in order to realize the benefit of mirrors. We suggest a scalable Internet-wide architecture, called IDMaps, which measures and disseminates distance information on the global Internet. Higher level services can collect such distance information to build a virtual distance map of the Internet and estimate the distance between any pair of IP addresses. We present our solutions to the measurement server placement and distance map construction problems in IDMaps. We show that IDMaps can indeed provide useful distance estimations to applications such as nearest mirror selection."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9047","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9047","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9048","fieldValue":" In this paper, we consider broadcast-and-select networks based on optical passive stars. In these single-hop networks, communicating pairs can exchange messages directly, without the need to store information at intermediate nodes for later forwarding. Messages are transmitted in a packetized way, and each message has an associated deadline. In order to guarantee the message reception timeliness, we ask that all the messages are received within their corresponding deadline. We show that this scheduling problem is strong NP-complete, even in a very restricted case. Then, we turn our attention to fast approximating heuristics. We present four of them, assess their average performance by means of computer simulation, and give their worst-case performance bounds. Such bounds can be effectively used to test the success of the schedule before generating it."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9048","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
