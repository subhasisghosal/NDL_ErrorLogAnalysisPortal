However, conventional classifier learners require large amounts of data to avoid overfitting, or do not generalize well to unseen examples. To learn dialogue classifiers using a rich feature set and fewer data points than features, we apply a recent technique, $&ell;_1$-regularized logistic regression. We demonstrate this approach empirically on real data from Project LISTEN's Reading Tutor, which displays a story on a computer screen and listens to a child read aloud. We train a classifier to predict task completion (i.e., whether the student will finish reading the story) with 71&percnt; accuracy on a balanced, unseen test set. To characterize differences in the behavior of children when they choose the story they read, we likewise train and test a classifier that with 73.6&percnt; accuracy infers who chose the story based on the ensuing dialogue. Both classifiers significantly outperform baselines and reveal relevant features of the dialogue."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/23055","fieldValue":"&ell;<sub>1<\/sub>-regularized logistic regression"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23055","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23055","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23056","fieldValue":" Recent studies show that user simulations can be used to generate training corpora for learning dialogue strategies automatically. However, it is unclear what type of simulation is most suitable in a particular task setting. We observe that a simulation which generates random behaviors in a restricted way outperforms simulations that mimic human user behaviors in a statistical way. Our finding suggests that we do not always need to construct a realistic user simulation. Since constructing realistic user simulations is not a trivial task, we can save engineering cost by wisely choosing simulation models that are appropriate for our task."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23056","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23056","fieldValue":"ACM"}
