The transformation of the Hamiltonian matrix to a square-reduced form transforms a Hamiltonian eigenvalue problem of order 2n to a Hessenberg eigenvalue problem of order n. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix are the square roots of those of the Hessenberg matrix. Symplectic scaling and norm scaling are provided, which, in some cases, improve the accuracy of the computed eigenvalues. We demonstrate the performance of the subroutines for several examples and show how they can be used to solve some control-theoretic problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_LOWER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18964","fieldValue":"(square-reduced)"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18964","fieldValue":"Algorithm 800: Fortran 77 subroutines for computing the eigenvalues of Hamiltonian matrices.
