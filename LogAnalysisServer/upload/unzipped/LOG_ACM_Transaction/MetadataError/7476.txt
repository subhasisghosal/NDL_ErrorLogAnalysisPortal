We use a fluid model approach to describe steady-state or transient phenomena and apply it to the Chord system. For any rate of churn and stabilization rates and any system size, we accurately account for the functional form of the probability of network disconnection as well as the fraction of failed or incorrect successor and finger pointers. We show how we can use these quantities to predict both the performance and consistency of lookups under churn. All theoretical predictions match simulation results. The analysis includes both features that are generic to structured overlays deploying a ring as well as Chord-specific details and opens the door to a systematic comparative analysis of, at least, ring-based structured overlay systems under churn."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9761","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9761","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9761","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9762","fieldValue":" We consider a multi-hop wireless network shared by many users. For an interference model that constrains a node to either transmit to or receive from only one other node at a time, and not to do both, we propose an architecture for fair resource allocation that consists of a distributed scheduling algorithm operating in conjunction with an asynchronous congestion control algorithm. We show that the proposed joint congestion control and scheduling algorithm supports at least one-third of the throughput supportable by any other algorithm, including centralized algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9762","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9762","fieldValue":"Asynchronous congestion control in multi-hop wireless networks with maximal matching-based scheduling"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9762","fieldValue":"ACM"}
