While several models exist for asynchronous CSMA contention used in protocols like IEEE 802.11 MAC, no model exists for synchronized CSMA contention that also incorporates realistic factors like clock drifts. In this paper, we introduce a model that quantifies the interplay of clock drifts with contention window size, control packet size, and carrier sense regulated by usage of guard time. Using a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based MAC protocol implementation and controlled experiments on a wireless testbed, we evaluate the model predictions on the isolated and combined impact of these key performance factors to per-flow throughput and fairness properties in both single-hop and multihop networks. Our model and experimental evaluation reveal conditions on protocol parameters under which the throughput of certain flows can exponentially decrease; while at the same time, it enables solutions that can offset such problems in a predictable manner."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10501","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10501","fieldValue":"CSMA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10501","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10501","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10502","fieldValue":" Optimality conditions for Call Admission Control (CAC) problems with nonlinearly constrained feasibility regions and K classes of users are derived. The adopted model is a generalized stochastic knapsack, with exponentially distributed interarrival times of the objects. Call admission strategies are restricted to the family of Coordinate-Convex (CC) policies. For K = 2 classes of users, both general structural properties of the optimal CC policies and structural properties that depend on the revenue ratio are investigated. Then, the analysis is extended to the case K > 2. The theoretical results are exploited to narrow the set of admissible solutions to the associated knapsack problem, i.e., the set of CC policies to which an optimal one belongs. With respect to results available in the literature, less restrictive conditions on the optimality of the complete-sharing policy are obtained. To illustrate the role played by the theoretical results on the combinatorial CAC problem, simulation results are presented, which show how the number of candidate optimal CC policies dramatically decreases as the derived optimality conditions are imposed."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10502","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10502","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10502","fieldValue":"ACM"}
