OBE, an extension of Query-by-Example, supports various office features such as database tables, word processing, electronic mail, graphics, images, and so forth. These seemingly heterogeneous features are integrated through a language feature called example elements. Applications involving example elements are processed by the database manager, an integrated part of the OBE system. In this paper we describe the facilities and architecture of the OBE system and discuss the techniques for integrating heterogeneous objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23620","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23620","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23621","fieldValue":" Query processing in a multimedia document system is described. Multimedia documents are information objects containing formatted data, text, image, graphics, and voice. The query language is based on a conceptual document model that allows the users to formulate queries on both document content and structure. The architecture of the system is outlined, with focus on the storage organization in which both optical and magnetic devices can coexist. Query processing and the different strategies evaluated by our optimization algorithm are discussed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23621","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23621","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23622","fieldValue":" Signature files provide an efficient access method for text in documents, but retrieval is usually limited to finding documents that contain a specified Boolean pattern of words. Effective retrieval requires that documents with similar meanings be found through a process of plausible inference. The simplest way of implementing this retrieval process is to rank documents in order of their probability of relevance. In this paper techniques are described for implementing probabilistic ranking strategies with sequential and bit-sliced signature tiles and the limitations of these implementations with regard to their effectiveness are pointed out. A detailed comparison is made between signature-based ranking techniques and ranking using term-based document representatives and inverted files. The comparison shows that term-based representations are at least competitive (in terms of efficiency) with signature files and, in some situations, superior."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23622","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23622","fieldValue":"ACM"}
