{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8194","fieldValue":" Common periodical health check-ups include several clinical test items with affordable cost. However, these standard tests do not directly indicate signs of most lifestyle diseases. In order to detect such diseases, a number of additional specific clinical tests are required, which increase the cost of the health check-up. This study aims to enrich our understanding of the common health check-ups and proposes a way to estimate the signs of several lifestyle diseases based on the standard tests in common examinations without performing any additional specific tests. In this manner, we enable a diagnostic process, where the physician may prefer to perform or avoid a costly test according to the estimation carried out through a set of common affordable tests. To that end, the relation between standard and specific test results is modeled with a multivariate kernel density estimate. The condition of the patient regarding a specific test is assessed following a Bayesian framework. Our results indicate that the proposed method achieves an overall estimation accuracy of 84&percnt;. In addition, an outstanding estimation accuracy is achieved for a subset of high-cost tests. Moreover, comparison with standard artificial intelligence methods suggests that our algorithm outperforms the conventional methods. Our contributions are as follows: (i) promotion of affordable health check-ups, (ii) high estimation accuracy in certain tests, (iii) generalization capability due to ease of implementation on different platforms and institutions, (iv) flexibility to apply to various tests and potential to improve early detection rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8194","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8194","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1739","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a new cache replacement policy that makes the replacement decision based on the reuse information of the cache lines and the requested data. We present the architectural support and evaluate the performance of our approach using SPEC benchmarks. We also develop two reuse information predictors: a profile-based static predictor and a runtime predictor. The applicability of each predictor is discussed in this paper. We further extend our reuse information predictors so that the cache can adaptively choose between the reuse information based replacement policy and an approximation of LRU policy. According to the experimental results, our adaptive reuse information based replacement policy performs either better than or close to the LRU policy. Our experiments show that L2 cache misses are reduced by 12.32&percnt; and 19.95&percnt; using the profiling-based static and runtime adaptive predictors respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1739","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1739","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8195","fieldValue":" Automated monitoring algorithms operating on live video streamed from a home can effectively aid in several assistive monitoring goals, such as detecting falls or estimating daily energy expenditure. Use of video raises obvious privacy concerns. Several privacy enhancements have been proposed such as modifying a person in video by introducing blur, silhouette, or bounding-box. Person extraction is fundamental in video-based assistive monitoring and degraded in the presence of privacy enhancements; however, privacy enhancements have characteristics that can opportunistically be adapted to. We propose two adaptive algorithms for improving assistive monitoring goal performance with privacy-enhanced video: specific-color hunter and edge-void filler. A nonadaptive algorithm, foregrounding, is used as the default algorithm for the adaptive algorithms. We compare nonadaptive and adaptive algorithms with 5 common privacy enhancements on the effectiveness of 8 automated monitoring goals. The nonadaptive algorithm performance on privacy-enhanced video is degraded from raw video. However, adaptive algorithms can compensate for the degradation. Energy estimation accuracy in our tests degraded from 90.9&percnt; to 83.9&percnt;, but the adaptive algorithms significantly compensated by bringing the accuracy up to 87.1&percnt;. Similarly, fall detection accuracy degraded from 1.0 sensitivity to 0.86 and from 1.0 specificity to 0.79, but the adaptive algorithms compensated accuracy back to 0.92 sensitivity and 0.90 specificity. Additionally, the adaptive algorithms were computationally more efficient than the nonadaptive algorithm, averaging 1.7&percnt; more frames processed per second."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8195","fieldValue":"Accurate and Efficient Algorithms that Adapt to Privacy-Enhanced Video for Improved Assistive Monitoring"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8195","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8195","fieldValue":"ACM"}
