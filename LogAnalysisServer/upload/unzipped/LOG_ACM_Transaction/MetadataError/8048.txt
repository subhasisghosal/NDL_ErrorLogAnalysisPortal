However, lack of sufficient flow-level measurements as well as potential anomalies pose major challenges towards this goal. Leveraging the spatiotemporal correlation of nominal traffic, and the sparse nature of anomalies, this paper brings forth a novel framework to map out nominal and anomalous traffic, which treats jointly important network monitoring tasks including traffic estimation, anomaly detection, and traffic interpolation. To this end, a convex program is first formulated with nuclear and l1-norm regularization to effect sparsity and low rank for the nominal and anomalous traffic with only the link counts and a small subset of OD-flow counts. Analysis and simulations confirm that the proposed estimator can exactly recover sufficiently low-dimensional nominal traffic and sporadic anomalies so long as the routing paths are sufficiently \"spread-out\" across the network, and an adequate amount of flow counts are randomly sampled. The results offer valuable insights about data acquisition strategies and network scenaria giving rise to accurate traffic estimation. For practical networks where the aforementioned conditions are possibly violated, the inherent spatiotemporal traffic patterns are taken into account by adopting a Bayesian approach along with a bilinear characterization of the nuclear and $l_1$ norms. The resultant nonconvex program involves quadratic regularizers with correlation matrices, learned systematically from (cyclo)stationary historical data. Alternating-minimization based algorithms with provable convergence are also developed to procure the estimates. Insightful tests with synthetic and real Internet data corroborate the effectiveness of the novel schemes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10911","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10911","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10911","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10911","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10912","fieldValue":" Future RFID technologies will go far beyond today's widely used passive tags. Battery-powered active tags are likely to gain more popularity due to their long operational ranges and richer on-tag resources. With integrated sensors, these tags can provide not only static identification numbers but also dynamic, real-time information such as sensor readings. This paper studies a general problem of how to design efficient polling protocols to collect such real-time information from a subset of M tags in a large RFID system. We show that the standard, straightforward polling design is not energy-efficient because each tag has to continuously monitor the wireless channel and receive O(|M|) tag IDs, which is energy-consuming. Existing work is able to cut the amount of data each tag has to receive by half through a coding design. In this paper, we propose a tag-ordering polling protocol (TOP) that can reduce per-tag energy consumption by more than an order of magnitude. We also reveal an energy-time tradeoff in the protocol design: per-tag energy consumption can be reduced to O(1) at the expense of longer execution time of the protocol. We then apply partitioned Bloom filters to enhance the performance of TOP, such that it can achieve much better energy efficiency without degradation in protocol execution time. Finally, we show how to configure the new protocols for time-constrained energy minimization."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10912","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10912","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10912","fieldValue":"ACM"}
