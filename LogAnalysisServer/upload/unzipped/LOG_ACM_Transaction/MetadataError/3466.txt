{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21342","fieldValue":" As the number of applications of sensor networks increases, so does the interest in sensor network localization, that is, in recovering the correct position of each node in a network of sensors from partial connectivity information such as adjacency, range, or angle between neighboring nodes. In this article, we consider the anchor-free localization problem in sensor networks that report possibly noisy range information and angular information about the relative order of each sensor's neighbors. Previously proposed techniques seem to successfully reconstruct the original positions of the nodes for relatively small networks with nodes distributed in simple regions. However, these techniques do not scale well with network size and yield poor results with nonconvex or nonsimple underlying topology. Moreover, the distributed nature of the problem makes some of the centralized techniques inapplicable in distributed settings. To address these problems we describe a multiscale dead-reckoning (MSDR) algorithm that scales well for large networks, can reconstruct complex underlying topologies, and is resilient to noise. The MSDR algorithm takes its roots from classic force-directed graph layout computation techniques. These techniques are augmented with a multiscale extension to handle the scalability issue and with a dead-reckoning extension to overcome the problems arising with nonsimple topologies. Furthermore, we show that the distributed version of the MSDR algorithm performs as well as, if not better than, its centralized counterpart, as shown by the quality of the layout, measured in terms of the accuracy of the computed pairwise distances between sensors in the network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21342","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3034","fieldValue":" Although researchers have conducted extensive studies on relation extraction in the last decade, statistical systems based on supervised learning are still limited, because they require large amounts of training data to achieve high performance level. In this article, we propose cross-lingual annotation projection methods that leverage parallel corpora to build a relation extraction system for a resource-poor language without significant annotation efforts. To make our method more reliable, we introduce two types of projection approaches with noise reduction strategies. We demonstrate the merit of our method using a Korean relation extraction system trained on projected examples from an English-Korean parallel corpus. Experiments show the feasibility of our approaches through comparison to other systems based on monolingual resources."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3034","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3034","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21343","fieldValue":" Recent literature contains proposals for key predistribution schemes for sensor networks in which nodes are deployed in separate groups. In this article we consider the implications of group deployment for the connectivity and resilience of a key predistribution scheme. We propose a flexible scheme, based on the structure of a resolvable transversal design. We demonstrate that this scheme permits effective trade-offs between resilience, connectivity and storage requirements within a group-deployed environment as compared with other schemes in the literature, and show that group deployment can be used to increase network connectivity, without increasing storage requirements or sacrificing resilience."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21344","fieldValue":" An important class of sensor network applications aims at estimating the spatiotemporal behavior of a physical phenomenon, such as temperature variations over an area of interest. In such a scenario, the network essentially acts as a distributed sampling system. However, unlike in the event detection case, the notion of sensing range is largely meaningless for sampling-interpolation applications. As a result, existing techniques to exploit sensing redundancy in event detection settings, which rely on the existence of such sensing range, become unusable. Instead, this article presents a new method to exploit redundancy for the sampling class of applications by selecting a suitable set of sensors to act as sampling points. Through online estimation of process characteristics, sufficiently accurate interpolation can be achieved. We illustrate an algorithm to obtain multiple disjoint sets and demonstrate significant reductions in the number of active sensors for a wide range of synthetic sensor data."}
