Traditional wake-up scheduling approaches either require periodic synchronization messages or incur high packet delivery latency due to the lack of any synchronization. To simultaneously achieve the seemingly contradictory goals of energy efficiency and low latency, the design of a new low duty-cycle MAC layer protocol called Convergent MAC (CMAC) is presented. CMAC avoids synchronization overhead while supporting low latency. By using zero communication when there is no traffic, CMAC allows sensor nodes to operate at very low duty cycles. When carrying traffic, CMAC first uses anycast to wake up forwarding nodes, and then converges gradually from route-suboptimal anycast with unsynchronized duty cycling to route-optimal unicast with synchronized scheduling. To validate our design and provide a usable module for the research community, CMAC has been implemented in TinyOS and evaluated on the Kansei testbed consisting of 105 XSM nodes. The results show that CMAC at 1&percnt; duty cycle significantly outperforms BMAC at 1&percnt; in terms of latency, throughput and energy efficiency. The performance of CMAC is also compared with other protocols using simulations, in which the results show for 1&percnt; and lower duty cycles, CMAC exhibits similar throughput and latency as CSMA\/CA using much less energy, and outperforms SMAC, DMAC and GeRaF in almost all aspects."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21281","fieldValue":"CMAC"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21281","fieldValue":"MAC"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21281","fieldValue":"CMAC: An energy-efficient MAC layer protocol using convergent packet forwarding for wireless sensor networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21281","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21282","fieldValue":" We explore fundamental performance limits of tracking a target in a two-dimensional field of binary proximity sensors, and design algorithms that attain those limits while providing minimal descriptions of the estimated target trajectory. Using geometric and probabilistic analysis of an idealized model, we prove that the achievable spatial resolution in localizing a target's trajectory is of the order of 1\/Ï?R, where R is the sensing radius and Ï? is the sensor density per unit area. We provide a geometric algorithm for computing an economical (in descriptive complexity) piecewise linear path that approximates the trajectory within this fundamental limit of accuracy. We employ analogies between binary sensing and sampling theory to contend that only a â\u20ACœlowpassâ\u20AC? approximation of the trajectory is attainable, and explore the implications of this observation for estimating the target's velocity. We also consider nonideal sensing, employing particle filters to average over noisy sensor observations, and geometric geometric postprocessing of the particle filter output to provide an economical piecewise linear description of the trajectory. In addition to simulation results validating our approaches for both idealized and nonideal sensing, we report on lab-scale experiments using motes with acoustic sensors."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21282","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21282","fieldValue":"ACM"}
