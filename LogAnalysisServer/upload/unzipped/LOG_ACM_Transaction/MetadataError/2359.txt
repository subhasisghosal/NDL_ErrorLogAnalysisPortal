In this article, we present a new framework for automatically editing eyes in photographs. We leverage a userâ\u20AC™s personal photo collection to find a â\u20ACœgoodâ\u20AC? set of reference eyes and transfer them onto a target image. Our example-based editing approach is robust and effective for realistic image editing. A fully automatic pipeline for realistic eye editing is challenging due to the unconstrained conditions under which the face appears in a typical photo collection. We use crowd-sourced human evaluations to understand the aspects of the target-reference image pair that will produce the most realistic results. We subsequently train a model that automatically selects the top-ranked reference candidate(s) by narrowing the gap in terms of pose, local contrast, lighting conditions, and even expressions. Finally, we develop a comprehensive pipeline of three-dimensional face estimation, image warping, relighting, image harmonization, automatic segmentation, and image compositing in order to achieve highly believable results. We evaluate the performance of our method via quantitative and crowd-sourced experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17747","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17748","fieldValue":" We present an approach to generate plausible acoustic effects at interactive rates in large dynamic environments containing many sound sources. Our formulation combines listener-based backward ray tracing with sound source clustering and hybrid audio rendering to handle complex scenes. We present a new algorithm for dynamic late reverberation that performs high-order ray tracing from the listener against spherical sound sources. We achieve sublinear scaling with the number of sources by clustering distant sound sources and taking relative visibility into account. We also describe a hybrid convolution-based audio rendering technique that can process hundreds of thousands of sound paths at interactive rates. We demonstrate the performance on many indoor and outdoor scenes with up to 200 sound sources. In practice, our algorithm can compute more than 50 reflection orders at interactive rates on a multicore PC, and we observe a 5x speedup over prior geometric sound propagation algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17748","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2678","fieldValue":" We investigate fast algorithms for changing between the standard basis and an orthogonal basis of idempotents for MÃ¶bius algebras of finite lattices. We show that every lattice with v elements, n of which are nonzero and join-irreducible (or, by a dual result, nonzero and meet-irreducible), has arithmetic circuits of size O(vn) for computing the zeta transform and its inverse, thus enabling fast multiplication in the MÃ¶bius algebra. Furthermore, the circuit construction in fact gives optimal (up to constants) monotone circuits for several lattices of combinatorial and algebraic relevance, such as the lattice of subsets of a finite set, the lattice of set partitions of a finite set, the lattice of vector subspaces of a finite vector space, and the lattice of positive divisors of a positive integer."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/2678","fieldValue":"M&ouml;bius inversion"}
