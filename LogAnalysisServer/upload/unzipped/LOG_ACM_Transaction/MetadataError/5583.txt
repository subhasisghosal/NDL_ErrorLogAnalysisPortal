The classification performed by SCA is an essential component of the detection and analysis of various cardiac arrhythmic disorders, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Given a digitized frame of a propagating wave, SCA constructs a highly accurate representation of the front and the back of the wave, piecewise interpolates this representation with cubic splines, and subjects the result to an accurate curvature analysis. This analysis is more comprehensive than methods based on spiral-tip tracking, as it considers the entire wave front and back. To increase the smoothness of the resulting symbolic representation, the SCA uses weighted overlapping of adjacent segments which increases the smoothness at join points. SCA has been applied to a number of representative types of spiral waves, and, for each type, a distinct curvature evolution in time (signature) has been identified. Distinct signatures have also been identified for spiral breakup. These results represent a significant first step in automatically determining parameter ranges for which a computational cardiac-cell network accurately reproduces a particular kind of cardiac arrhythmia, such as ventricular fibrillation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4903","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4903","fieldValue":"Spirals,Computational modeling,Mathematical model,Graphics processing unit,Arrays,IEEE transactions,Computational biology,curvature,Spirals,Computational modeling,Mathematical model,Graphics processing unit,Arrays,IEEE transactions,Computational biology,cardiac arrhythmia and fibrillation,Cardiac excitation waves,isopotentials,B&#x00E9"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4903","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4903","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4904","fieldValue":" Modeling across multiple scales is a current challenge in Systems Biology, especially when applied to multicellular organisms. In this paper, we present an approach to model at different spatial scales, using the new concept of Hierarchically Colored Petri Nets (HCPN). We apply HCPN to model a tissue comprising multiple cells hexagonally packed in a honeycomb formation in order to describe the phenomenon of Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling in Drosophila wing. We have constructed a family of related models, permitting different hypotheses to be explored regarding the mechanisms underlying PCP. In addition our models include the effect of well-studied genetic mutations. We have applied a set of analytical techniques including clustering and model checking over time series of primary and secondary data. Our models support the interpretation of biological observations reported in the literature."}
