As such, much effort has been made in realistic modeling of plants. As the trend moves towards networked and distributed virtual environments, however, the current models are inadequate as they are not designed for progressive transmissions. In this article, we fill in this gap by proposing a progressive representation for plants based on generalized cylinders. We model the shape and thickness of branches in a plant as BÃ©zier curves, group the curves according to the similarity, and differentially code the curves to represent the plant in a compact and progressive manner. To facilitate the transmission of the plants, we quantify the visual contribution of each branch and use this weight in packet scheduling. We show the efficiency of our representations and the effectiveness of our packet scheduler through experiments over a wide area network."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3448","fieldValue":" This article provides longitudinal data for when participants learned to travel with a walking metaphor through virtual reality (VR) worlds, using interfaces that ranged from joystick-only, to linear and omnidirectional treadmills, and actual walking in VR. Three metrics were used: travel time, collisions (a measure of accuracy), and the speed profile. The time that participants required to reach asymptotic performance for traveling, and what that asymptote was, varied considerably between interfaces. In particular, when a world had tight turns (0.75 m corridors), participants who walked were more proficient than those who used a joystick to locomote and turned either physically or with a joystick, even after 10 minutes of training. The speed profile showed that this was caused by participants spending a notable percentage of the time stationary, irrespective of whether or not they frequently played computer games. The study shows how speed profiles can be used to help evaluate participants' proficiency with travel interfaces, highlights the need for training to be structured to addresses specific weaknesses in proficiency (e.g., start-stop movement), and for studies to measure and report that proficiency."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/3448","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2465780.2465785\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3448","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3448","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25345","fieldValue":" The design and implementation of a client-centered multimedia content adaptation system suitable for a mobile environment comprising of resource-constrained handheld devices or clients is described. The primary contributions of this work are: (1) the overall architecture of the client-centered content adaptation system, (2) a data-driven multi-level Hidden Markov model (HMM)-based approach to perform both video segmentation and video indexing in a single pass, and (3) the formulation and implementation of a Multiple-choice Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MMKP)-based video personalization strategy. In order to segment and index video data, a video stream is modeled at both the semantic unit level and video program level. These models are learned entirely from training data and no domain-dependent knowledge about the structure of video programs is used. This makes the system capable of handling various kinds of videos without having to manually redefine the program model. The proposed MMKP-based personalization strategy is shown to include more relevant video content in response to the client's request than the existing 0\/1 knapsack problem and fractional knapsack problem-based strategies, and is capable of satisfying multiple client-side constraints simultaneously. Experimental results on CNN news videos and Major League Soccer (MLS) videos are presented and analyzed."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25345","fieldValue":"ACM"}
