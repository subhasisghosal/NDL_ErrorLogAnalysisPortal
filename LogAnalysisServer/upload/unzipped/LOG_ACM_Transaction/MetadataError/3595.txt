However, when using traditional design methods and tools, it is difficult to estimate or analyze the performance impact of including such reconfigurable logic devices into a system design. In this work, we present a system-level framework, called Perfecto, which is able to perform rapid exploration of different reconfigurable design alternatives and to detect system performance bottlenecks. This framework is based on the popular IEEE standard system-level design language SystemC, which is supported by most EDA and ESL tools. Given an architecture model and an application model, Perfecto uses SystemC transaction-level models (TLMs) to simulate the system design alternatives automatically. Different hardware-software copartitioning, coscheduling, and placement algorithms can be embedded into the framework for analysis; thus, Perfecto can also be used to design the algorithms to be used in an operating system for reconfigurable systems. Applications to a simple illustration example and a network security system have shown how Perfecto helps a designer make intelligent partition decisions, optimize system performance, and evaluate task placements."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21703","fieldValue":"Perfecto: A systemc-based design-space exploration framework for dynamically reconfigurable architectures"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21703","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21703","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3075","fieldValue":"Na, Seung-Hoon"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3075","fieldValue":" There has been recent interest in statistical approaches to Korean morphological analysis. However, previous studies have been based mostly on generative models, including a hidden Markov model (HMM), without utilizing discriminative models such as a conditional random field (CRF). We present a two-stage discriminative approach based on CRFs for Korean morphological analysis. Similar to methods used for Chinese, we perform two disambiguation procedures based on CRFs: (1) morpheme segmentation and (2) POS tagging. In morpheme segmentation, an input sentence is segmented into sequences of morphemes, where a morpheme unit is either atomic or compound. In the POS tagging procedure, each morpheme (atomic or compound) is assigned a POS tag. Once POS tagging is complete, we carry out a post-processing of the compound morphemes, where each compound morpheme is further decomposed into atomic morphemes, which is based on pre-analyzed patterns and generalized HMMs obtained from the given tagged corpus. Experimental results show the promise of our proposed method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3075","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3075","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21704","fieldValue":"Chin, Scott Y L"}
