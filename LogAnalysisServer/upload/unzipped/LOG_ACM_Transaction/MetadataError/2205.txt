Traditionally, aerodynamics are examined through elaborate wind tunnel experiments or expensive fluid dynamics computations, and are only measured for a small number of discrete wind directions. OmniAD allows the evaluation of aerodynamic forces, such as drag and lift, for any incoming wind direction using a novel representation based on spherical harmonics. Our data-driven technique acquires the aerodynamic properties of an object simply by capturing its falling motion using a single camera. Once model parameters are estimated, OmniAD enables realistic real-time simulation of rigid bodies, such as the tumbling and gliding of leaves, without simulating the surrounding air. In addition, we propose an intuitive user interface based on OmniAD to interactively design three-dimensional kites that actually fly. Various non-traditional kites were designed to demonstrate the physical validity of our model."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/17361","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: ETH Z&#252;rich (Martin, Tobias); Disney Research Z&#252;rich (Umetani, Nobuyuki); IST Austria (Bickel, Bernd)"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17361","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17362","fieldValue":" We present a novel implicit formulation for highly viscous fluids simulated with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics SPH. Compared to explicit methods, our formulation is significantly more efficient and handles a larger range of viscosities. Differing from existing implicit formulations, our approach reconstructs the velocity field from a target velocity gradient. This gradient encodes a desired shear-rate damping and preserves the velocity divergence that is introduced by the SPH pressure solver to counteract density deviations. The target gradient ensures that pressure and viscosity computation do not interfere. Therefore, only one pressure projection step is required, which is in contrast to state-of-the-art implicit Eulerian formulations. While our model differs from true viscosity in that vorticity diffusion is not encoded in the target gradient, it nevertheless captures many of the qualitative behaviors of viscous liquids. Our formulation can easily be incorporated into complex scenarios with one- and two-way coupled solids and multiple fluid phases with different densities and viscosities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17362","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17363","fieldValue":" We present a novel method to simulate codimensional non-Newtonian fluids on simplicial complexes. Our method extends previous work for codimensional incompressible flow to various types of non-Newtonian fluids including both shear thinning and thickening, Bingham plastics, and elastoplastics. We propose a novel time integration scheme for semi-implicitly treating elasticity, which when combined with a semi-implicit method for variable viscosity alleviates the need for small time steps. Furthermore, we propose an improved treatment of viscosity on the rims of thin fluid sheets that allows us to capture their elusive, visually appealing twisting motion. In order to simulate complex phenomena such as the mixing of colored paint, we adopt a multiple level set framework and propose a discretization on simplicial complexes that facilitates the tracking of material interfaces across codimensions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by simulating a wide variety of non-Newtonian fluid phenomena exhibiting various codimensional features."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17363","fieldValue":"ACM"}
