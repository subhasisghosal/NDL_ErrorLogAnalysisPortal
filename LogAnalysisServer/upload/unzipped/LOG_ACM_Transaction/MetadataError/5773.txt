Rearrangements of genomes through operations such as reversals and transpositions are rare events that enable researchers to reconstruct deep evolutionary history among species. Some of the popular methods need to search a large tree space for the best scored tree, thus it is desirable to have a fast and accurate method that can score a given tree efficiently. During the tree scoring procedure, the genomic structures of internal tree nodes are also provided, which provide important information for inferring ancestral genomes and for modeling the evolutionary processes. However, computing tree scores and ancestral genomes are very difficult and a lot of researchers have to rely on heuristic methods which have various disadvantages. In this paper, we describe the first genetic algorithm for tree scoring and ancestor inference, which uses a fitness function considering co-evolution, adopts different initial seeding methods to initialize the first population pool, and utilizes a sorting-based approach to realize evolution. Our extensive experiments show that compared with other existing algorithms, this new method is more accurate and can infer ancestral genomes that are much closer to the true ancestors."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5257","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5257","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5257","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5258","fieldValue":" Phased haplotype information is crucial in our complete understanding of differences between individuals at the genetic level. Given a collection of DNA fragments sequenced from a homologous pair of chromosomes, the problem of single individual haplotyping (SIH) aims to reconstruct a pair of haplotypes using a computer algorithm. In this paper, we encode the information of aligned DNA fragments into a two-locus linkage graph and approach the SIH problem by vertex labeling of the graph. In order to find a vertex labeling with the minimum sum of weights of incompatible edges, we develop a fast and accurate heuristic algorithm. It starts with detecting error-tolerant components by an adapted breadth-first search. A proper labeling of vertices is then identified for each component, with which sequencing errors are further corrected and edge weights are adjusted accordingly. After contracting each error-tolerant component into a single vertex, the above procedure is iterated on the resulting condensed linkage graph until error-tolerant components are no longer detected. The algorithm finally outputs a haplotype pair based on the vertex labeling. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data show that our algorithm is more accurate and faster than five existing algorithms for single individual haplotyping."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5258","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5258","fieldValue":"LGH: A Fast and Accurate Algorithm for Single Individual Haplotyping Based on a Two-Locus Linkage Graph"}
