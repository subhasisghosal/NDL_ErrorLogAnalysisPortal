{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11120","fieldValue":" This special issue includes the first set of articles addressing broadening participation in computing education. The articles span the stages of the pipeline, from introducing middle school children to computer science to retaining underrepresented groups at the university level. The preface presented here outlines the need for increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities, women, and people with disabilities in the development of technology. In addition, the preface summarizes the six articles included in this first (of two) issues on broadening participation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11120","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11120","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11121","fieldValue":" If we are to attract more women and minorities to computing we must engage students at an early age. As part of its mission to increase participation of women and underrepresented minorities in computing, the Increasing Student Participation in Research Development Program (INSPIRED) conducts computing academies for high school students. The academies are designed to increase studentsâ\u20AC™ knowledge of and interest in computing and to encourage females and minorities to participate in computing. INSPIRED academies differ from others in several ways. They are relatively easy to organize and require relatively few resources; they focus on computing concepts and object-oriented programming; they expose students to successful female and minority computer scientists; and they actively engage university students from underrepresented groups to organize, coordinate, teach, and help assess the academies. This not only provides role models for the high school students but also helps engage the university students and promote their professional development. Our assessment results show that high school student participants have gained significant knowledge and interest in computing through participation in the academies. This article describes the organization, coordination, content, and assessment of the academies, along with suggestions for those who would like to design academies like these. It also discusses how to prepare university students for their roles in the academies and how their participation has helped in their professional development. It includes pointers to sites from which the instructional and assessment materials can be downloaded for those who wish to replicate or adapt these materials."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11121","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11121","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11122","fieldValue":"Kim, Karen A"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11122","fieldValue":"Fann, Amy J"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11122","fieldValue":"Misa-Escalante, Kimberly O"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11122","fieldValue":" Building on research that identifies and addresses issues of womenâ\u20AC™s underrepresentation in computing, this article describes promising practices in undergraduate research experiences that promote womenâ\u20AC™s long-term interest in computer science and engineering. Specifically, this article explores whether and how REU programs include programmatic elements designed to promote gender equity and identifies specific mechanisms that are seen as effective in supporting women in REU programs and in encouraging them to persist in computer science and engineering fields. The findings are drawn from a comprehensive study that includes a national survey of REU programs, follow-up interviews with REU program directors from across the country, and an in-depth evaluation of one REU program over four years."}
