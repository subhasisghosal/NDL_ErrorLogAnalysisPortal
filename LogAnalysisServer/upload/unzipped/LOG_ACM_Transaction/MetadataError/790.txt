However, identification of the longest testable paths requires high CPU time, and the sensitization of all such paths leads to large pattern counts. Dynamic test compaction for small-delay defects is therefore necessary to reduce test-data volume. We present a new technique for identifying the longest testable paths through each gate in order to accelerate test generation for SDDs. The resulting test patterns sensitize the longest testable paths that pass through each SDD site. An efficient dynamic test compaction method based on structural analysis is presented to reduce the pattern count substantially, while ensuring that all the longest paths for each SDD are sensitized. Simulation results for a set of ISCAS 89 and IWLS 05 benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of this method."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13338","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13339","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13340","fieldValue":" Reducing energy consumption in multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) where communication happens via the network-on-chip (NoC) approach calls for multiple voltage\/frequency island (VFI)-based designs. In turn, such multi-VFI architectures need efficient, robust, and accurate runtime control mechanisms that can exploit the workload characteristics in order to save power. Despite being tractable, the linear control models for power management cannot capture some important workload characteristics (e.g., fractality, nonstationarity) observed in heterogeneous NoCs; if ignored, such characteristics lead to inefficient communication and resources allocation, as well as high power dissipation in MPSoCs. To mitigate such limitations, we propose a new paradigm shift from power optimization based on linear models to control approaches based on fractal-state equations. As such, our approach is the first to propose a controller for fractal workloads with precise constraints on state and control variables and specific time bounds. Our results show that significant power savings can be achieved at runtime while running a variety of benchmark applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13340","fieldValue":"ACM"}
