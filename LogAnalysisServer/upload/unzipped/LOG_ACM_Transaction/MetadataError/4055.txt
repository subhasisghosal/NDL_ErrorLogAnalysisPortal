FLORA presents grade-level text passages to children, who read the passages out loud, and computes the number of words correct per minute (WCPM), a standard measure of oral reading fluency. We describe the main components of the FLORA program, including the system architecture and the speech recognition subsystems. We compare results of FLORA to human scoring on 783 recordings of grade level text passages read aloud by first through fourth grade students in classroom settings. On average, FLORA WCPM scores were within 3 to 4 words of human scorers across students in different grade levels and schools."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23063","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23063","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23064","fieldValue":" We present a novel system to automatically diagnose reading disorders. The system is based on a speech recognition engine with a module for prosodic analysis. The reading disorder test is based on eight different subtests. In each of the subtests, the system achieves a recognition accuracy of at least 95&percnt;. As in the perceptual version of the test, the results of the subtests are then joined into a final test result to determine whether the child has a reading disorder. In the final classification stage, the system identifies 98.3&percnt; of the 120 children correctly. In the future, our system will facilitate the clinical evaluation of reading disorders."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23064","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23064","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23065","fieldValue":"Buchenroth-Martin, Cindy"}
