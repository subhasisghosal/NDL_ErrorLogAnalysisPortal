These theorems were recently generalized to other logics, which led to new applications in descriptive complexity and database theory. However, a logical characterization of local properties that correspond to Hanf's and Gaifman's theorems is still lacking. Such a characterization only exists for structures of bounded valence. In this paper, we give logical characterizations of local properties behind Hanf's and Gaifman's theorems. We first deal with an infinitary logic with counting terms and quantifiers that is known to capture Hanf-locality on structures of bounded valence. We show that testing isomorphism of neighborhoods can be added to it without violating Hanf-locality, while increasing its expressive power. We then show that adding local second-order quantification to it caputures precisely all Hanf-local properties. To capture Gaifman-locality, one must also add a (potentially infinite) case statement. We further show that the hierarchy based on the number of variants in the case statement is strict."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11351","fieldValue":" In software verification it is often required to prove statements about heterogeneous domains containing elements of various sorts, such as counters, stacks, lists, trees and queues. Any domain with counters, stacks, lists, and trees (but not queues) can be easily seen a special case of the term algebra, and hence a decision procedure for term algebras can be applied to decide the first-order theory of such a domain. We present a quantifier-elimination procedure for the first-order theory of term algebra extended with queues. The complete axiomatization and decidability of this theory can be immediately derived from the procedure."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11351","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11352","fieldValue":" We present a bottom-up decision procedure for propositional modal logic K based on the inverse method.

We introduce a new technique of proving redundancy criteria, based on the analysis of tableau-based derivations in K. Moreover, another new technique is based on so-called traces. A new search with a strong notion of subsumption. This technique is based on so-called traces. A new formalization of the inverse method in the form of a path calculus considerably simplifies all proofs as compared to the previously published presentations of the inverse method. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is competitive with many state-of-the-art implementations of K."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11352","fieldValue":"How to optimize proof-search in modal logics: new methods of proving redundancy criteria for sequent calculi"}
