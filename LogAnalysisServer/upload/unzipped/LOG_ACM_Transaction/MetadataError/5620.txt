Prominent examples are revision histories of documents or genomic sequences. Modern high-throughput sequencing technologies are able to generate DNA sequences at an ever-increasing rate. In parallel to the decreasing experimental time and cost necessary to produce DNA sequences, computational requirements for analysis and storage of the sequences are steeply increasing. Compression is a key technology to deal with this challenge. Recently, referential compression schemes, storing only the differences between a to-be-compressed input and a known reference sequence, gained a lot of interest in this field. In this paper, we propose a general open-source framework to compress large amounts of biological sequence data called Framework for REferential Sequence COmpression (FRESCO). Our basic compression algorithm is shown to be one to two orders of magnitudes faster than comparable related work, while achieving similar compression ratios. We also propose several techniques to further increase compression ratios, while still retaining the advantage in speed: 1) selecting a good reference sequence; and 2) rewriting a reference sequence to allow for better compression. In addition, we propose a new way of further boosting the compression ratios by applying referential compression to already referentially compressed files (second-order compression). This technique allows for compression ratios way beyond state of the art, for instance, 4,000:1 and higher for human genomes. We evaluate our algorithms on a large data set from three different species (more than 1,000 genomes, more than 3 TB) and on a collection of versions of Wikipedia pages. Our results show that real-time compression of highly similar sequences at high compression ratios is possible on modern hardware."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4966","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4966","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4966","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1424","fieldValue":" The increasing permeation of technology in our society leads to the challenge that everybody needs to interact with technology systems. Older adults often meet difficulties while trying to interact with complex, demanding systems in their daily life. One approach to enable older adults to use new technologies in a safe and efficient way is the provision of training programs. In this article we report about a promising training strategy using video modeling in conjunction with other instructional methods to enhance learning. Cognitive as well as socio-motivational aspects will be addressed. We assessed if guided error training in video modeling will improve learning outcomes for a Ticket Vending Machine (TVM). To investigate if the training method might be beneficial for younger adults as well, we compared 40 younger and 40 older adult learners in a guided error training course with error-free training. Younger and older participants made fewer mistakes in guided error training, but no differences occurred in task completion times. Moreover, self-efficacy increased with training for both age groups, but no significant differences were found for the training condition. Analysis of knowledge gains showed a significant benefit of guided error training in structural knowledge. Overall, the results showed that guided error training may enhance learning for younger and older adults who are learning to use technology."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1424","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1424","fieldValue":"ACM"}
