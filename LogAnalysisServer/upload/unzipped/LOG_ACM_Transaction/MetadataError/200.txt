In this article, we prove that certain game-theoretic security properties, including balance for contract-signing protocols, can be decided in a Dolev-Yao style model with a bounded number of sessions. The decision algorithm that we develop is based on standard constraint-solving procedures, which, in the past, have successfully been employed in tools for reachability properties. Our result thus paves the way for extending these tools to deal with game-theoretic security properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11579","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11580","fieldValue":" We studyâ\u20AC\u201Dwithin the framework of propositional proof complexityâ\u20AC\u201Dthe problem of certifying unsatisfiability of CNF formulas under the promise that any satisfiable formula has many satisfying assignments, where many stands for an explicitly specified function Î\u203A in the number of variables n. To this end, we develop propositional proof systems under different measures of promises (i.e., different Î\u203A) as extensions of resolution. This is done by augmenting resolution with axioms that, roughly, can eliminate sets of truth assignments defined by Boolean circuits. We then investigate the complexity of such systems, obtaining an exponential separation in the average case between resolution under different size promises: (1) Resolution has polynomial-size refutations for all unsatisfiable 3CNF formulas when the promise is $&epsis;á¹¡2^n, for any constant 0"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11580","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11580","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11581","fieldValue":"Ben-Sasson, Eli"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11581","fieldValue":" We present a simple proof of the bounded-depth Frege proof lower bounds of Pitassi et al.

Our lower bound is conceptually simpler than previous ones, and relies on tools and intuition that are well known in the context of computational complexity. This makes the lower bound of Pitassi et al. [1993] and KrajÃ­Ä?ek et al. [1995] accessible to the general computational complexity audience.
