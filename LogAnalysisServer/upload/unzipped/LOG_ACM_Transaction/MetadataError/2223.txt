The case of this problem on polygonal obstacles is well studied. In this article, we consider the problem version on curved obstacles, which are commonly modeled as splinegons. A splinegon can be viewed as replacing each edge of a polygon by a convex curved edge (polygons are special splinegons), and the combinatorial complexity of each curved edge is assumed to be O(1). Given in the plane two points s and t and a set s of h pairwise disjoint splinegons with a total of n vertices, after a bounded degree decomposition of S is obtained, we compute a shortest s-to-t path avoiding the splinegons in O(n &plus; hâ\u20AC\u2030logâ\u20AC\u2030h &plus; k) time, where k is a parameter sensitive to the geometric structures of the input and is upper bounded by $O(h^2). The bounded degree decomposition of S, which is similar to the triangulation of the polygonal domains, can be computed in O(nâ\u20AC\u2030logâ\u20AC\u2030n) time or O(n &plus; hâ\u20AC\u2030logâ\u20AC\u20301 &plus; &epsi;h) time for any &epsi; > 0. In particular, when all splinegons are convex, the decomposition can be computed in O(n &plus; hâ\u20AC\u2030logâ\u20AC\u2030h) time and k is linear to the number of common tangents in the free space (called â\u20ACœfree common tangentsâ\u20AC?) among the splinegons. Our techniques also improve several previous results: (1) For the polygon case (i.e., when all splinegons are polygons), the shortest path problem was previously solved in O(nâ\u20AC\u2030logâ\u20AC\u2030n) time, or in O(n &plus; h2logâ\u20AC\u2030n) time. Thus, our algorithm improves the O(n &plus; h2logâ\u20AC\u2030n) time result, and is faster than the O(nâ\u20AC\u2030logâ\u20AC\u2030n) time solution for sufficiently small h, for example, h=o(&sqrt;n,logn. (2) Our techniques produce an optimal output-sensitive algorithm for a basic visibility problem of computing all free common tangents among h pairwise disjoint convex splinegons with a total of n vertices. Our algorithm runs in O(n &plus; hâ\u20AC\u2030logâ\u20AC\u2030h &plus; k) time and O(n) working space, where k is the number of all free common tangents. Note that k &equals; O(h2). Even for the special case where all splinegons are convex polygons, the previously best algorithm for this visibility problem takes O(n &plus; h2$logâ\u20AC\u2030n) time. (3) We improve the previous work for computing the shortest path between two points among convex pseudodisks of O(1) complexity each. In addition, a by-product of our techniques is an optimal O(n &plus; hâ\u20AC\u2030logâ\u20AC\u2030h) time and O(n) space algorithm for computing the Voronoi diagram of a set of h pairwise disjoint convex splinegons with a total of n vertices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2646","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2646","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17407","fieldValue":"Cohen-Or, Daniel"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17407","fieldValue":" Decomposing a complex shape into geometrically simple primitives is a fundamental problem in geometry processing. We are interested in a shape decomposition problem where the simple primitives sought are generalized cylinders, which are ubiquitous in both organic forms and man-made artifacts. We introduce a quantitative measure of cylindricity for a shape part and develop a cylindricity-driven optimization algorithm, with a global objective function, for generalized cylinder decomposition. As a measure of geometric simplicity and following the minimum description length principle, cylindricity is defined as the cost of representing a cylinder through skeletal and cross-section profile curves. Our decomposition algorithm progressively builds local to non-local cylinders, which form over-complete covers of the input shape. The over-completeness of the cylinder covers ensures a conservative buildup of the cylindrical parts, leaving the final decision on decomposition to global optimization. We solve the global optimization by finding an exact cover, which optimizes the global objective function. We demonstrate results of our optimal decomposition algorithm on numerous examples and compare with other alternatives."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17408","fieldValue":" We study the design and optimization of polyhedral patterns, which are patterns of planar polygonal faces on freeform surfaces. Working with polyhedral patterns is desirable in architectural geometry and industrial design. However, the classical tiling patterns on the plane must take on various shapes in order to faithfully and feasibly approximate curved surfaces. We define and analyze the deformations these tiles must undertake to account for curvature, and discover the symmetries that remain invariant under such deformations. We propose a novel method to regularize polyhedral patterns while maintaining these symmetries into a plethora of aesthetic and feasible patterns."}
