Analysis and simulations show that allocating bandwidth in this fashion can significantly improve the user-perceived delay, bit transmission delay, and throughput over traditional approaches, e.g., by 58% on an 80% loaded linear network. A simple implementation based on TCP Reno, exemplifies how one might approach practically realizing such gains. We discuss several other advantages of incorporating such differentiation at the transport level. In particular we make the case that favoring small transfers combined with user impatience or peak rate constraints, both of which are natural mechanisms for users to express the utility of completing transfers, offers a lightweight approach to achieving good overall network goodput and\/or utility for best effort networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9304","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9304","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9304","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9305","fieldValue":" In this paper we consider a class of loss networks that have arbitrary topologies and routes of arbitrary length. Multiple traffic classes are present, each with different bandwidth requirement, and each routed according to a state-dependent routing scheme. In particular, we consider the least loaded routing method generalized to routes of arbitrary number of hops. The connection level performance metric of interest is the end-to-end blocking probability. We are interested in developing fast evaluation methods to provide reasonably accurate estimates of the blocking probability, especially under heavy traffic load. Our algorithms are based on the fixed-point method framework, also known as the reduced load approximation. In addition to what commonly examined by previous work, two more factors contribute to the complexity of the computation in the scenario under consideration in this paper. One is the state-dependent nature of the routing mechanism, the other is the possible overlapping between routes due to the general multihop topology of the network. We present two fast approximation algorithms to evaluate the blocking probability with state-dependent routing by simplifying the route overlapping computation. We discuss the computational complexity of our algorithms as well as sources of approximation error. We then compare the numerical results with that of simulation and show that our algorithms provide fairly accurate blocking probability estimates especially under heavy traffic load."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9305","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9305","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9306","fieldValue":"Hartline, Jeff R K"}
