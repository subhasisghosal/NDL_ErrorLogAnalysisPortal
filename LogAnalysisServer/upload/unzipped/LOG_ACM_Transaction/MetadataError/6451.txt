People today consume information and services on the go, through smart phones applications capable of exploiting their location in order to adapt the content according to the context of use. As location-based services gain traction and reveal their limitations, we argue there is a need for intelligent systems to be created to better support people's activities in their experience of the city, especially regarding their decision-making processes. In this article, we explore the opportunity to move closer to the realization of the ubiquitous computing vision by turning physical places into smart environments capable of cooperatively and autonomously collecting, processing, and transporting information about their characteristics (e.g., practical information, presence of people, and ambience). Following a multidisciplinary approach which leverages psychology, design, and computer science, we propose to investigate the potential of building communication and interaction spaces, called information spheres, on top of physical places such as businesses, homes, and institutions. We argue that, if the latter are exposed on the Web, they can act as a platform delivering information and services and mediating interactions with smart objects without requiring too much effort for the deployment of the architecture. After presenting the inherent challenges of our vision, we go through the protocol of two preliminary experiments that aim to evaluate users' perception of different types of information (i.e., reviews, check-in information, video streams, and real-time representations) and their influence on the decision-making process. Results of this study lead us to elaborate the design considerations that must be taken into account to ensure the intelligibility and user acceptance of information spheres. We finally describe a research prototype application called Environment Browser (Env-B) and present the underlying smart space middleware, before evaluating the user experience with our system through quantitative and qualitative methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7167","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7168","fieldValue":"Garde-Perik, Evelien van de"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7168","fieldValue":"Boerdonk, Koen van"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7168","fieldValue":"Lenssen, Kars-Michiel"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7168","fieldValue":"Hoven, Elise van den"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7168","fieldValue":" This article focuses on the conceptual relation between the user's input and a system's output in interaction with smart tangible objects. Understanding this input-output relation (IO relation) is a prerequisite for the design of meaningful interaction. A meaningful IO relation allows the user to know what to do with a system to achieve a certain goal and to evaluate the outcome. The work discussed in this article followed a design research process in which four concepts were developed and prototyped. An evaluation was performed using these prototypes to investigate the effect of highly different IO relations on the user's understanding of the interaction. The evaluation revealed two types of IO relations differing in functionality and the number of mappings between the user and system actions. These two types of relations are described by two IO models that provide an overview of these mappings. Furthermore, they illustrate the role of the user and the influence of the system in the process of understanding the interaction. The analysis of the two types of IO models illustrates the value of understanding IO relations for the design of smart tangible objects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7168","fieldValue":"ACM"}
