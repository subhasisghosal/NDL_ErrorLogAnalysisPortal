We investigated interactive health interest profiles (HIPs) that summarize health-related terms extracted from usersâ\u20AC™ community posts. Through iterative design, we explored practical designs that accommodate differences in usersâ\u20AC™ community participation in three HIP prototypes: Text, Word Cloud, and Timeline. By comparing prototype usability with patients and design experts, we found that patients accurately used each prototype but completed some tasks faster with the Timeline HIP. Despite this advantage, patients preferred the Text HIP. Design experts and patients agreed that simple data overviews and granular details with salient cues that invite interactivity are key design considerations for HIPs. Findings offer key design considerations for HIPs that patients find most useful when forging critical connections."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5936","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5936","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5937","fieldValue":" The Slide and Canvas metaphors are two ways of helping people create visual aids for oral presentations. Although such physical metaphors help both authors and audiences make sense of material, they also constrain authoring in ways that can negatively impact presentation delivery. In this article, we derive heuristics for the design of presentation media that are independent of any underlying physical metaphors. We use these heuristics to craft a new kind of presentation medium called SlideSpaceâ\u20AC\u201Done that combines hierarchical outlines, content collections, and design rules to automate the real-time, outline-driven synthesis of hybrid Slide-Canvas visuals. Through a qualitative study of SlideSpace use, we validate our heuristics and demonstrate that such a hybrid presentation medium can combine the advantages of existing systems while mitigating their drawbacks. Overall, we show how a heuristic design approach helped us challenge entrenched physical metaphors to create a fundamentally digital presentation medium with the potential to transform the activities of authoring, delivering, and viewing presentations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5938","fieldValue":" The purpose of pitch correction is to assist a musician in playing notes with accuracy and precision, without preventing expressive pitch variations. This study presents and examines a new method for automatic pitch correction: Dynamic Pitch Warping (DPW). The analytic formulation of the warping function is derived. In the context of live playing of continuous pitch trajectories, the dynamics of pitch correction must be considered. Methods for triggering and releasing the correction are discussed, and a performance test is conducted. DPW is evaluated in the context of digital musical instruments that are controlled by a stylus on a graphic tablet. The results show significant improvement in note accuracy and precision with the addition of the correction method. Analyses of various types of modulations (including vibrato, portamento, and glissando) demonstrate that expressive pitch variations are preserved by the DPW correction. Perceptual tests show that the effects of DPW correction are well perceived and positively assessed by listeners. The proposed method allows for accurate pitch target acquisition together with preservation of expressive motion, a result that could be extended to other situations that require dynamic trajectory correction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5938","fieldValue":"ACM"}
