{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21347","fieldValue":" Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are envisioned for a number of application scenarios. Nevertheless, the few in-the-field experiences typically focus on the features of a specific system, and rarely report about the characteristics of the target environment, especially with respect to the behavior and performance of low-power wireless communication. The TRITon project, funded by our local administration, aims to improve safety and reduce maintenance costs of road tunnels, using a WSN-based control infrastructure. The access to real tunnels within TRITon gives us the opportunity to experimentally assess the peculiarities of this environment, hitherto not investigated in the WSN field. We report about three deployments: (i) an operational road tunnel, enabling us to assess the impact of vehicular traffic; (ii) a nonoperational tunnel, providing insights into analogous scenarios (e.g., underground mines) without vehicles; (iii) a vineyard, serving as a baseline representative of the existing literature. Our setup, replicated in each deployment, uses mainstream WSN hardware, and popular MAC and routing protocols. We analyze and compare the deployments with respect to reliability, stability, and asymmetry of links, the accuracy of link quality estimators, and the impact of these aspects on MAC and routing layers. Our analysis shows that a number of criteria commonly used in the design of WSN protocols do not hold in tunnels. Therefore, our results are useful for designing networking solutions operating efficiently in similar environments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21347","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21348","fieldValue":"apkun, Srdjan"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21348","fieldValue":" An integral part of most security- and safety-critical applications is a dependable and timely alarm notification. However, owing to the resource constraints of wireless sensor nodes (i.e., their limited power and spectral diversity), ensuring a timely and jamming-resistant delivery of alarm messages in applications that rely on wireless sensor networks is a challenging task. With current alarm forwarding schemes, blocking of an alarm by jamming is straightforward and jamming is very likely to remain unnoticed. In this work, we propose a novel jamming detection scheme as a solution to this problem. Our scheme is able to identify the cause of bit errors for individual packets by looking at the received signal strength during the reception of these bits and is well-suited for the protection of reactive alarm systems with very low network traffic. We present three different techniques for the identification of bit errors based on: predetermined knowledge, error correcting codes, and limited node wiring. We perform a detailed evaluation of the proposed solution and validate our findings experimentally with Chipcon CC1000 radios. The results show that our solution effectively detects sophisticated jamming attacks that cannot be detected with existing techniques and enables the formation of robust sensor networks for dependable delivery of alarm notifications. Our scheme also meets the high demands on the energy efficiency of reactive surveillance applications as it can operate without introducing additional wireless network traffic."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21348","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21348","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21349","fieldValue":" We seek to detect statistically significant temporal or spatial changes in either the underlying process the sensor network is monitoring or in the network operation itself. These changes may point to faults, adversarial threats, misbehavior, or other anomalies that require intervention. To that end, we introduce a new statistical anomaly detection framework that uses Markov models to characterize the â\u20ACœnormalâ\u20AC? behavior of the sensor network. We develop a series of Markov models, including tree-indexed Markov chains which can model its spatial structure. For each model, an anomaly-free probability law is estimated from past traces. We leverage large deviations techniques to develop optimal anomaly detection rules for each corresponding Markov model, assessing whether its most recent empirical measure is consistent with the anomaly-free probability law. A series of simulation results, some with real sensor data, validate the effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21349","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21349","fieldValue":"ACM"}
