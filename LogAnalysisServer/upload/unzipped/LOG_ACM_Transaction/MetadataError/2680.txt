Previous smoothing techniques and class-based and similarity-based models could not handle the dynamic status perfectly. In this paper, an adaptive learning algorithm is proposed for task adaptation that best fits the runtime application domain in applying Chinese homophone disambiguation. The proposed algorithm is first formulated by a neural network model and then generalized to avoid the problem of slow convergence. The resulting techniques are greatly simplified and robust. The experimental results demonstrate the effects of the learning algorithm from a generic domain to a specific one. A methodology is also presented to show how these techniques can be extended to various language models and corpus-based applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2834","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2834","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18960","fieldValue":" A method is described for the eignevalues of piecewise smooth C2 extremum-energy curves.

However, the corresponding memory requirement is proportional to the run-time of the evaluation program. Therefore, the practical applicability of the reverse mode in its original formulation is limited despite the availability of ever larger memory systems. This observation leads to the development of checkpointing schedules to reduce the storage requirements. This article presents the function revolve, which generates checkpointing schedules that are provably optimal with regard to a primary and a secondary criterion. This routine is intended to be used as an explicit â\u20ACœcontrollerâ\u20AC? for running a time-dependent applications program."}
