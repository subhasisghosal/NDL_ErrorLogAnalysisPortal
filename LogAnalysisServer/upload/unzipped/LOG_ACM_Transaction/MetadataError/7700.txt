This new Ethernet is refereed to as Carrier Ethernet. Among the various transport infrastructures for realizing Carrier Ethernet, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical network is a strong candidate for this purpose. Optical transmission rates per channel are increasing from 10 to 40 Gb\/s and even 100 Gb\/s, and they can also coexist in the same fiber. Along with the flexibility associated with such a network with mixed-line rates (MLR), signal-related constraints at high rates become a challenge for cost-efficient routing. Among these issues is the maximum nonregenerated optical distance that a signal can travel before its quality degrades or maximum transmission range (TR). TR is rate-dependent: The higher the rate, the shorter the range. While high-rate pipes may require signal regeneration to restore the signal's quality, they support more traffic and, hence, can save resources. We study the problem of cost-efficient routing of multi-bit-rate (1\/10\/40\/100 Gb\/s) Ethernet tunnels using MLR over a carrier's WDM optical network with signal-transmission-range constraints. We studied the effect of TR for mixed-rate signals (10\/40\/100 Gb\/s) on the network's cost to determine the optimal TR of each bit rate. We present an analytical model based on a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to determine the optimal TR of a small network. Since MILP has scalability constraints that makes it hard or sometimes impossible to solve for real network topologies, we propose a graph-based solution that constructs a mixed-line-rate auxiliary (MLR-AUX) graph to capture the network's heterogeneity and a weight-assignment approach that allows the routing to be cost-efficient. Our algorithms were tested on a U.S. nationwide network topology. We found that it is possible to reduce the network's cost by using short TR and that the optimal TR depends strongly on traffic characteristics and on the TR values of different bit-rate signals."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10211","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10211","fieldValue":"On routing and transmission-range determination of multi-bit-rate signals over mixed-line-rate WDM optical networks for carrier ethernet"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10211","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10211","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10212","fieldValue":" To guarantee the streaming quality in live peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming channels, it is preferable to provision adequate levels of upload capacities at dedicated streaming servers, compensating for peer instability and time-varying peer upload bandwidth availability. Most commercial P2P streaming systems have resorted to the practice of overprovisioning a fixed amount of upload capacity on streaming servers. In this paper, we have performed a detailed analysis on 10 months of run-time traces from UUSee, a commercial P2P streaming system, and observed that available server capacities are not able to keep up with the increasing demand by hundreds of channels. We propose a novel online server capacity provisioning algorithm that proactively adjusts server capacities available to each of the concurrent channels, such that the supply of server bandwidth in each channel dynamically adapts to the forecasted demand, taking into account the number of peers, the streaming quality, and the channel priority. The algorithm is able to learn over time, has full Internet service provider (ISP) awareness to maximally constrain P2P traffic within ISP boundaries, and can provide differentiated streaming qualities to different channels by manipulating their priorities. To evaluate its effectiveness, our experiments are based on an implementation of the algorithm, which replays real-world traces."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10212","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10212","fieldValue":"ACM"}
