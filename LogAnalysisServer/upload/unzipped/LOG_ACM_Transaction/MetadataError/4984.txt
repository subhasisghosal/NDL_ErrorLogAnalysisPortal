In these systems, the beams are steered in various directions to investigate a given portion of space. The band can be so wide as to require both superdirective performance (to increase directivity at low frequencies) and sparse aperiodic layouts (to avoid grating lobes at high frequencies). We propose an original method to simultaneously optimize the transducer positions and the coefficients of the Finite Impulse Response FIR filters, providing a solution that maintains its validity for whatever steering direction inside a predefined region of interest. A hybrid strategy, analytical for the coefficients and stochastic for the positions, is devised to minimize the beam pattern (BP) energy while maintaining an unaltered signal from the steering direction and controlling the side lobes. The robustness of the superdirectivity is achieved by taking into account the probability density functions for the characteristics of realistic transducers. A distinctive feature of our method is its ability to maintain the computational tractability of the addressed optimization problem by drastically reducing the burden of evaluating the cost function. The obtained results, addressing tens of transducers and several octaves of band, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of directivity, contrast, and robustness."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3641","fieldValue":"Design of superdirective planar arrays with sparse aperiodic layouts for processing broadband signals via 3-D beamforming"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3641","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3641","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3642","fieldValue":"Davies, Matthew E P"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3642","fieldValue":" A recent trend in the field of beat tracking for musical audio signals has been to explore techniques for measuring the level of agreement and disagreement between a committee of beat tracking algorithms. By using beat tracking evaluation methods to compare all pairwise combinations of beat tracker outputs, it has been shown that selecting the beat tracker which most agrees with the remainder of the committee, on a song-by-song basis, leads to improved performance which surpasses the accuracy of any individual beat tracker used on its own. In this paper we extend this idea towards presenting a single, standalone beat tracking solution which can exploit the benefit ofmutual agreement without the need to run multiple separate beat tracking algorithms. In contrast to existing work, we re-cast the problem as one of selecting between the beat outputs resulting from a single beat tracking model with multiple, diverse input features. Through extended evaluation on a large annotated database, we show that our multi-feature beat tracker can outperform the state of the art, and thereby demonstrate that there is sufficient diversity in input features for beat tracking, without the need for multiple tracking models."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3642","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3642","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3643","fieldValue":"Wang, DeLiang"}
