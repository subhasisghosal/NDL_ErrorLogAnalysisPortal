We study here the combined problem of scheduling and power control, where we seek both an assignment of power settings and a partition of the links so that each set satisfies the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) constraints. We give an algorithm that attains an approximation ratio of O(log n Ä\u2039 log log Î\u201D), where n is the number of links and Î\u201D is the ratio between the longest and the shortest link length. Under the natural assumption that lengths are represented in binary, this gives the first approximation ratio that is polylogarithmic in the size of the input. The algorithm has the desirable property of using an oblivious power assignment, where the power assigned to a sender depends only on the length of the link. We give evidence that this dependence on Î\u201D is unavoidable, showing that any reasonably behaving oblivious power assignment results in a Î©(log log Î\u201D)-approximation. These results hold also for the (weighted) capacity problem of finding a maximum (weighted) subset of links that can be scheduled in a single time slot. In addition, we obtain improved approximation for a bidirectional variant of the scheduling problem, give partial answers to questions about the utility of graphs for modeling physical interference, and generalize the setting from the standard 2-dimensional Euclidean plane to doubling metrics. Finally, we explore the utility of graph models in capturing wireless interference."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2568","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2568","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16540","fieldValue":" We present a method for the global parametrization of meshes that preserves alignment to a cross field in input while obtaining a parametric domain made of few coarse axis-aligned rectangular patches, which form an abstract base complex without T-junctions.

In contrast to the surface cross-frame field (equivalent to a 4-Way Rotational-Symmetry vector field), symmetry for 3D cross-frame fields cannot be formulated by simple one-parameter 2D rotations in the tangent planes. To address this critical issue, we represent the 3D frames by spherical harmonics, in a manner invariant to combinations of rotations around any axis by multiples of Ï\u20AC\/2. With such a representation, we can formulate an efficient smoothness measure of the cross-frame field. Through minimization of this measure under certain boundary conditions, we can construct a smooth 3D cross-frame field that is aligned with the surface normal at the boundary. We visualize the resulting cross-frame field through restrictions to the boundary surface, streamline tracing in the volume, and singularities. We also demonstrate the application of the 3D cross-frame field to producing hexahedron-dominant meshes for given volumes, and discuss its potential in high-quality hexahedralization, much as its 2D counterpart has shown in quadrangulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16541","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16541","fieldValue":"ACM"}
