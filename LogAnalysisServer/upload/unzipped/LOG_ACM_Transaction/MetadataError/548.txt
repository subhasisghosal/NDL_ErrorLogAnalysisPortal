In this work, we present a CoDesign methodology based on a formal approach to embedded system specification. This methodology uses the Templated T-LOTOS language to specify the system during all design phases. Templated T-LOTOS is a formal language based on CCS and CSP models. Using Templated T-LOTOS, a system can be specified by observing the temporal ordering in which the events occur from the outside. In this paper we focus on the synthesis of system specified by Templated T-LOTOS. The proposed synthesis algorithm takes advantage of peculiarities of Templates T-LOTOS. Hardware modules are translated into a register transfer-level language that manages some signals in order to drive synchronization, while the software models are translated into C according to a finite state model whose operations are controlled by a scheduler. The synthesis of the Templated T-LOTOS specification is based on the direct translation of the language operators to ensure that the implemented system is the same as the specified one."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12776","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12777","fieldValue":"Chang, Yao-Wen"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12777","fieldValue":" In this paper we present a timing-driven router for symmetrical array-based FPGAs. The routing resources in the FPGAs consist of segments of various lengths. Researchers have shown that the number of segments, instead of wirelength, used by a net is the most critical factor in controlling routing delay in an FPGA. Thus, the traditional measure of routing delay on the basis of geometric distance of a signal is not accurate. To consider wirelength and delay simultaneously, we study a model of timing-driven routing rees, arising from the special properties of FPGA routing architectures. Based on the solutions to the routing-tree problem, we present a routing algorithm that is able to utilize various routing segments with global considerations to meet timing constraints. Experimental results show that our approach is very effective in reducing timing violations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12777","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12777","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12778","fieldValue":" Forward estimates of area and delay facilitate effective decision-making when searching the solution space of digital designs. Current estimation techniques focus on modeling the layout result and fail to deliver timely or accurate estimates. This paper presents a novel approach to deriving these area and delay estimates at the RTL level by modeling the layout tool, rather than the layout result. This approach uses machine learning techniques to capture the relationships between general design features (i.e., topology, connectivity, common input, and common output) and layout concepts (i.e., relative placement). Experiments illustrate the formulation of the training set for machine learning in this domain, and also show how we can derive different tool models. Finally, they show how we can use the resultant model to derive forward estimates of area and delay in real-world designs."}
