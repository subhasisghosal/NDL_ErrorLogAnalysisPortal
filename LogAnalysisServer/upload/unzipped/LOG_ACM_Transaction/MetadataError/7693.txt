It has been employed in diverse situations, for instance, when: 1) the global network topology is not known or is highly dynamic; 2) the availability of the next-hop neighbors is not easily controllable; or 3) the relaying nodes are computationally constrained. Data delivery in sensor networks, ad hoc networks, and delay-tolerant networks are well-known applications besides searching in peer-to-peer networks. A major challenge for stateless opportunistic forwarding is the difficulty to predict the end-to-end latency. To facilitate latency evaluation, we study a simplified model of stateless opportunistic forwarding, namely a \"weighted random walk\" in a finite graph. This paper makes several contributions toward the analysis of this model. 1) By spectral graph theory we derive a general formula to efficiently compute the exact hitting and commute times of random walks with heterogeneous transition times at relay nodes. Such transition times can model the heterogeneous delivery times and availability periods of the next-hop neighbors. 2) We study a common class of distance-regular networks with a varying number of geographical neighbors and obtain exact and approximation formulas for the hitting time in such networks. 3) Based on these results, we study other sophisticated settings, such as random geographical locations, topology-aware forwarding, and multicopy random-walk forwarding. Our results provide the basic analytical tools for managing and controlling the performance of stateless opportunistic forwarding in finite networks."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10197","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10197","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10197","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10198","fieldValue":" This paper studies the problem of congestion control and scheduling in ad hoc wireless networks that have to support a mixture of best-effort and real-time traffic. Optimization and stochastic network theory have been successful in designing architectures for fair resource allocation to meet long-term throughput demands. However, to the best of our knowledge, strict packet delay deadlines were not considered in this framework previously. In this paper, we propose a model for incorporating the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of packets with deadlines in the optimization framework. The solution to the problem results in a joint congestion control and scheduling algorithm that fairly allocates resources to meet the fairness objectives of both elastic and inelastic flows and per-packet delay requirements of inelastic flows."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10198","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10198","fieldValue":"Optimal scheduling for fair resource allocation in ad hoc networks with elastic and inelastic traffic"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10198","fieldValue":"ACM"}
