For general directed and undirected graphs we give an O(log D)-approximation algorithm, where D is the sum of demands, and prove matching Î©(log D) hardness results assuming P â\u2030  NP. For undirected trees, we give an exact algorithm and show how this can be combined with a result of RÃ¤cke to give a solution that exceeds edge capacities by at most $O(log^2$ n log log n), where n is the number of nodes. For undirected graphs of bounded treewidth we show that the problem is still NP-hard, but we are able to give a PTAS with at most (1 + &epsis;) violation of the capacities for arbitrarily small &epsis;, or a (k+1) approximation with exact capacities, where k is the treewidth."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2407","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14929","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14929","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14930","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14931","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14931","fieldValue":"ACM"}
