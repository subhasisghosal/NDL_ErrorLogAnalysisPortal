An analysis of YouTube reveals a high amount of redundancy, in the form of videos with overlapping or duplicated content. We use robust content-based video analysis techniques to detect overlapping sequences between videos. Based on the output of these techniques, we present an in-depth study of duplication and content overlap in YouTube, and analyze various dependencies between content overlap and meta data such as video titles, views, video ratings, and tags. As an application, we show that content-based links provide useful information for generating new tag assignments. We propose different tag propagation methods for automatically obtaining richer video annotations. Experiments on video clustering and classification as well as a user evaluation demonstrate the viability of our approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24032","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3335","fieldValue":" A nonisotropic hybrid image\/model-based gaze-contingent rendering technique utilizing ray casting on a GPU is discussed. Empirical evidence derived from human subject experiments indicates an inverse relationship between a peripherally degraded scene's high-resolution inset size and mean search time, a trend consistent with existing image-based and model-based techniques. In addition, the data suggest that maintaining a target's silhouette edges decreases search times when compared to targets with degraded edges. However, analysis suggests a point of diminishing returns with an inset larger than 15Â° when target discrimination is a component of visual search. Benefits of the hybrid technique include simplicity of design and parallelizability, both conducive to GPU implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3335","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3335","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24033","fieldValue":" This article comprehensively addresses the problem of similarity measurement between music artists via text-based features extracted from Web pages. To this end, we present a thorough evaluation of different term-weighting strategies, normalization methods, aggregation functions, and similarity measurement techniques. In large-scale genre classification experiments carried out on real-world artist collections, we analyze several thousand combinations of settings\/parameters that influence the similarity calculation process, and investigate in which way they impact the quality of the similarity estimates. Accurate similarity measures for music are vital for many applications, such as automated playlist generation, music recommender systems, music information systems, or intelligent user interfaces to access music collections by means beyond text-based browsing. Therefore, by exhaustively analyzing the potential of text-based features derived from artist-related Web pages, this article constitutes an important contribution to context-based music information research."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24033","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24034","fieldValue":"Lau, Raymond YK"}
