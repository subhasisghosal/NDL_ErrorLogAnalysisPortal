{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16043","fieldValue":" Full spectra allow the generation of a physically correct rendering of a scene under different lighting conditions. In this article we devise a tool to augment a palette of given lights and material reflectances with constructed spectra, yielding specified colors or spectral properties such as metamerism or objective color constancy. We utilize this to emphasize or hide parts of a scene by matching or differentiating colors under different illuminations. These color criteria are expressed as a quadratic programming problem, which may be solved with positivity constraints. Further, we characterize full spectra of lights, surfaces, and transmissive materials in an efficient linear subspace model by forming eigenvectors of sets of spectra and transform them to an intermediate space in which spectral interactions reduce to simple component-wise multiplications during rendering. The proposed method enhances the user's freedom in designing photo-realistic scenes and helps in creating expressive visualizations. A key application of our technique is to use specific spectral lighting to scale the visual complexity of a scene by controlling visibility of texture details in surface graphics or material details in volume rendering."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16043","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16044","fieldValue":" Computing correspondence between time frames of a time-dependent 3D surface is essential for the understanding of its motion and deformation. In particular, it can be a useful tool in compression, editing, texturing, or analysis of the physical or structural properties of deforming objects. However, correspondence information is not trivial to obtain for experimentally acquired 3D animations, such as time-dependent visual hulls (typically represented as either a binary occupancy grid or as a sequence of meshes of varying connectivity). In this article we present a new nonrigid fitting method that can compute such correspondence information for objects that do not undergo large volume or topological changes, such as living creatures. Experimental results show that it is robust enough to handle visual hull data, allowing to convert it into a constant connectivity mesh with vertices moving in time. Our procedure first creates a rest-state mesh from one of the input frames. This rest-state mesh is then fitted to the consecutive frames. We do this by iteratively displacing its vertices so that a combination of surface distance and elastic potential energy is minimized. A novel rotation compensation method enables us to obtain high-quality results with linear elasticity, even in presence of significant bending."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16044","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16045","fieldValue":" Light traveling through semi-transparent media such as smoke and marble is absorbed and scattered. To achieve proper realistic visualizations of such media, illumination algorithms must account for these events. In this article, we present a new method for solving the Radiative Transport Equation, which models such evolution of light. The new method falls into the category of the Discrete Ordinates Method and inherits its generality and computational lightness. This method is known to suffer from two main shortcomings, namely false scattering and the ray effect, which we avoid in our new method. By propagating the light using low-dimensional maps of rays we detach their transport from the Eulerian grid and use fine angular discretizations. Thus, the scattering effect at each scattering generation is eliminated and the ray effect is significantly reduced at no additional memory requirements. Results demonstrate the new method's efficiency, ability to produce high-quality approximations, and its usefulness for a wide range of computer graphics applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16045","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1017","fieldValue":" An approximation paradigm is proposed for logic programming as a simple modification to a complete evaluation strategy. The motivational example illustrates how a straigthforward transformation of a declarative specification of the distance between two vertices in a directed graph leads to sophisticated algorithms for computing shortest paths. The goal of the work presented in this paper is not to provide a more efficient computation of shortest paths but to investigate how the intermediate tables, known as extension tables, generated by the complete evaluation strategy might be used in approximation algorithms. We present the ETdistance algorithm in perspective, its execution is compared to those of Dijkstra's single-source and Floyd's all-pairs shortest path algorithms."}
