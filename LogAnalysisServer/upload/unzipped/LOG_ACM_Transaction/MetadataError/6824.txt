Over the last dozen years about 200 million taxpayer dollars have gone into funding many of these CAEs, with millions explicitly targeted to help them build capacity. The most visible intended output has been in the form of around 125 Scholarship for Service (SFS) students per year going mostly into the workforce of the federal government. Surely the output capacity of these 181 colleges and universities is greater than that, and should be helping to protect the rest of US citizens and taxpayers. We take a need-based look at what the nationâ\u20AC™s workforce should look like, and then consider some possibilities of what the CAE schools could be doing to help to close the gaps between that perceived need and the supply and demand."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8208","fieldValue":"Bisset, Keith R"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8208","fieldValue":"Marathe, Madhav V"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8208","fieldValue":" We present an integrated interactive modeling environment to support public health epidemiology. The environment combines a high resolution individual-based model with a user-friendly Web-based interface that allows analysts to access the models and the analytics backend remotely from a desktop or a mobile device. The environment is based on a loosely coupled service-oriented-architecture that allows analysts to explore various counterfactual scenarios. As the modeling tools for public health epidemiology are getting more sophisticated, it is becoming increasingly difficult for noncomputational scientists to effectively use the systems that incorporate such models. Thus an important design consideration for an integrated modeling environment is to improve ease of use such that experimental simulations can be driven by the users. This is achieved by designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that allow users to design and analyze a computational experiment and steer the experiment based on the state of the system. A key feature of a system that supports this design goal is the ability to start, stop, pause, and roll back the disease propagation and intervention application process interactively. An analyst can access the state of the system at any point in time and formulate dynamic interventions based on additional information obtained through state assessment. In addition, the environment provides automated services for experiment set-up and management, thus reducing the overall time for conducting end-to-end experimental studies. We illustrate the applicability of the system by describing computational experiments based on realistic pandemic planning scenarios. The experiments are designed to demonstrate the systemâ\u20AC™s capability and enhanced user productivity."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8208","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8208","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8209","fieldValue":"St Louis, Connie"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8209","fieldValue":" The need to improve population monitoring and enhance surveillance of infectious diseases has never been more pressing. Factors such as air travel act as a catalyst in the spread of new and existing viruses. The unprecedented user-generated activity on social networks over the last few years has created real-time streams of personal data that provide an invaluable tool for monitoring and sampling large populations. Epidemic intelligence relies on constant monitoring of online media sources for early warning, detection, and rapid response; however, the real-time information available in social networks provides a new paradigm for the early warning function. The communication of risk in any public health emergency is a complex task for governments and healthcare agencies. This task is made more challenging in the current situation when the public has access to a wide range of online resources, ranging from traditional news channels to information posted on blogs and social networks. Twitterâ\u20AC™s strength is its two-way communication nature --- both as an information source but also as a central hub for publishing, disseminating and discovering online media. This study addresses these two challenges by investigating the role of Twitter during the 2009 swine flu pandemic by analysing data collected from the SN, and by Twitter using the opposite way for dissemination information through the network. First, we demonstrate the role of the social network for early warning by detecting an upcoming spike in an epidemic before the official surveillance systems by up to two weeks in the U.K. and up to two to three weeks in the U.S. Second, we illustrate how online resources are propagated through Twitter at the time of the WHOâ\u20AC™s declaration of the swine flu â\u20ACœpandemicâ\u20AC?. Our findings indicate that Twitter does favour reputable t bogus information can still leak into the network."}
