We study the computational properties of less demanding set-valued solution concepts that are based on varying notions of dominance. These concepts are intuitively appealing, always exist, and admit unique minimal solutions in important subclasses of games. Examples include Shapleyâ\u20AC™s saddles, Harsanyi and Seltenâ\u20AC™s primitive formations, Basu and Weibullâ\u20AC™s CURB sets, and Dutta and Laslierâ\u20AC™s minimal covering set. Based on a unifying framework proposed by Duggan and Le Breton, we formulate two generic algorithms for computing these concepts and investigate for which classes of games and which properties of the underlying dominance notion the algorithms are sound and efficient. We identify two sets of conditions that are sufficient for polynomial-time computability and show that the conditions are satisfied, for instance, by saddles and primitive formations in normal-form games, minimal CURB sets in two-player games, and the minimal covering set in symmetric matrix games. Our positive algorithmic results explain regularities observed in the literature, but also apply to several solution concepts whose computational complexity was previously unknown."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/6082","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: University of Oxford, Oxford, UK (Brill, Markus); Technische Universit&#228;t M&#252;nchen, Germany (Brandt, Felix)"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/6082","fieldValue":"Shapley&rsquo;s saddles"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6082","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6082","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6083","fieldValue":" In this article, we study infinitely repeated games in settings of imperfect monitoring. We first prove a family of theorems showing that when the signals observed by the players satisfy a condition known as (&epsi;, Î³)-differential privacy, the folk theorem has little bite: for values of &epsi; and Î³ sufficiently small, for a fixed discount factor, any equilibrium of the repeated game involves players playing approximate equilibria of the stage game in every period. Next we argue that in large games (n player games in which unilateral deviations by single players have only a small impact on the utility of other players), many monitoring settings naturally lead to signals that satisfy (&epsi;, Î³)-differential privacy for &epsi; and Î³ tending to zero as the number of players n grows large. We conclude that in such settings, the set of equilibria of the repeated game collapses to the set of equilibria of the stage game. Our results nest and generalize previous results of Green [1980] and Sabourian [1990], suggesting that differential privacy is a natural measure of the â\u20ACœlargenessâ\u20AC? of a game. Further, techniques from the literature on differential privacy allow us to prove quantitative bounds, where the existing literature focuses on limiting results."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.editor","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6084","fieldValue":"Chen, Jian-Jia"}
