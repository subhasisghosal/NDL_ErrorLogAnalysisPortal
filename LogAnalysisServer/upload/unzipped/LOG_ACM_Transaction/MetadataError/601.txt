Synthesis produces net-lists of analog components that are selected from a library, and sized so that specified objectives (like AC response, signal to noise ratio, dynamic range, area) are optimized. The gap between abstract specifications and implementations is bridged using a two-layered methodology. The first layer is architecture generation. The second layer is component synthesis and constraint transformation. Architecture generation employs the branch-and-bound algorithm to create architectural alternatives for a system. Component synthesis and constraint transformation use a directed interval based genetic algorithm that operates on parameter ranges. The performance estimation engine embeds technology process parameters, SPICE models for basic circuits, and symbolic composition equations for basic structural configurations. The paper discusses the VHDL-AMS subset for synthesis. The subset offers the composition semantics. As a result, specifications offer sufficient insight into the system structure to allow automated architecture generation. To justify the flexibility of the methodology, the paper presents results for three case studies, a signal conditioning system, a filter, and an analog to digital converter. Experiments show that constraint-satisfying designs can be synthesized in a short time, at a low cost, and without requesting broad knowledge on analog circuits."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12904","fieldValue":"VHDL-AMS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12904","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12904","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12905","fieldValue":"Editorial"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12905","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12905","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12906","fieldValue":" In this article, we study the technology mapping problem for a novel field-programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture that is based on k-input single-output programmable logic array- (PLA-) like cells, or, k\/m-macrocells. Each cell in this architecture can implement a single output function of up to k inputs and up to m product terms. We develop a very efficient technology mapping algorithm, k&lowbar;m&lowbar;flow, for this new type of architecture. The experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve depth-optimality on almost all the testcases in a set of 16 Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) benchmarks. Furthermore it is shown that on this set of benchmarks, with only a relatively small number of product terms (m â\u2030¤ k &plus; 3), the k\/m-macrocell-based FPGAs can achieve the same or similar mapping depth compared with the traditional k-input single-output lookup table- (k-LUT-) based FPGAs. We also investigate the total area and delay of k\/m-macrocell-based FPGAs and compare them with those of the commonly used 4-LUT-based FPGAs. The experimental results show that k\/m-macrocell-based FPGAs can outperform 4-LUT-based FPGAs in terms of both delay and area after placement and routing by VPR on this set of benchmarks."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12906","fieldValue":"CPLD"}
