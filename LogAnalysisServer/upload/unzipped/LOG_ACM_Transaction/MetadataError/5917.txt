{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5709","fieldValue":" We describe the two-year-long development and evaluation of the Proportionality Method, a design method intended to aid HCI practitioners in designing advanced IT applications with complex privacy implications. The method is inspired by Data Protection Authorities' (DPA) and Courts' practice and proposes to balance the impact on privacy of IT applications with their usefulness. We discuss the results of an evaluation of the design method to verify its usability, usefulness and effectiveness vis-Ã -vis other design methods proposed in the HCI literature to address similar issues. Results suggest that different design methods for privacy highlight different sets of issues and a combination of methods should be employed in a comprehensive design process. We propose to judge design methods based on their overall quantitative and qualitative merits, including the type of application and technology for which they are most fit and their methodological approach. We finally propose to develop a privacy toolbox, that is, a set of heuristic methods that designers can choose from with knowledge and understanding of their relative advantages and limitations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5709","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5709","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5710","fieldValue":" In this article, we examine the containment of clutter in family homes and, from this, outline considerations for design. Selected materials from an ethnographically informed study of home life are used to detail the ways in which families contain their clutter in bowls and drawers. Clutter, within these containers, is found to be made up of a heterogeneous collection of things that, for all manner of reasons, hold an ambiguous status in the home. It is shown that bowls and drawers provide a â\u20ACœsafeâ\u20AC? site of containment for clutter, giving the miscellany of content the â\u20ACœspaceâ\u20AC? to be properly dealt with and classified, or to be left unresolved. The shared but idiosyncratic practices families use to contain their clutter are seen to be one of the ways in which the home, or at least the idea of home, is collectively produced. It is also part of the means by which families come to make their homes distinct and unique. These findings are used to consider what it might mean to design for the home, and to do so in ways that are sensitive to the idiosyncratic systems of household organization. In conclusion, thought is given to how we design for people's ideas of home, and how we might build sites of uncertainty into homes, where physical as well as digital things might coalesce."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5710","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1479","fieldValue":" The ability to use the movements of the eyes to write is extremely important for individuals with a severe motor disability. With eye typing, a virtual keyboard is shown on the screen and the user enters text by gazing at the intended keys one at a time. With dwell-based eye typing, a key is selected by continuously gazing at it for a specific amount of time. However, this approach has two possible drawbacks: unwanted selections and slow typing rates. In this study, we propose a dwell-free eye typing technique that filters out unintentionally selected letters from the sequence of letters looked at by the user. It ranks possible words based on their length and frequency of use and suggests them to the user. We evaluated Filteryedping with a series of experiments. First, we recruited participants without disabilities to compare it with another potential dwell-free technique and with a dwell-based eye typing interface. The results indicate it is a fast technique that allows an average of 15.95 words per minute after 100min of typing. Then, we improved the technique through iterative design and evaluation with individuals who have severe motor disabilities. This phase helped to identify and create parameters that allow the technique to be adapted to different users."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1479","fieldValue":"ALS"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1479","fieldValue":"DMD"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1479","fieldValue":"ACM"}
