We assume that the underlying channel is a Markov modulated erasure channel that is i.i.d. across users, but can be correlated in time. We characterize the system throughput asymptotically in n. Specifically, we explicitly show how the throughput behaves for different values of the coding block size K as a function of n, as n. â\u2020\u2019 âˆž. For finite values of K and n, under the more restrictive assumption of Gilbert-Elliott erasure channels, we are able to provide a lower bound on the maximum achievable throughput. Using simulations, we show the tightness of the bound with respect to system parameters n and K and find that its performance is significantly better than the previously known lower bounds."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10733","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10733","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10733","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10734","fieldValue":" In many modern networks, such as datacenters, optical networks, and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), the delivery of a traffic flow with a certain bandwidth demand over a single network path is either not possible or not cost-effective. In these cases, it is very often possible to improve the network's bandwidth utilization by splitting the traffic flow over multiple efficient paths. While using multiple paths for the same traffic flow increases the efficiency of the network, it consumes expensive forwarding resources from the network nodes, such as TCAM entries of Ethernet\/MPLS switches and wavelengths\/lightpaths of optical switches. In this paper, we define several problems related to splitting a traffic flow over multiple paths while minimizing the consumption of forwarding resources, and present efficient algorithms for solving these problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10734","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10734","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10735","fieldValue":" We consider virtualization of network capacity in 802.11 WLANs and mesh networks. We show that allocating total airtime slices to ISPs is analogous to allocating a fraction of available time-slots in TDMA. We establish that the max-min fair flow rate allocation within an ISP airtime slice can be characterized independently of the rate allocation policy employed in other slices. Building on these observations, we present a lightweight, distributed algorithm for allocating airtime slices among ISP and max-min fair flow rates within each slice."}
