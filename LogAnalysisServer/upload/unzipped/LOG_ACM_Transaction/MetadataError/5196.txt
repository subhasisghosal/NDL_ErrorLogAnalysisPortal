{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4187","fieldValue":" We describe an algorithm for comparing two RNA secondary structures coded in the form of trees that introduces two new operations, called node fusion and edge fusion, besides the tree edit operations of deletion, insertion, and relabeling classically used in the literature. This allows us to address some serious limitations of the more traditional tree edit operations when the trees represent RNAs and what is searched for is a common structural core of two RNAs. Although the algorithm complexity has an exponential term, this term depends only on the number of successive fusions that may be applied to a same node, not on the total number of fusions. The algorithm remains therefore efficient in practice and is used for illustrative purposes on ribosomal as well as on other types of RNAs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4187","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4187","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4188","fieldValue":" The problem of reconstructing the duplication history of a set of tandemly repeated sequences was first introduced by Fitch [4]. Many recent studies deal with this problem, showing the validity of the unequal recombination model proposed by Fitch, describing numerous inference algorithms, and exploring the combinatorial properties of these new mathematical objects, which are duplication trees. In this paper, we deal with the topological rearrangement of these trees. Classical rearrangements used in phylogeny (NNI, SPR, TBR, ...) cannot be applied directly on duplication trees. We show that restricting the neighborhood defined by the SPR (Subtree Pruning and Regrafting) rearrangement to valid duplication trees, allows exploring the whole duplication tree space. We use these restricted rearrangements in a local search method which improves an initial tree via successive rearrangements. This method is applied to the optimization of parsimony and minimum evolution criteria. We show through simulations that this method improves all existing programs for both reconstructing the topology of the true tree and recovering its duplication events. We apply this approach to tandemly repeated human Zinc finger genes and observe that a much better duplication tree is obtained by our method than using any other program."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4188","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4188","fieldValue":"Index Terms- Tandem duplication trees, phylogeny, topological rearrangements, local search, parsimony, minimum evolution, Zinc finger genes."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4188","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4188","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4189","fieldValue":" We present a framework for improving local protein alignment algorithms. Specifically, we discuss how to extend local protein aligners to use a collection of vector seeds or ungapped alignment seeds to reduce noise hits. We model picking a set of seed models as an integer programming problem and give algorithms to choose such a set of seeds. While the problem is NP-hard, and Quasi-NP-hard to approximate to within a logarithmic factor, it can be solved easily in practice. A good set of seeds we have chosen allows four to five times fewer false positive hits, while preserving essentially identical sensitivity as BLASTP."}
