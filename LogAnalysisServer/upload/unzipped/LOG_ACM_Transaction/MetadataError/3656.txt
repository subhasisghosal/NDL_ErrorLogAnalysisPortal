This process puts tremendous pressure on designers of embedded systems for security-or reliability-critical applications. Eventual design problems not detected during design time can lead to lost money, confidentiality, or even loss of life in extreme cases. Therefore it is of vital importance to evaluate a new system for its robustness against intentionally and random induced operational faults. Currently this is generally done using extensive simulation runs using gate-level models or direct measurements on the finished silicon product. These approaches either need a significant amount of time and computational power for these simulations or rely on existing product samples. This article presents a novel system evaluation platform using power emulation and fault injection techniques to provide an additional tool for developers of embedded systems in security-and reliability-critical fields. Faults are emulated using state-of-the-art fault injection methods and a flexible pattern representation approach. The resulting effects of these faults on the power consumption profile are estimated using state-of-the-art power emulation hardware. A modular system augmentation approach provides emulation flexibility similar to fault simulation implementations. The platform enables the efficient evaluation of new hardware or software implementations of critical security or reliability solutions at an early development phase."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21821","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21821","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21822","fieldValue":"Nunez-Yanez, Jose Luis"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21822","fieldValue":" Power is an important issue limiting the applicability of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) since it is considered to be up to one order of magnitude higher than in ASICs. Recently, dynamic reconfiguration in FPGAs has emerged as a viable technique able to achieve power and cost reductions by time-multiplexing the required functionality at runtime. In this article, the applicability of Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) to FPGAs is considered together with dynamic reconfiguration of logic and clock management resources to further improve the power profile of these devices. AVS is a popular power-saving technique in ASICs that enables a device to regulate its own voltage and frequency based on workload, fabrication, and operating conditions. The resulting processing platform exploits the available application-dependent timing margins to achieve a power reduction up to 85&percnt; operating at 0.58 volts compared with operating at a nominal voltage of 1 volt. The results also show that the energy requirements at 0.58 volts are aproximately five times lower compared with nominal voltage and this can be explained by the approximate cubic relation of static energy with voltage and the fact that the static component dominates power consumption in the considered FPGA devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21822","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21822","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/21823","fieldValue":"George, Alan D"}
