Multiresolution and topographic classification are used to detect the iris center. The eye corner is calculated combining valley detection and eyelid curve extraction. The algorithm is tested in the BioID database and in a proprietary database containing more than 1200 images. The results show that the suggested algorithm is robust and accurate. Regarding the iris center our method obtains the best average behavior for the BioID database compared to other available algorithms. Additional contributions are that our algorithm functions in real time and does not require complex post processing stages."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25508","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25509","fieldValue":" There have been not many interactions between the two dominant forms of mass communication: television and the Internet, while nowadays the appearance of Internet television makes them more closely. Different with traditional TV in a passive mode of transmission, Internet TV makes it more possible to make personalized service recommendation because of the interactivity between users and the Internet. In this article, we introduce a scheme to provide targeted ad recommendation to Internet TV users by exploiting the content relevance and social relevance. First, we annotate TV videos in terms of visual content analysis and textual analysis by aligning visual and textual information. Second, with user-user, video-video and user-video relationships, we employ Multi-Relationship based Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (MRPMF) to learn representative tags for modeling user preference. And then semantic content relevance (between product\/ad and TV video) and social relevance (between product\/ad and user interest) are calculated by projecting the corresponding tags into our advertising concept space. Finally, with relevancy scores we make ranking for relevant product\/ads to effectively provide users personalized recommendation. The experimental results demonstrate attractiveness and effectiveness of our proposed approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25509","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25510","fieldValue":" In order to leverage the use of various modalities such as audio-visual materials in instilling effective learning behavior we present an intuitive approach of annotation based hapto-audio-visual interaction with the traditional digital learning materials such as e-books. By integrating the home entertainment system in the user's reading experience combined with haptic interfaces we want to examine whether such augmentation of modalities influence the user's learning patterns. The proposed Haptic E--Book (HE-Book) system leverages the haptic jacket, haptic arm band as well as haptic sofa interfaces to receive haptic emotive signals wirelessly in the form of patterned vibrations of the actuators and expresses the learning material by incorporating image, video, 3D environment based augmented display in order to pave ways for intimate reading experience in the popular mobile e-book platform."}
