{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16762","fieldValue":" The creation of free-form vector drawings has been greatly improved in recent years with techniques based on (bi)-harmonic interpolation. Such methods offer the best trade-off between sparsity (keeping the number of control points small) and expressivity (achieving complex shapes and gradients). In this paper, we introduce a vectorial solver for the computation of free-form vector gradients. Based on Finite Element Methods (FEM), its key feature is to output a low-level vector representation suitable for very fast GPU accelerated rasterization and close-form evaluation. This intermediate representation is hidden from the user: it is dynamically updated using FEM during drawing when control points are edited. Since it is output-insensitive, our approach enables novel possibilities for (bi)-harmonic vector drawings such as instancing, layering, deformation, texture and environment mapping. Finally, in this paper we also generalize and extend the set of drawing possibilities. In particular, we show how to locally control vector gradients."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16762","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/16763","fieldValue":"Bazin, Jean-Charles"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16763","fieldValue":" Effective communication using current video conferencing systems is severely hindered by the lack of eye contact caused by the disparity between the locations of the subject and the camera. While this problem has been partially solved for high-end expensive video conferencing systems, it has not been convincingly solved for consumer-level setups. We present a gaze correction approach based on a single Kinect sensor that preserves both the integrity and expressiveness of the face as well as the fidelity of the scene as a whole, producing nearly artifact-free imagery. Our method is suitable for mainstream home video conferencing: it uses inexpensive consumer hardware, achieves real-time performance and requires just a simple and short setup. Our approach is based on the observation that for our application it is sufficient to synthesize only the corrected face. Thus we render a gaze-corrected 3D model of the scene and, with the aid of a face tracker, transfer the gaze-corrected facial portion in a seamless manner onto the original image."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16763","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16763","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2589","fieldValue":" In STOCâ\u20AC™95, Arya et al. [1995] showed that for any set of n points in $R^d, a (1 + Îµ)-spanner with diameter at most 2 (respectively, 3) and O(n log n) edges (respectively, O(n log log n) edges) can be built in O(n log n) time. Moreover, it was shown in Arya et al. [1995] and Narasimhan and Smid [2007] that for any k â\u2030¥ 4, one can build in O(n(log $n)2kÎ±_k(n)) time a (1 + Îµ)-spanner with diameter at most 2k and O(n2kÎ±k(n)) edges. The function Î±k is the inverse of a certain function at the k\/2 th level of the primitive recursive hierarchy, where Î±0(n) = n\/2 , Î±1(n) = âˆšn , Î±2(n) = log n , Î±3(n) = log log n , Î±4(n) = log* n, Î±5(n) = 12 log* n , ..., etc. It is also known [Narasimhan and Smid 2007] that if one allows quadratic time, then these bounds can be improved. Specifically, for any kâ\u20AC\u2030â\u2030¥â\u20AC\u20304, a (1â\u20AC\u2030+â\u20AC\u2030Îµ)-spanner with diameter at most k and O(nkÎ±k(n)) edges can be constructed in O(n2$) time [Narasimhan and Smid 2007]. A major open question in this area is whether one can construct within time O(n log nâ\u20AC\u2030+â\u20AC\u2030nkÎ±k(n)) a (1â\u20AC\u2030+â\u20AC\u2030Îµ)-spanner with diameter at most k and O(nkÎ±k(n)) edges. In this article, we answer this question in the affirmative. Moreover, in fact, we provide a stronger result. Specifically, we show that for any kâ\u20AC\u2030â\u2030¥â\u20AC\u20304, a (1â\u20AC\u2030+â\u20AC\u2030Îµ)-spanner with diameter at most k and O(nÎ±k$(n)) edges can be built in optimal time O(n log n)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2589","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2589","fieldValue":"ACM"}
