We study how to allocate the maximal allowable transmission delay at each node, such that the amount of information collected at the sink is maximized and the total delay for the data aggregation is within the given bound. We formulate the problem by using dynamic programming and propose an optimal algorithm for the optimal assignment of transmission attempts. Based on the analysis of the optimal solution, we propose a distributed greedy algorithm. It is shown to have a similar performance as the optimal one."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21326","fieldValue":"CSMA\/CA"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21326","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21327","fieldValue":" The process of determining the physical locations of nodes in a wireless sensor network is known as localization. Self-localization is critical for large-scale sensor networks, because manual or assisted localization is often impractical due to time requirements, economic constraints, or inherent limitations of the deployment scenarios. We propose scalable solutions for reliably localizing wireless sensor networks in environments conducive to several types of ranging errors. We follow a hybrid hardware-software approach for acoustic ranging or radio interferometry to acquire internode distance measurements, and a resilient self-localization algorithm to compute the node location estimates. The acoustic ranging method improves on previous work, extending the practical measurement range up to 35 m in grassy outdoor environments, achieving a distance-invariant median measurement error of about 1&percnt; (33 cm). The localization algorithm is based on least-squares scaling with soft constraints. Empirical evaluation using ranging results obtained from sensor network field experiments and simulations confirms that our approach is more resilient than multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithms against large-magnitude ranging errors and sparse range measurements: conditions that are common in large-scale outdoor sensor network deployments."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21327","fieldValue":"MDS"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21327","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/21327","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/21328","fieldValue":" Unlike traditional multihop forwarding among stationary sensor nodes, use of mobile devices for data collection in wireless sensor networks has recently been gathering more attention. The use of mobility significantly reduces the energy consumption at sensor nodes, elongating the functional lifetime of the network. However, a drawback is an increased data delivery latency. Reducing the latency through optimizing the motion of data mules is critical for this approach to thrive. In this article, we focus on the problem of motion planning, specifically, determination of the speed of the data mule and the scheduling of the communication tasks with the sensors. We consider three models of mobility capability of the data mule to accommodate different types of vehicles. Under each mobility model, we design optimal and heuristic algorithms for different problems: single data mule case, single data mule with periodic data generation case, and multiple data mules case. We compare the performance of the heuristic algorithm with a naive algorithm and also with the multihop forwarding approach by numerical experiments. We also compare one of the optimal algorithms with a previously proposed method to see how our algorithm improves the performance and is also useful in practice. As far as we know, this study is the first of a kind that provides a systematic understanding of the motion planning problem of data mules."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/21328","fieldValue":"ACM"}
