{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9568","fieldValue":" Presented herein is a scalable framework for estimating path blocking probabilities in optical burst switched (OBS) networks where limited wavelength conversion is possible. Although presented under the guise of OBS, it is pertinent to a broader class of optical networks based on the principle of bufferless unacknowledged switching. By applying the framework to the NSFNET topology, it is shown that even the most limited conversion range may reduce path blocking probabilities by several orders of magnitude, compared with no wavelength conversion. Moreover, contrary to previous results derived for all-optical non-OBS networks with acknowledgement, OBS with full wavelength conversion achieves significantly lower blocking probabilities than OBS with limited wavelength conversion when the conversion range is small. Underpinning the framework is a generalization of the classical reduced load approximation. Assuming links evolve independently of each other allows decoupling of the network into its constituent links. A set of fixed-point equations describing the evolution of each conversion range are then solved by successive substitution to estimate link blocking probabilities. Having these link blocking probabilities, path blocking probabilities are evaluated. The complexity of the framework is dominated by the wavelength conversion range and is independent of the number of wavelengths per link under certain symmetry conditions. Both just-in-time (JIT) and just-enough-time (JET) scheduling are considered. Simulations are implemented to corroborate the accuracy of the framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9568","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9568","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9568","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9569","fieldValue":"Liu, K J R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9569","fieldValue":" In secure group communications, the time cost associated with key updates in the events of member join and departure is an important aspect of quality of service, especially in large groups with highly dynamic membership. To achieve better time efficiency, we propose a join-exit-tree (JET) key management framework. First, a special key tree topology with join and exit subtrees is introduced to handle key updates for dynamic membership. Then, optimization techniques are employed to determine the capacities of join and exit subtrees for achieving the best time efficiency, and algorithms are designed to dynamically update the join and exit trees. We show that, on average, the asymptotic time cost for each member join\/departure event is reduced to O(log (log n)) from the previous cost of O(log n), where n is the group size. Our experimental results based on simulated user activities as well as the real MBone data demonstrate that the proposed JET scheme can significantly improve the time efficiency, while maintaining low communication and computation cost, of tree-based contributory key management."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9569","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9569","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9569","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9570","fieldValue":"Lin, Wen-Dar"}
