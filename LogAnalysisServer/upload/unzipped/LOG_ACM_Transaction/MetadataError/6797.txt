Yet, effective use of that information to inform and drive business operations is a challenge. Our industry-university collaborative project draws from a rich dataset of commercial demographics, transaction history, product features, and Service Quality Index (SQI) factors on shipping transactions at FedEx. We apply inductive methods to understand and predict customer churn in a noncontractual setting. Results identify several SQI variables as important determinants of churn across a variety of analytic approaches. Building on this we propose the design of a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard as an innovative approach for increasing customer retention by identifying potential churners based on combinations of predictor variables such as demographics and SQI factors. This empirical study contributes to BI research and practice by demonstrating the application of data analytics to the fundamental business operations problem of customer churn."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8156","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8157","fieldValue":" The rise of social media has fundamentally changed the way information is produced, disseminated, and consumed in the digital age, which has profound economic and business effects. Among many different types of social media, social broadcasting networks such as Twitter in the U.S. and â\u20ACœWeiboâ\u20AC? in China are particularly interesting from a business perspective. In the case of Twitter, the huge amounts of real-time data with extremely rich text, along with valuable structural information, makes Twitter a great platform to build Business Intelligence (BI) systems. We propose a framework of social-broadcasting-based BI systems that utilizes real-time information extracted from these data with text mining techniques. To demonstrate this framework, we designed and implemented a Twitter-based BI system that forecasts movie box office revenues during the opening weekend and forecasts daily revenue after 4 weeks. We found that incorporating information from Twitter could reduce the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 44&percnt; for the opening weekend and by 36&percnt; for total revenue. For daily revenue forecasting, including Twitter information into a baseline model could reduce forecasting errors by 17.5&percnt; on average. On the basis of these results, we conclude that social-broadcasting-based BI systems have great potential and should be explored by both researchers and practitioners."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8157","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8157","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8157","fieldValue":"ACM"}
