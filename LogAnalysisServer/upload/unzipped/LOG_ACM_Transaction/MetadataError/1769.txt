There are m items and n players. Every item has some nonnegative value, and every player is interested in only some of the items. The goal is to distribute the items to the players in a way that maximizes the minimum of the sum of the values of the items given to any player. It was previously shown via a nonconstructive proof that uses the Lovász local lemma that the integrality gap of a certain configuration LP for the problem is no worse than some (unspecified) constant. This gives a polynomial-time algorithm to estimate the optimum value of the problem within a constant factor, but does not provide a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a corresponding allocation. We use a different approach to analyze the integrality gap. Our approach is based upon local search techniques for finding perfect matchings in certain classes of hypergraphs. As a result, we prove that the integrality gap of the configuration LP is no worse than 1\/4. Our proof provides a local search algorithm which finds the corresponding allocation, but is nonconstructive in the sense that this algorithm is not known to converge to a local optimum in a polynomial number of steps."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2541","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2541","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16259","fieldValue":" The radiative transfer framework that underlies all current rendering of volumes is limited to scattering media whose properties are invariant to rotation. Many systems allow for \"anisotropic scattering,\" in the sense that scattered intensity depends on the scattering angle, but the standard equation assumes that the structure of the medium is isotropic. This limitation impedes physics-based rendering of volume models of cloth, hair, skin, and other important volumetric or translucent materials that do have anisotropic structure. This paper presents an end-to-end formulation of physics-based volume rendering of anisotropic scattering structures, allowing these materials to become full participants in global illumination simulations. We begin with a generalized radiative transfer equation, derived from scattering by oriented non-spherical particles. Within this framework, we propose a new volume scattering model analogous to the well-known family of microfacet surface reflection models; we derive an anisotropic diffusion approximation, including the weak form required for finite element solution and a way to compute the diffusion matrix from the parameters of the scattering model; and we also derive a new anisotropic dipole BSSRDF for anisotropic translucent materials. We demonstrate results from Monte Carlo, finite element, and dipole simulations. All these contributions are readily implemented in existing rendering systems for volumes and translucent materials, and they all reduce to the standard practice in the isotropic case."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16259","fieldValue":"BSSRDF"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16259","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16260","fieldValue":" We present an efficient technique to render single scattering in large scenes with reflective and refractive objects and homogeneous participating media. Efficiency is obtained by evaluating the final radiance along a viewing ray directly from the lighting rays passing near to it, and by rapidly identifying such lighting rays in the scene. To facilitate the search for nearby lighting rays, we convert lighting rays and viewing rays into 6D points and planes according to their Plücker coordinates and coefficients, respectively. In this 6D line space, the problem of closest lines search becomes one of closest points to a plane query, which we significantly accelerate using a spatial hierarchy of the 6D points. This approach to lighting ray gathering supports complex light paths with multiple reflections and refractions, and avoids the use of a volume representation, which is expensive for large-scale scenes. This method also utilizes far fewer lighting rays than the number of photons needed in traditional volumetric photon mapping, and does not discretize viewing rays into numerous steps for ray marching. With this approach, results similar to volumetric photon mapping are obtained efficiently in terms of both storage and computation."}
