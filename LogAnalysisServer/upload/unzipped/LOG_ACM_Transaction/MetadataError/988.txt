The main features of the approach are the following:A combination of the traditional decomposition and synthesis approaches, thus allowing the use of both functional and multivalued dependencies.Separation of structural dependencies relevant for the design process from integrity constraints, that is, constraints that do not bear any structural information about the data and which should therefore be discarded at the design stage. This separation is supported by a simple syntactic test filtering out nonstructural dependencies.Automatic correction of schemes which lack certain desirable properties."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14026","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14027","fieldValue":" This paper presents a methodology for trading-off the cost of incomplete information against the data-related costs in the design of database systems. It investigates how the usage patterns of the database, defined by the characteristics of information requests presented to it, affect its conceptual design. The construction of minimum-cost answers to information requests for a variety of query types and cost structures is also studied. The resulting costs of incomplete database information are balanced against the data-related costs in the derivation of the optimal design."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14027","fieldValue":"ACM"}
