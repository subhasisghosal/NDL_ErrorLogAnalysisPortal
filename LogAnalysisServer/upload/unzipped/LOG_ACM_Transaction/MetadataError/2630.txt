With this new approach, a translator program is not requiredâ\u20AC\u201Dtranslation of Fortran code for multiprecision is accomplished by merely utilizing advanced features of Fortran 90, such as derived data types and operator extensions. This approach results in more-reliable translation and permits programmers of multiprecision applications to utilize the full power of Fortran 90. Three multiprecision data types are supported in this system: multiprecision integer, real, and complex. All the usual Fortran conventions for mixed-mode operations are supported, and many of the Fortran intrinsics, such as SIN, EXP, and MOD, are supported with multiprecision arguments. An interesting application of this software, wherein new number-theoretic identities have been discovered by means of multiprecision computations, is included also."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18832","fieldValue":"ACM"}
