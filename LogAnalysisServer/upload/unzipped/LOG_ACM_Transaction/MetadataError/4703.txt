Due to the introduction of overall cost as a metric, the traditional use of the highest-end computing configuration is no longer the most obvious choice. Moreover, the unique runtime dynamics and configuration choices of Cloud and VM platforms introduce new design considerations and runtime characteristics specific to PDES over Cloud\/VMs. Here, an empirical study is presented to help understand the dynamics, trends, and trade-offs in executing PDES on Cloud\/VM platforms. Performance and cost measures obtained from multiple PDES applications executed on the Amazon EC2 Cloud and on a high-end VM host machine reveal new, counterintuitive VM--PDES dynamics and guidelines. One of the critical aspects uncovered is the fundamental mismatch in hypervisor scheduler policies designed for general Cloud workloads versus the virtual time ordering needed for PDES workloads. This insight is supported by experimental data revealing the gross deterioration in PDES performance traceable to VM scheduling policy. To overcome this fundamental problem, the design and implementation of a new deadlock-free scheduler algorithm are presented, optimized specifically for PDES applications on VMs. The scalability of our scheduler has been tested in up to 128 VMs multiplexed on 32 cores, showing significant improvement in the runtime relative to the default Cloud\/VM scheduler. The observations, algorithmic design, and results are timely for emerging Cloud\/VM-based installations, highlighting the need for PDES-specific support in high-performance discrete event simulations on Cloud\/VM platforms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25143","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25143","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3432","fieldValue":"OToole, Alice J."}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3432","fieldValue":"Phillips, P Jonathon"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3432","fieldValue":" We compared face identification by humans and machines using images taken under a variety of uncontrolled illumination conditions in both indoor and outdoor settings. Natural variations in a person's day-to-day appearance (e.g., hair style, facial expression, hats, glasses, etc.) contributed to the difficulty of the task. Both humans and machines matched the identity of people (same or different) in pairs of frontal view face images. The degree of difficulty introduced by photometric and appearance-based variability was estimated using a face recognition algorithm created by fusing three top-performing algorithms from a recent international competition. The algorithm computed similarity scores for a constant set of same-identity and different-identity pairings from multiple images. Image pairs were assigned to good, moderate, and poor accuracy groups by ranking the similarity scores for each identity pairing, and dividing these rankings into three strata. This procedure isolated the role of photometric variables from the effects of the distinctiveness of particular identities. Algorithm performance for these constant identity pairings varied dramatically across the groups. In a series of experiments, humans matched image pairs from the good, moderate, and poor conditions, rating the likelihood that the images were of the same person (1: sure same - 5: sure different). Algorithms were more accurate than humans in the good and moderate conditions, but were comparable to humans in the poor accuracy condition. To date, these are the most variable illumination- and appearance-based recognition conditions on which humans and machines have been compared. The finding that machines were never less accurate than humans on these challenging frontal images suggests that face recognition systems may be ready for applications with comparable difficulty. We speculate that the superiority of algorithms over humans in the less challenging conditions may be due to the algorithms' use of detailed, view-specific identity information. Humans may consider this information less important due to its limited potential for robust generalization in suboptimal viewing conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3432","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3432","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25144","fieldValue":" Emergence becomes a distinguishing system feature as system complexity grows with the number of components, interactions, and connectivities. Examples of emergent behaviors include the flocking of birds, traffic jams, and hubs in social networks, among others. Despite significant research interest in recent years, there is a lack of formal methods to understand, identify, and predict emergent behavior in multiagent systems. Existing approaches either require detailed prior knowledge about emergent behavior or are computationally infeasible. This article introduces a grammar-based approach to formalize and identify the existence and extent of emergence without the need for prior knowledge of emergent properties. Our approach is based on weak (basic) emergence that is both generated and autonomous from the underlying agents. We employ formal grammars to capture agent interactions in the forms of words written on a common tape. Our formalism captures agents of diverse types and open systems. We propose an automated approach for the identification of emergent behavior and show its benefits through theoretical and experimental analysis. We also propose a significant reduction of state-space explosion through the use of our proposed degree of interaction metrics. Our experiments using the boids model show the feasibility of our approach but also highlight future avenues of improvement."}
