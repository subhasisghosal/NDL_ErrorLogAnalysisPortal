We use weighted automata (finite automata with transition weights) to define several natural classes of quantitative languages over finite and infinite words; in particular, the real value of an infinite run is computed as the maximum, limsup, liminf, limit average, or discounted sum of the transition weights. We define the classical decision problems of automata theory (emptiness, universality, language inclusion, and language equivalence) in the quantitative setting and study their computational complexity. As the decidability of the language-inclusion problem remains open for some classes of weighted automata, we introduce a notion of quantitative simulation that is decidable and implies language inclusion. We also give a complete characterization of the expressive power of the various classes of weighted automata. In particular, we show that most classes of weighted automata cannot be determinized."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11585","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11585","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11586","fieldValue":" We study the computational complexity of Boolean constraint satisfaction problems with cardinality constraint. A Galois connection between clones and coclones has received a lot of attention in the context of complexity considerations for constraint satisfaction problems. This connection does not seem to help when considering constraint satisfaction problems that support in addition a cardinality constraint. We prove that a similar Galois connection, involving a weaker closure operator and partial polymorphisms, can be applied to such problems. Thus, we establish dichotomies for the decision as well as for the counting problems in Schaefer's framework."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11586","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11586","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11587","fieldValue":"Dezani-Ciancaglini, Mariangiola"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11587","fieldValue":" The study of type isomorphisms for different λ-calculi started over twenty years ago, and a very wide body of knowledge has been established, both in terms of results and in terms of techniques. A notable missing piece of the puzzle was the characterization of type isomorphisms in the presence of intersection types. While, at first thought, this may seem to be a simple exercise, it turns out that not only finding the right characterization is not simple, but that the very notion of isomorphism in intersection types is an unexpectedly original element in the previously known landscape, breaking most of the known properties of isomorphisms of the typed λ-calculus. In particular, isomorphism is not a congruence and types that are equal in the standard models of intersection types may be nonisomorphic."}
