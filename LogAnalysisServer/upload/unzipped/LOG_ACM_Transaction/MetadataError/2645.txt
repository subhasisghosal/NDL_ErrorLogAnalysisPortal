Given a supply of â\u20ACœgoodâ\u20AC? uniform (0,1) variates, the procedure makes use of composition method, squeeze method, and aliasing to generate gamma variates. Comparison with existing methods shows that the author's method is faster in terms of computer time and uses a smaller number of uniform (0,1) variates. The method is also statistically exact."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18869","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18869","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18870","fieldValue":" Two modifications of Bartels and Conn's algorithm for solving linearly constrained discrete l1 problems are described.
