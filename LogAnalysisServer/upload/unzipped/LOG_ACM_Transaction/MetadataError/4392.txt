In contrast to past work, we show that measuring a statistically significant improvement over a weak baseline is not a good predictor of whether a similar improvement will be measured on a strong baseline. Sometimes strong baselines are made worse when a new technique is applied. We investigate whether conducting comparisons against a range of weaker baselines can increase confidence that an observed effect will also show improvements on a stronger baseline. Our results indicate that this is not the case -- at best, testing against a range of baselines means that an experimenter can be more confident that the new technique is unlikely to significantly harm a strong baseline. Examining recent past work, we present evidence that the information retrieval (IR) community continues to test against weak baselines. This is unfortunate as, in light of our experiments, we conclude that the only way to be confident that a new technique is a contribution is to compare it against nothing less than the state of the art."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24156","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24157","fieldValue":" The evolution potential estimation of news events can support the decision making of both corporations and governments. For example, a corporation could manage its public relations crisis in a timely manner if a negative news event about this corporation is known with large evolution potential in advance. However, existing state-of-the-art methods are mainly based on time series historical data, which are not suitable for the news events with limited historical data and bursty properties. In this article, we propose a purely content-based method to estimate the evolution potential of the news events. The proposed method considers a news event at a given time point as a system composed of different keywords, and the uncertainty of this system is defined and measured as the Semantic Uncertainty of this news event. At the same time, an uncertainty space is constructed with two extreme states: the most uncertain state and the most certain state. We believe that the Semantic Uncertainty has correlation with the content evolution of the news events, so it can be used to estimate the evolution potential of the news events. In order to verify the proposed method, we present detailed experimental setups and results measuring the correlation of the Semantic Uncertainty with the Content Change of news events using collected news events data. The results show that the correlation does exist and is stronger than the correlation of value from the time-series-based method with the Content Change. Therefore, we can use the Semantic Uncertainty to estimate the evolution potential of news events."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24157","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24157","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24158","fieldValue":" Query auto-completion assists web search users in formulating queries with a few keystrokes, helping them to avoid spelling mistakes and to produce clear query expressions, and so on. Previous work on query auto-completion mainly centers around returning a list of completions to users, aiming to push queries that are most likely intended by the user to the top positions but ignoring the redundancy among the query candidates in the list. Thus, semantically related queries matching the input prefix are often returned together. This may push valuable suggestions out of the list, given that only a limited number of candidates can be shown to the user, which may result in a less than optimal search experience. In this article, we consider the task of diversifying query auto-completion, which aims to return the correct query completions early in a ranked list of candidate completions and at the same time reduce the redundancy among query auto-completion candidates. We develop a greedy query selection approach that predicts query completions based on the current search popularity of candidate completions and on the aspects of previous queries in the same search session. The popularity of completion candidates at query time can be directly aggregated from query logs. However, query aspects are implicitly expressed by previous clicked documents in the search context. To determine the query aspect, we categorize clicked documents of a query using a hierarchy based on the open directory project. Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization is applied to derive the distribution of queries over all aspects. We quantify the improvement of our greedy query selection model against a state-of-the-art baseline using two large-scale, real-world query logs and show that it beats the baseline in terms of well-known metrics used in query auto-completion and diversification. In addition, we conduct a side-by-side experiment to verify the effectiveness of our proposal."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24158","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24158","fieldValue":"ACM"}
