In order to eliminate the costly requirement for accurate event control in existing methods, we present a practical design using uncontrolled events. The main idea is to estimate both event generation parameters and the location of sensor nodes simultaneously, by processing node sequences that can be easily obtained from event detections. Besides the basic design, we proposed two enhancements to further extract information embedded in node orderings for two scenarios: (i) node density is high; and (ii) abundant events are available. To demonstrate the generality of our design, both straight-line scan and circular wave propagation events are addressed in the article, and we evaluated the design with extensive simulation as well as a testbed implementation with 41 MICAz motes. Results show that with only randomly generated events, our design can effectively localize nodes with great flexibility while adding little extra cost at the resource constrained sensor node side. In addition, localization via uncontrolled events provides a potential option of achieving node positioning through long-term ambient events."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6572","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6572","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6573","fieldValue":"Lu, Yung-Hsiang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6573","fieldValue":" Mobile systems such as PDAs and cell phones play an increasing role in handling visual contents such as images. Thousands of images can be stored in a mobile system with the advances in storage technology: this creates the need for better organization and retrieval of these images. Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a method to retrieve images based on their visual contents. In CBIR, images are compared by matching their numerical representations called features; CBIR is computation and memory intensive and consumes significant amounts of energy. This article examines energy conservation for CBIR on mobile systems. We present three improvements to save energy while performing the computation on the mobile system: selective loading, adaptive loading, and caching features in memory. Using these improvements adaptively reduces the features to be loaded into memory for each search. The reduction is achieved by estimating the difficulty of the search. If the images in the collection are dissimilar, fewer features are sufficient; less computation is performed and energy can be saved. We also consider the effect of consecutive user queries and show how features can be cached in memory to save energy. We implement a CBIR algorithm on an HP iPAQ hw6945 and show that these improvements can save energy and allow CBIR to scale up to 50,000 images on a mobile system. We further investigate if energy can be saved by migrating parts of the computation to a server, called computation offloading. We analyze the impact of the wireless bandwidth, server speed, number of indexed images, and the number of image queries on the energy consumption. Using our scheme, CBIR can be made energy efficient under all conditions."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6573","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6573","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6574","fieldValue":" In this article, a brand new method of determining deadlock is presented. Most previous deadlock detection methods are algorithmic in the sense that they usually leverage some forms of Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) representations and then algorithms are devised to manipulate such representations in order to detect deadlock using information contained in the graph. Different from all previous methods, the proposed method actualizes the RAG with a digital circuit and uses it as a token-transmitting network. By supplying special input signals (tokens) to the network and observing the output tokens from the network, it is easier to identify which process nodes are reachable from each resource node in the graph. Using the reachability information, deadlock can be detected immediately. The time required to obtain the reachability information is determined by how fast the combinational circuit operates. Compared with previous algorithmic methods, the proposed deadlock detection can be deemed instant. We show that the proposed method is an order of magnitude faster than the previous fastest hardware mechanism and several orders of magnitude faster than traditional software-based algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6574","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6574","fieldValue":"ACM"}
