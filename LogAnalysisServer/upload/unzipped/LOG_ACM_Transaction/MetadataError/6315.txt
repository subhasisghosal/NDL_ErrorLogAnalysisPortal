This paper proposes software-controlled fault tolerance, a concept allowing designers and users to tailor their performance and reliability for each situation. Several software-controllable fault-detection techniques are then presented: SWIFT, a software-only technique, and CRAFT, a suite of hybrid hardware\/software techniques. Finally, the paper introduces PROFiT, a technique which adjusts the level of protection and performance at fine granularities through software control. When coupled with software-controllable techniques like SWIFT and CRAFT, PROFiT offers attractive and novel reliability options."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1623","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1623","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6803","fieldValue":"Stankovic, John A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6803","fieldValue":" The primary goal of breadcrumb trail sensor networks is to transmit in real-time users' physiological parameters that measure life-critical functions to an incident commander through reliable multihop communication. In applications using breadcrumb solutions, there are often many users working together, and this creates a well-known body shadowing effect (BSE). In this article, we first measure the characteristics of body shadowing for 2.4GHz sensor nodes. Our empirical results show that the body shadowing effect leads to severe packet loss and consequently very poor real-time performance. Then we develop a novel Intentional Forwarding solution. This solution accurately detects the shadowing mode and enables selected neighbors to forward data packets. Experimental results from a fully implemented testbed demonstrate that Intentional Forwarding is able to improve the end-to-end average packet delivery ratio (PDR) from 58&percnt; to 93&percnt; and worst-case PDR from 45&percnt; to 85&percnt;, and is able to meet soft real-time requirements even under severe body shadowing problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6803","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6803","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6804","fieldValue":" Rapid prototyping is an important step in the development and the verification of computationally demanding tasks of digital communication systems, such as Forward Error Correction (FEC) decoding. The goal is to replace time-consuming simulations based on abstract models of the system with real-time experiments under real-world conditions. GPU-like architecture is a promising approach to fully exploit the potential of FPGA-based acceleration platforms. In this article, an application-specific GPU-like architecture and a complete compilation framework for decoding LDPC codes are proposed. The interest in an application-specific GPU in comparison with current GPUs is detailed. Finally, real-time experimentations demonstrate the potential of the GPU-like decoder to investigate both algorithmic and architectural issues."}
