Traditional methods for gene selection in classification problems have several drawbacks. First, the majority of the gene selection approaches for classification are single-gene based. Second, many of the gene selection procedures are not embedded within the algorithm itself. The technique of random forests has been found to perform well in high-dimensional data settings with survival outcomes. It also has an embedded feature to identify variables of importance. Therefore, it is an ideal candidate for gene selection in high-dimensional data with survival outcomes. In this paper, we develop a novel method based on the random forests to identify a set of prognostic genes. We compare our method with several machine learning methods and various node split criteria using several real data sets. Our method performed well in both simulations and real data analysis. Additionally, we have shown the advantages of our approach over single-gene-based approaches. Our method incorporates multivariate correlations in microarray data for survival outcomes. The described method allows us to better utilize the information available from microarray data with survival outcomes."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4824","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4824","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4824","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4825","fieldValue":" We propose hierarchical motif vectors to represent local amino acid sequence configurations for predicting the functional attributes of amino acid sites on a global scale in a quasi-supervised learning framework. The motif vectors are constructed via wavelet decomposition on the variations of physico-chemical amino acid properties along the sequences. We then formulate a prediction scheme for the functional attributes of amino acid sites in terms of the respective motif vectors using the quasi-supervised learning algorithm that carries out predictions for all sites in consideration using only the experimentally verified sites. We have carried out comparative performance evaluation of the proposed method on the prediction of N-glycosylation of 55,184 sites possessing the consensus N-glycosylation sequon identified over 15,104 human proteins, out of which only 1,939 were experimentally verified N-glycosylation sites. In the experiments, the proposed method achieved better predictive performance than the alternative strategies from the literature. In addition, the predicted N-glycosylation sites showed good agreement with existing potential annotations, while the novel predictions belonged to proteins known to be modified by glycosylation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4825","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4825","fieldValue":"Vectors,Amino acids,Proteins,Humans,Approximation methods,Prediction algorithms,Databases,quasi-supervised learning.,Functional attribute prediction,hierarchical motif vectors,protein sequence analysis"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4825","fieldValue":"Hierarchical Motif Vectors for Prediction of Functional Sites in Amino Acid Sequences Using Quasi-Supervised Learning"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4825","fieldValue":"ACM"}
