The proposed design pattern enables the architecture of a wireless sensor node to adapt to application requirements, thus to significantly reduce system redundancy. Two multisensor structures are parameterized regarding frequency response, power consumption, and cost. The system design pattern provides flexibility through three proposed interface circuits that bridge between multisensor structures and the microprocessors inside sensor nodes. It also allows adjusting time the delay parameter that can enlarge the selection range of main electronic components, and thereby increases the robustness of the model for practical implementations. A virtual case study is provided to demonstrate how to apply this model into an application design."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6983","fieldValue":"Structure Design of Wireless Sensor Nodes with Energy and Cost Awareness for Multichannel Signal Measurement"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6983","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6984","fieldValue":"Hsiu, Pi-Cheng"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6984","fieldValue":"Tseng, Po-Hsien"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6984","fieldValue":"Chen, Wei-Ming"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/6984","fieldValue":"Pan, Chin-Chiang"}
