Rank aggregation helps in meta-analysis of putative results collected from different analytic or experimental sources. For example, we often receive considerably differing ranked lists of genes or microRNAs from various target prediction algorithms or microarray studies. Sometimes combining them all, in some sense, yields more effective ordering of the set of objects. Also, assigning a certain level of confidence to each source of ranking is a natural demand of aggregation. Assignment of weights to the sources of orderings can be performed by experts. Several rank aggregation approaches like those based on Markov Chains (MCs), evolutionary algorithms, etc., exist in the literature. Markov chains, in general, are faster than the evolutionary approaches. Unlike the evolutionary computing approaches Markov chains have not been used for weighted aggregation scenarios. This is because of the absence of a formal framework of Weighted Markov Chain (WMC). In this paper, we propose the use of a modified version of MC4 (one of the Markov chains proposed by Dwork et al., 2001), followed by the weighted analog of local Kemenization for performing rank aggregation, where the sources of rankings can be prioritized by an expert. Effectiveness of the weighted Markov chain approach over the very recently proposed Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Cross-Entropy Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm-based techniques, has been established for gene orderings from microarray analysis and orderings of predicted microRNA targets."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4773","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4773","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4773","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1407","fieldValue":"Wobbrock, Jacob O"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1407","fieldValue":"Gajos, Krzysztof Z"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1407","fieldValue":" Prior research shows that people with motor impairments face considerable challenges when using conventional mice and trackballs. One challenge is positioning the mouse cursor within confined target areas; another is executing a precise click without slipping. These problems can make mouse pointing in graphical user interfaces very difficult for some people. This article explores goal crossing as an alternative strategy for more accessible target acquisition. In goal crossing, targets are boundaries that are simply crossed by the mouse cursor. Thus, goal crossing avoids the two aforementioned problems. To date, however, researchers have not examined the feasibility of goal crossing for people with motor difficulties. We therefore present a study comparing area pointing and goal crossing. Our performance results indicate that although Fitts' throughput for able-bodied users is higher for area pointing than for goal crossing (4.72 vs. 3.61 bits\/s), the opposite is true for users with motor impairments (2.34 vs. 2.88 bits\/s). However, error rates are higher for goal crossing than for area pointing under a strict definition of crossing errors (6.23% vs. 1.94%). We also present path analyses and an examination of submovement velocity, acceleration, and jerk (the change in acceleration over time). These results show marked differences between crossing and pointing and almost categorically favor crossing. An important finding is that crossing reduces jerk for both participant groups, indicating more fluid, stable motion. To help realize the potential of goal crossing for computer access, we offer design concepts for crossing widgets that address the occlusion problem, which occurs when one crossing goal obscures another in persistent mouse-cursor interfaces. This work provides the motivation and initial steps for further exploration of goal crossing on the desktop, and may help researchers and designers to radically reshape user interfaces to provide accessible goal crossing, thereby lowering barriers to access."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1407","fieldValue":"Goal Crossing with Mice and Trackballs for People with Motor Impairments: Performance, Submovements, and Design Directions"}
