{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2218","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of scheduling a set of n unit-execution-time (UET) tasks, with precedence constraints, on m â\u2030¥ 1 parallel and identical processors so as to minimize the mean flow time. For two processors, the Coffman--Graham algorithm gives a schedule that simultaneously minimizes the mean flow time and the makespan. The problem becomes strongly NP-hard for an arbitrary number of processors, although the complexity is not known for each fixed m â\u2030¥ 3. For arbitrary precedence constraints, we show that the Coffman--Graham algorithm gives a schedule with a worst-case bound no more than 2, and we give examples showing that the bound is tight. For intrees, the problem can be solved in polynomial time for each fixed m â\u2030¥ 1, although the complexity is not known for an arbitrary number of processors. We show that Hu's algorithm (which is optimal for the makespan objective) yields a schedule with a worst-case bound no more than 1.5, and we give examples showing that the ratio can approach 1.308999."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2218","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2218","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12803","fieldValue":"Chen, Yue-Tsang"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12803","fieldValue":"Jou, Shyh-Jye"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12803","fieldValue":" A parasitic effect removal methodology is proposed to handle the large parasitic effects in analog testability buses. The removal is done by an on-chip test generation technique and an intrinsic response extraction algorithm. On-chip test generation creates test signals on-chip to avoid the parasitic effects of the test application bus. The intrinsic response extraction cross-checks and cancels the parasitic effects of both test application and response observation paths. The tests using both SPICE simulation and MNABST-1 P1149.4 test chip reveal that the proposed algorthm can not only remove the parasitic effects of the test buses but also tolerate test signal variations. Furthermore, it is robust enough to handle loud environmental noise and the nonlinearity of the switching devices."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12803","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12803","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12804","fieldValue":"Huang, Shi-Yu"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12804","fieldValue":"Cheng, Kwang-Ting"}
