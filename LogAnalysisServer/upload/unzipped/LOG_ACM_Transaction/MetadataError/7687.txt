Due to low recharging rates and the dynamics of renewable energy such as solar and wind power, providing services without interruptions caused by battery runouts is nontrivial. Most environment monitoring applications require data collection from all nodes at a steady rate. The objective of this paper is to design a solution for fair and high throughput data extraction from all nodes in the presence of renewable energy sources. Specifically, we seek to compute the lexicographically maximum data collection rate and routing paths for each node such that no node will ever run out of energy. We propose a centralized algorithm and two distributed algorithms. The centralized algorithm jointly computes the optimal data collection rate for all nodes along with the flows on each link, the first distributed algorithm computes the optimal rate when the routing structure is a given tree, and the second distributed algorithm, although heuristic, jointly computes a routing structure and a high lexicographic rate assignment that is nearly optimum. We prove the optimality for the centralized and the first distributed algorithm, and use real test-bed experiments and extensive simulations to evaluate both of the distributed algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10185","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10185","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10185","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10186","fieldValue":" In this paper, we investigate the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) gear for wireless sensor network construction, aiming to find events of interest and gather aggregate information. In particular, we develop a featherlight information network with delay-endurable RFID support (FINDERS), composed of passive RFID tags that are ultralight, durable, and flexible, without power supply for long-lasting applications. FINDERS faces unprecedented challenges in communication and networking due to its sporadic wireless links, unique asymmetric communication paradigm, intermittent computation capability, and extremely small memory of tags. Several effective techniques are proposed to address these challenges, arriving at an efficient communication protocol for FINDERS. A prototype system is developed, and test-bed experiments are carried out with 38 participants and for 9 days, yielding interesting experimental results that offer valuable insights into RFID-based delay-tolerant networks and provide useful practical guidance for the setup of FINDERS systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10186","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
