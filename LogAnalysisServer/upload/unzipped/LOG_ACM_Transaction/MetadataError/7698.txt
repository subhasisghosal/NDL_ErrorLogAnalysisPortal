A spread estimator is a software\/hardware module on a router that inspects the arrival packets and estimates the spread of each source. It has important applications in detecting port scans and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, measuring the infection rate of a worm, assisting resource allocation in a server farm, determining popular Web contents for caching, to name a few. The main technical challenge is to fit a spread estimator in a fast but small memory (such as SRAM) in order to operate it at the line speed in a high-speed network. In this paper, we design a new spread estimator that delivers good performance in tight memory space where all existing estimators no longer work. The new estimator not only achieves space compactness, but operates more efficiently than the existing ones. Its accuracy and efficiency come from a new method for data storage, called virtual vectors, which allow us to measure and remove the errors in spread estimation. We also propose several ways to enhance the range of spread values that the estimator can measure. We perform extensive experiments on real Internet traces to verify the effectiveness of the new estimator."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10207","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1928","fieldValue":"Saghir, Mazen A R"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1928","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose new extensions to Hadoop to enable clusters of reconfigurable active solid-state drives (RASSDs) to process streaming data from SSDs using FPGAs. We also develop an analytical model to estimate the performance of RASSD clusters running under Hadoop. Using the Hadoop RASSD platform and network simulators, we validate our design and demonstrate its impact on performance for different workloads taken from Stanford's Phoenix MapReduce project. Our results show that for a hardware acceleration factor of 20Ã\u2014, compute-intensive workloads processing 153MB of data can run up to 11Ã\u2014 faster than a standard Hadoop cluster."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1928","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1928","fieldValue":"ACM"}
