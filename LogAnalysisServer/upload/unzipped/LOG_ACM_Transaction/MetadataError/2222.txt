We present a system to help people create frame-by-frame animations through manual sketches. We design our interface to be minimalistic: it contains only a canvas and a few controls. When users draw on the canvas, our system silently analyzes all past sketches and predicts what might be drawn in the future across spatial locations and temporal frames. The interface also offers suggestions to beautify existing drawings. Our system can reduce manual workload and improve output quality without compromising natural drawing flow and control: users can accept, ignore, or modify such predictions visualized on the canvas by simple gestures. Our key idea is to extend the local similarity method in [Xing et al. 2014], which handles only low-level spatial repetitions such as hatches within a single frame, to a global similarity that can capture high-level structures across multiple frames such as dynamic objects. We evaluate our system through a preliminary user study and confirm that it can enhance both users' objective performance and subjective satisfaction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17405","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17406","fieldValue":" Many tasks in geometry processing and physical simulation benefit from multiresolution hierarchies. One important characteristic across a variety of applications is that coarser layers strictly encage finer layers, nesting one another. Existing techniques such as surface mesh decimation, voxelization, or contouring distance level sets do not provide sufficient control over the quality of the output surfaces while maintaining strict nesting. We propose a solution that enables use of application-specific decimation and quality metrics. The method constructs each next-coarsest level of the hierarchy, using a sequence of decimation, flow, and contact-aware optimization steps. From coarse to fine, each layer then fully encages the next while retaining a snug fit. The method is applicable to a wide variety of shapes of complex geometry and topology. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our nested cages not only for multigrid solvers, but also for conservative collision detection, domain discretization for elastic simulation, and cage-based geometric modeling."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17406","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1189","fieldValue":" In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the dynamics of vehicle traffic flow and traffic congestion by interpreting traffic as a multiparticle system. This helps to explain the onset and persistence of many undesired phenomena, for example, traffic jams. It also reflects the apparent helplessness of drivers in traffic, who feel like passive particles that are pushed around by exterior forces; one of the crucial aspects is the inability to communicate and coordinate with other traffic participants. We present distributed methods for solving these fundamental problems, employing modern wireless, ad-hoc, multi-hop networks. The underlying idea is to use these capabilities as the basis for self-organizing methods for coordinating data collection and processing, recognizing traffic phenomena, and changing their structure by coordinated behavior. The overall objective is a multi-level approach that reaches from protocols for local wireless communication, data dissemination, pattern recognition, over hierarchical structuring and coordinated behavior, all the way to large-scale traffic regulation. In this article, we describe three types of results: (i) self-organizing and distributed methods for maintaining and collecting data (using our concept of Hovering Data Clouds); (ii) adaptive data dissemination for traffic information systems; (iii) methods for self-recognition of traffic jams. We conclude by describing higher-level aspects of our work."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1189","fieldValue":"ACM"}
