We consider multiple competing ISPs who offer network access to a fixed user base, consisting of end-users who differ in their quality requirements and willingness to pay for the access. We model user-ISP interactions as a game in which each ISP makes capacity and pricing decisions to maximize its profits and the end-users only decide which service to buy (if any) and from which ISP. Our model provides pricing for networks with single- and two-service classes for any number of competing ISPs. Our results indicate that multiple service classes are socially desirable, but could be blocked due to the unfavorable distributional consequences that it inflicts on the existing Internet users. We propose a simple regulatory tool to alleviate the political economic constraints and thus make multiple service classes in the Internet feasible."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10091","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10091","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10091","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10092","fieldValue":" In this paper, we consider wireless mobile sensor networks under extreme environments where nodes: 1) have local knowledge; 2) have limited computational power; 3) make distributed decisions; and 4) move rapidly over time. Information dissemination in these networks (or gossip) can be modeled via epidemic models that analyze behavior of the system mimicking the way diseases spread (or even gossip for that matter). However, the limitation on computational power and energy of nodes forces us to consider explicit stopping criteria that are seldom done in the literature. Furthermore, harsh environments considered in this paper prevent nodes from transmitting sensed information at specified time slots and hence might cause a large variation in intertransmission time distribution. The objective of this paper is to characterize the dynamics of the information spread and obtain performance measures based on stochastic modeling. We start with modeling information flow using a Markov chain and obtain performance measures such as time to transfer information and fraction of nodes receiving information. Then, we provide a method to obtain those performance measures when the assumption on intertransmission time distribution is relaxed, e.g., time-varying transmission rates and nonexponential intertransmission time distributions, which makes our model more realistic. We make a curious finding in that, for our proposed model, the average fraction of nodes receiving information is a parameter-free constant. We also show that our model is scalable and effective."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10092","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10092","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10092","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1917","fieldValue":" Continual Flow Pipelines (CFPs) allow a processor core to process hundreds of in-flight instructions without increasing cycle-critical pipeline resources. When a load misses the data cache, CFP checkpoints the processor register state and then moves all miss-dependent instructions into a low-complexity WB to unblock the pipeline. Meanwhile, miss-independent instructions execute normally and update the processor state. When the miss data return, CFP replays the miss-dependent instructions from the WB and then merges the miss-dependent and miss-independent execution results. CFP was initially proposed for cache misses to DRAM. Later work focused on reducing the execution overhead of CFP by avoiding the pipeline flush before replaying miss-dependent instructions and executing dependent and independent instructions concurrently. The goal of these improvements was to gain performance by applying CFP to L1 data cache misses that hit the last level on chip cache. However, many applications or execution phases of applications incur excessive amount of replay and\/or rollbacks to the checkpoint. This frequently cancels benefits from CFP and reduces performance. In this article, we improve the CFP architecture by using a novel virtual register renaming substrate and by tuning the replay policies to mitigate excessive replays and rollbacks to the checkpoint. We describe these new design optimizations and show, using Spec 2006 benchmarks and microarchitecture performance and power models of our design, that our Tuned-CFP architecture improves performance and energy consumption over previous CFP architectures by ∼10&percnt; and ∼8&percnt;, respectively. We also demonstrate that our proposed architecture gives better performance return on energy per instruction compared to a conventional superscalar as well as previous CFP architectures."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1917","fieldValue":"ACM"}
