In addition to its openness, we have designed, GamingAnywhere for high extensibility, portability, and reconfigurability. We implemented it on Windows, Linux, OS X, and Android. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Our experimental results indicate that GamingAnywhere is efficient, scalable, adaptable to network conditions, and achieves high responsiveness and streaming quality. GamingAnywhere can be employed by researchers, game developers, service providers, and end users for setting up cloud gaming testbeds, which we believe, will stimulate more research into innovations for cloud gaming systems and applications."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25613","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25613","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25614","fieldValue":"Muntean, Gabriel-Miro"}
