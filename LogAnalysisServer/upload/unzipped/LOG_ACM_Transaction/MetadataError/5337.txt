Diverse, biologically-meaningful, sequence-based features were extracted from the sequences and used as inputs to the in silico prediction models. Another contribution of this work is the generation of potentially novel and testable predictions about the surface protein DGF-1 family in Trypanosoma cruzi. Finally, these techniques are potentially useful for the automated annotation of known adhesin-like proteins from the trans-sialidase surface protein family in T. cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4458","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4458","fieldValue":"Machine Learning Techniques for the Automated Classification of Adhesin-Like Proteins in the Human Protozoan Parasite Trypanosoma cruzi"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4458","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4459","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4459","fieldValue":"Call for Papers: Special Issue of Transactions in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics: Special Issue on BioCreative II.5"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4459","fieldValue":"ACM"}
