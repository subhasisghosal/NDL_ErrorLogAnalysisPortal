{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19217","fieldValue":" This article reports an unexpected and rather erratic behavior of the LAPACK software implementation of the QR factorization with Businger-Golub column pivoting. It is shown that, due to finite precision arithmetic, the software implementation of the factorization can catastrophically fail to produce a properly structured triangular factor, thus leading to a potentially severe underestimate of a matrix's numerical rank. The 30-year old problem, dating back to LINPACK, has (undetectedly) badly affected many computational routines and software packages, as well as the study of rank-revealing QR factorizations. We combine computer experiments and numerical analysis to isolate, analyze, and fix the problem. Our modification of the current LAPACK xGEQP3 routine is already included in the LAPACK 3.1.0 release. The modified routine is numerically more robust and with a negligible overhead. We also provide a new, equally efficient, and provably numerically safe partial-column norm-updating strategy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19217","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19217","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19218","fieldValue":" In this article we describe our implementations of the FGMRES algorithm for both real and complex, single and double precision arithmetics suitable for serial, shared-memory, and distributed-memory computers. For the sake of portability, simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency, the FGMRES solvers have been implemented in Fortran 77 using the reverse communication mechanism for the matrix-vector product, the preconditioning, and the dot-product computations. For distributed-memory computation, several orthogonalization procedures have been implemented to reduce the cost of the dot-product calculation, which is a well-known bottleneck of efficiency for Krylov methods. Furthermore, either implicit or explicit calculation of the residual at restart is possible depending on the actual cost of the matrix-vector product. Finally, the implemented stopping criterion is based on a normwise backward error."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19218","fieldValue":"FGMRES"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19218","fieldValue":"Algorithm 881: A Set of Flexible GMRES Routines for Real and Complex Arithmetics on High-Performance Computers"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19218","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19218","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19219","fieldValue":"van Deun, Joris"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19219","fieldValue":"Weideman, J A C"}
