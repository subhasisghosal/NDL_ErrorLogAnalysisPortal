We can imagine that in the future this trend will actually be extended to situations where virtual buyer and seller agents will conduct automated transactions across the network, and that large sectors of the economy may be strucured in this manner. The purpose of this article is to model automated bidders and sellers which interact through a network. We model the bidding process as a random arrival process while the price attained by a good is modeled as a discrete random variable. We obtain analytical solutions allowing us to compute the income from a single auction, or the income per unit time from a repeated sequence of auctions. A variety of single-auction models are studied, including English and Vickrey auctions, and the income per unit time is derived as a function of other parameters, including the rate of arrival of bids, the seller's decision time, the value of the good, and the â\u20ACœrest timeâ\u20AC? of the seller between successive auctions. We illustrate the results via numerical examples. We also introduce a model for networked auctions where bidders can circulate among a set of interconnected auctions which we call the Mobile Bidder Model (MBM). We obtain an analytical solution for the MBM under the assumption,which we call the â\u20ACœactive bidders assumption,â\u20AC? that activities that are internal to an auction (bids and sales) are much more frequent than changes that occur in the number of bidders at each auction."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24397","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3366","fieldValue":"Schulte-Pelkum, Jrg"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3366","fieldValue":" It is still an unsolved problem how to optimally simulate self-motion using motion simulators. We investigated how a forward acceleration can be simulated as believably as possible on a hexapod motion platform equipped with a projection screen. Human participants rated the believability of brief forward accelerations. These were simulated as visual forward accelerations over a ground plane with people as size cues, presented together with brief forward surge translations and backward pitches of the platform, and synchronous random up--down movements of the camera in the visual scene and the platform. The magnitudes of all of the parameters were varied independently across trials. Even though variability between participants was high, the most believable simulation occurred when visual accelerations were combined with backward pitches of the platform, which changed the gravitoinertial vector direction approximately consistent with the visual acceleration. However, a wide range of platform pitches was accepted as believable. With high visual acceleration cues most participants reported trials as realistic even when the platform tilt rate was above vestibular canal thresholds reported in other works. Other manipulated parameters had only a mild influence on the responses. These results can be used to optimize motion-cueing algorithms for simulating linear accelerations in motion simulators."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3366","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3366","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24398","fieldValue":" There is an increasing number of people reading, writing, and commenting on blogs. According to a recent survey made by Technorati, there are about 75,000 new blogs and 1.2 million new posts everyday. However, it is difficult and time consuming for a blog reader to find the most interesting posts in the huge and dynamic blog world. In this article, an online Personalized Blog Reader (PBR) system is proposed, which facilitates blog readers in browsing the coolest and newest blog posts of their interests by automatically clustering the most relevant stories. PBR aims to make a user's potential favorite topics always ranked higher than those nonfavorite ones. This is accomplished in the following steps. First, the system collects and provides a unified incremental index of posts coming from different blogs. Then, an incremental clustering algorithm with a flexible half-bounded window of observation is proposed to satisfy the requirements of online processing. It learns people's personalized reading preferences to present a user with a final reading list. The experimental results show that the proposed incremental clustering algorithm is effective and efficient, and the personalization of the PBR performs well."}
