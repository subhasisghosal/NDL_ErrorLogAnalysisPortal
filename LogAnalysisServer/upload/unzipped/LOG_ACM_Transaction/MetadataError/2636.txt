This special linear system of equations, and its transpose, arises in computing error bounds for computed eigenvalues and eigenspaces of the generalized eigenvalue problem S-Î»T, in computing deflating subspaces of the same problem, and in computing certain decompositions of transfer matrices arising in control theory. Our contributions are twofold. First, we reorganize the standard algorithm for this problem to use Level 3 BLAS operations, like matrix multiplication, in its inner loop. This speeds up the algorithm by a factor of 9 on an IBM RS6000. Second, we develop and compare several condition estimation algorithms, which inexpensively but accurately estimate the sensitivity of the solution of this linear system."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18846","fieldValue":"LAPACK"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18846","fieldValue":"LAPACK-style algorithms and software for solving the generalized Sylvester equation and estimating the separation between regular matrix pairs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18846","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/18847","fieldValue":"Resende, Mauricio G C"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18847","fieldValue":" In the NP-complete quadratic assignment problem (QAP), n facilities are to be assigned to n sites at minimum cost. The contribution of assigning facility i to site k and facility j to site l to the total cost is fij dkl, where fij is the flow between facilities i and j, and dkl is the distance between sites k and l. Only very small (nâ\u2030¤20) instances of the QAP have been solved exactly, and heuristics are therefore used to produce approximate solutions. This article describes a set of Fortran subroutines to find approximate solutions to dense quadratic assignment problems, having at least one symmetric flow or distance matrix. A greedy, randomized, adaptive search procedure (GRASP) is used to produce the solutions. The design and implementation of the code are described in detail, and extensive computational experiments are reported, illustrating solution quality as a function of running time."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18847","fieldValue":"GRASP"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18847","fieldValue":"Algorithm 754: Fortran subroutines for approximate solution of dense quadratic assignment problems using GRASP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18847","fieldValue":"ACM"}
