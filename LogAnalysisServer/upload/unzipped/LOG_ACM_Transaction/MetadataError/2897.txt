Their stable numerical computation, when the full solution is sought, is considered solved since the seminal work of Bartels and Stewart [1972] and its generalization by Penzl [1997]. Those variants do not go completely beyond BLAS level-2 style implementation. On modern computers, however, the formulation of level-3 BLAS type implementations is crucial to enable optimal usage of cache hierarchies and modern block scheduling methods based on directed acyclic graphs describing the interdependence of single block computations. Although there exists a recursive blocked solution scheme for (quasi-) triangular generalized Lyapunov equations [Jonsson and Kågström 2002b], we focus on standard blocking techniques. Using the standard blocking approach our contribution lifts the aforementioned level-2 algorithm by Penzl to BLAS level-3 for (quasi-) triangular equations. Especially, we consider the solution of the appearing Sylvester equations and provide a hybrid algorithm merging our strategy with the recursive blocking method above."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19459","fieldValue":"On BLAS Level-3 Implementations of Common Solvers for (Quasi-) Triangular Generalized Lyapunov Equations"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19459","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19459","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19460","fieldValue":"Garrett, C Kristopher"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19460","fieldValue":"Li, Ren-Cang"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19460","fieldValue":" A variation of Kublanovskaya's nonlinear QR method for solving banded nonlinear eigenvalue problems is presented in this article. The new method is iterative and specifically designed for problems too large to use dense linear algebra techniques. For the unstructurally banded nonlinear eigenvalue problem, a new data structure is used for storing the matrices to keep memory and computational costs low. In addition, an algorithm is presented for computing several nearby nonlinear eigenvalues to already-computed ones. Finally, numerical examples are given to show the efficacy of the new methods, and the source code has been made publicly available."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19460","fieldValue":"ACM"}
