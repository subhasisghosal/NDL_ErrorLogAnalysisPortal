The same efficiencies can be achieved for network bandwidth if delivery is over a true broadcast channel. This paper considers the required network bandwidth for on-demand streaming over multicast delivery trees. We consider both simple canonical delivery trees, and more complex cases in which delivery trees are constructed using both existing and new algorithms for randomly generated network topologies and client site locations. Results in this paper quantify the potential savings from use of multicast trees that are configured to minimize network bandwidth rather than the latency to the content server. Further, we determine the network bandwidth usage of particular immediate service and periodic broadcast on-demand streaming protocols. The periodic broadcast protocol is able to simultaneously achieve close to the minimum possible network and server bandwidth usage."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9639","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9639","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9639","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9640","fieldValue":" Balancing of structured peer-to-peer graphs, including their zone sizes, has recently become an important topic of distributed hash table (DHT) research. To bring analytical understanding into the various peer-join mechanisms based on consistent hashing, we study how zone-balancing decisions made during the initial sampling of the peer space affect the resulting zone sizes and derive several asymptotic bounds for the maximum and minimum zone sizes that hold with high probability. Several of our results contradict those of prior work and shed new light on the theoretical performance limitations of consistent hashing. We use simulations to verify our models and compare the performance of the various methods using the example of recently proposed de Bruijn DHTs."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9640","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9640","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9640","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9641","fieldValue":"Wang, Pi-Chung"}
