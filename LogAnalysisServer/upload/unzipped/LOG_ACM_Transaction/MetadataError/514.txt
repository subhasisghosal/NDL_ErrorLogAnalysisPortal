{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12697","fieldValue":" The AGENTS system is a set of programs designed to generate automatically the mask-level layout of full custom CMOS, BICMOS, and bipolar leaf cells. The system is formed from four sever programs: the placer, router, database, and broker.The placer places components in a cell, the router wires the circuits sent to it, the database stores all the information that is dependent upon the fabrication process, such as the design rules, and the Broker makes the services of the other servers available.These servers communicate over a computer network using the TCP\/IP Internet Protocol. The Placer server receives from its client the description and netlist of the circuit to be generated using EDIF (Electronic Design Interchange Format.) The output to its client is the mask layout of the circuit, again codified in EDIF. The comcept of agents as software components which have the ability to communicate and cooperate with each other is at the heart of the AGENTS system. This concept is not only used at the higher level, for the four servers, but at a lower level as well, inside the Router and Placer servers, where small relatively simple agents work together to accomplish complex tasks. These small agents are responsible for all the reasoning carried out by the two servers, as they hold the basic inference routines and the knowledge needed by the servers. The system's philosophy is that competence should emerge out of the collective behavior of a large number of relatively simple agents. In addition and integrated to these small agents, the system uses a genetic algorithm to improve components' placement before routing."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12697","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12697","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/12698","fieldValue":" A genetic algorithm for building-block placement of ICs and MCMs is presented that simultaneously minimizes layout area and an Elmore-based estimate of the maximum path delay while trying to meet a target aspect ratio. Explicit design space exploration is performed by using a vector-valued, 3-dimensional cost function and searching for a set of distinct solutions representing the best trade-offs of the cost dimensions. From the output solutions, the designer can choose the solution with the preferred trade-off. In contrast to existing approaches, the required properties of the output solutions are specified without using weights or bounds. Consequently, the practical problems of specifying these quantities are eliminated. Promising experimental results are obtained for various placement problems, including a real-world design. Solution sets representing good, balanced cost trade-offs are found using a reasonable amount of runtime. Furthermore, the performance is shown to be comparable to that of simulated annealing in the special case of 1-dimensional optimization, in which direct comparison is possible."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/12698","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/12698","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2207","fieldValue":" We study pattern matching for arc-annotated sequences. An O(nm) time algorithm is given for the problem to determine whether a length m sequence with nested arc annotation is an arc-preserving subsequence (aps) of a length n sequence with nested arc annotation, called APS(NESTED,NESTED). Arc-annotated sequences and, in particular, those with nested arc annotation are motivated by applications in RNA structure comparison. Our algorithm generalizes results for ordered tree inclusion problems and it is useful for recent fixed-parameter algorithms for LAPCS(NESTED,NESTED), which is the problem of computing a longest arc-preserving common subsequence of two sequences with nested arc annotations. In particular, the presented dynamic programming methodology implies a quadratic-time algorithm for an open problem posed by Vialette."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2207","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/12699","fieldValue":"Lin, Yann-Rue"}
