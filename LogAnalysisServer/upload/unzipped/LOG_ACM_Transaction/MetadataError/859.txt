Existing power budgeting techniques focus on maximizing performance under a given power budget by optimizing the core configurations. In multicore era, a chip-wide power budget, however, is not sufficient to ensure thermal constraints because the thermal sustainable power capacity varies with different threading strategies and core configurations. In this article, we propose two models to dynamically estimate the thermal sustainable power capacity in homogeneous multicore systems: uniform power model and nonuniform power model. These two models convert the thermal effect of threading strategies and core configurations into power capacity, which provide a context-based core power capacity for power budgeting. Based on these models, we introduce a power budgeting framework aiming to improve the performance within thermal constraints, named as TSocket. Compared to the chip-wide power budgeting solution, TSocket shows 19&percnt; average performance improvement for the PARSEC benchmarks in single program scenario and up to 11&percnt; performance improvement in multiprogram scenario. The performance improvement is achieved by reducing thermal violations and exploring thermal headrooms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13492","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2287","fieldValue":" The approximability of the maximum edge-disjoint paths problem (EDP) in directed graphs was seemingly settled by an $Î©(m^1\/2 âˆ\u2019 &epsis;)-hardness result of Guruswami et al. [2003], and an O(&sqrt;m) approximation achievable via a natural multicommodity-flow-based LP relaxation as well as a greedy algorithm. Here m is the number of edges in the graph. We observe that the Î©(m1\/2 âˆ\u2019 &epsis;)-hardness of approximation applies to sparse graphs, and hence when expressed as a function of n, that is, the number of vertices, only an Î©(n1\/2âˆ\u2019 &epsis;)-hardness follows. On the other hand, O(&sqrt;m)-approximation algorithms do not guarantee a sublinear (in terms of n) approximation algorithm for dense graphs. We note that a similar gap exists in the known results on the integrality gap of the flow-based LP relaxation: an Î©(&sqrt;n) lower bound and O(&sqrt;m) upper bound. Motivated by this discrepancy in the upper and lower bounds, we study algorithms for EDP in directed and undirected graphs and obtain improved approximation ratios. We show that the greedy algorithm has an approximation ratio of O(min(n2\/3, &sqrt;m)) in undirected graphs and a ratio of O(min(n4\/5$, &sqrt;m)) in directed graphs. For acyclic graphs we give an O(&sqrt;n ln n) approximation via LP rounding. These are the first sublinear approximation ratios for EDP. The results also extend to EDP with weights and to the uniform-capacity unsplittable flow problem (UCUFP)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2287","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13493","fieldValue":" Soft error is nowadays a major reliability issue for nanoscale VLSI, and addressing it during high-level synthesis is essential to improve the efficiency of error mitigation. Motivated by the observation that for behavioral designs, especially control-flow intensive ones, variables and operations have non-uniform soft error vulnerabilities, we propose a novel reliability-aware allocation and binding technique to explore more effective soft error mitigation during high level synthesis. We first perform a comprehensive vulnerability analysis at the behavioral level by considering error propagation and masking in both control and data flows. Then the optimizations based on integer linear programming, as well as heuristic algorithm, are employed to incorporate the behavioral vulnerabilities into the register and functional unit binding phases to achieve cost-efficient error mitigation. The experimental results reveal that compared with the previous techniques which ignored behavioral vulnerabilities, the proposed approach can achieve up to 85&percnt; reliability improvement with the same amount of area budget in the RTL design."}
