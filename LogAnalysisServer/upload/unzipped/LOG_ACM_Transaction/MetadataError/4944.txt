For this purpose, realistic body motion, captured from human movements, is being used more frequently for creating characters with natural animations in games and entertainment. However, it is not always clear for programmers and designers which specific motion parameters best convey specific information such as certain emotions, intentions, or traits. We conducted two experiments to investigate whether the perceived traits of actors could be determined from their body motion, and whether these traits were associated with their perceived intentions. We first recorded body motions from 26 professional actors, who were instructed to move in a â\u20ACœheroâ\u20AC?-like or a â\u20ACœvillainâ\u20AC?-like manner. In the first experiment, 190 participants viewed individual video recordings of these actors and were required to provide ratings to the body motion stimuli along a series of different cognitive dimensions (intentions, attractiveness, dominance, trustworthiness, and distinctiveness). The intersubject ratings across observers were highly consistent, suggesting that social traits are readily determined from body motion. Moreover, correlational analyses between these ratings revealed consistent associations across traits, for example, that perceived â\u20ACœgoodâ\u20AC? intentions were associated with higher ratings of attractiveness and dominance. Experiment 2 was designed to elucidate the qualitative body motion cues that were critical for determining specific intentions and traits from the hero- and villain-like body movements. The results revealed distinct body motions that were readily associated with the perception of either â\u20ACœgoodâ\u20AC? or â\u20ACœbadâ\u20AC? intentions. Moreover, regression analyses revealed that these ratings accurately predicted the perception of the portrayed character type. These findings indicate that intentions and social traits are communicated effectively via specific sets of body motion features. Furthermore, these results have important implications for the design of the motion of virtual characters to convey desired social information."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/3513","fieldValue":"&ldquo;Effort Shape&rdquo; analysis"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3513","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1266","fieldValue":" Scientific workflows have become the primary mechanism for conducting analyses on distributed computing infrastructures such as grids and clouds. In recent years, the focus of optimization within scientific workflows has primarily been on computational tasks and workflow makespan. However, as workflow-based analysis becomes ever more data intensive, data optimization is becoming a prime concern. Moreover, scientific workflows can scale along several dimensions: (i) number of computational tasks, (ii) heterogeneity of computational resources, and the (iii) size and type (static versus streamed) of data involved. Adapting workflow structure in response to these scalability challenges remains an important research objective. Understanding how a workflow graph can be restructured in an automated manner (through task merge, for instance), to address constraints of a particular execution environment is explored in this work, using a multi-objective evolutionary approach. Our approach attempts to adapt the workflow structure to achieve both compute and data optimization. The question of when to terminate the evolutionary search in order to conserve computations is tackled with a novel termination criterion. The results presented in this article demonstrate the feasibility of the termination criterion and demonstrate that significant optimization can be achieved with a multi-objective approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_FORMAT_DOI","handle":"12345678_acm\/1266","fieldValue":"{\"doi\":\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2451248.2451252\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1266","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1266","fieldValue":"ACM"}
