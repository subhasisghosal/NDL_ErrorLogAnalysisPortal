To represent words using deeper information, we make explicit the semantic regularity to emerge in word relations, including dependency relations and context relations, and propose a novel architecture for computing continuous vector representation by leveraging those relations. The performance of our model is measured on word analogy task and Protein-Protein Interaction Extraction PPIE task. Experimental results show that our method performs overall better than other word representation models on word analogy task and have many advantages on biomedical text mining."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5340","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/5340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/5340","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5341","fieldValue":"Shackney, Stanley E"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/5341","fieldValue":"Schffer, Alejandro A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/5341","fieldValue":" Ductal Carcinoma In Situ DCIS is a precursor lesion of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma IDC of the breast. Investigating its temporal progression could provide fundamental new insights for the development of better diagnostic tools to predict which cases of DCIS will progress to IDC. We investigate the problem of reconstructing a plausible progression from single-cell sampled data of an individual with synchronous DCIS and IDC. Specifically, by using a number of assumptions derived from the observation of cellular atypia occurring in IDC, we design a possible predictive model using integer linear programming ILP. Computational experiments carried out on a preexisting data set of 13 patients with simultaneous DCIS and IDC show that the corresponding predicted progression models are classifiable into categories having specific evolutionary characteristics. The approach provides new insights into mechanisms of clonal progression in breast cancers and helps illustrate the power of the ILP approach for similar problems in reconstructing tumor evolution scenarios under complex sets of constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.description","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/5341","fieldValue":"Author Affiliation: Departments of Human Oncology and Human Genetics Drexel University School of Medicine (Shackney, Stanley E); Department of Biological Sciences and the Computational Biology Department Carnegie Mellon University (Schwartz, Russell); Computational Biology Branch of NCBI NIH, Bethesda (Schffer, Alejandro A); Louvain School of Management and the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics CORE Universit&#233; Catholique de Louvain UCL, Chausse&#233; de Binche, 151 (Catanzaro, Daniele)"}
