In the first algorithm, Leeb's method is generalized, expanding the Mathieu equation in Fourier series and diagonalizing the symmetric tridiagonal matrix that results. Numerical testing was used to parameterize the minimum matrix dimension that must be used to achieve accuracy in the eigenvalue of one part in 1012. This method returns a set of eigenvalues below a given order and their associated solutions simultaneously. A second algorithm is presented which uses approximations to the eigenvalues (Taylor series and asymptotic expansions) and then iteratively corrects the approximations using Newton's method until the corrections are less than a given tolerance. A backward recursion of the continued fraction expansion is used. The second algorithm is faster and is optimized to obtain accuracy of one part in 1014, but has only been implemented for orders less than 10.5."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/18763","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/18763","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/18764","fieldValue":" Two FORTRAN routines are described which calculate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of Mathieu's differential equation for noninteger as well as integer order, MTIEU1 uses standard matrix techniques with dimension parameterized to give accuracy in the eigenvalue of one part in 1012.
