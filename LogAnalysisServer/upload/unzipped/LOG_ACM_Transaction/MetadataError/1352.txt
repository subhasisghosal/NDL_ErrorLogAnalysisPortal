However, the shadow volume technique requires access to a representation of the scence as a polygonal model, and handling the near plane clip correctly and efficiently is difficult; conversely, accurate shadow maps require high-precision texture map data representations, but these are not widely supported.We present a hybird of the shadow map and shadow volume approaches which does not have these difficulties and leverages high-performance polygon rendering. The scene is rendered from the point of view of the light source and a sampled depth map is recovered. Edge detection and a template-based reconstruction technique are used to generate a global shadow volume boundary surface, after which the pixels in shadow can be marked using only a one-bit stencil buffer and a single-pass rendering of the shadow volume boundary polygons. The simple form of our template-based reconstruction scheme simplifies capping the shadow volume after the near plane clip."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15181","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15181","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15182","fieldValue":"Snchez-Reyes, Javier"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15182","fieldValue":" We propose a unified methodology to tackle geometry processing operations admitting explicit algebraic expressions.

Our strategy is for the mobile robots to implement a self-stabilizing virtual layer consisting of mobile client nodes, stationary Virtual Nodes (VNs), and local broadcast communication. The VNs are associated with predetermined regions in the plane and coordinate among themselves to distribute the client nodes relatively uniformly among the VNs' regions. Each VN directs its local client nodes to align themselves on the local portion of the target curve. The resulting motion coordination protocol is self-stabilizing, in that each robot can begin the execution in any arbitrary state and at any arbitrary location in the plane. In addition, self-stabilization ensures that the robots can adapt to changes in the desired target formation."}
