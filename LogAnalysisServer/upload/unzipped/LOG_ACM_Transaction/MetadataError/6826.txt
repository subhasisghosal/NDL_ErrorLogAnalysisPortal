Microarchitectural techniques for power gating of functional units have been developed by detecting suitable idle regions and turning them off to reduce leakage energy consumption; however, wakeup of functional units is needed when instructions are ready for execution such that wakeup overhead is naturally incurred. This study presents time-based power gating with reference pre-wakeup (PGRP), a novel predictive strategy that detects suitable idle periods for power gating and then enables pre-wakeup of needed functional units for avoiding wakeup overhead. The key insight is that most wakeups are repeated due to program locality. Thus, the pre-wakeup predictor learns the wakeup events and selects which prior branch instruction can provide early wakeup (wakeup patterns are visible); these information are then used to adequately prepare available functional units for instruction execution. Simulation results with benchmarks from SPEC2000 applications show that substantial leakage energy reduction with negligible performance degradation (0.38&percnt; on average) is worthwhile."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1741","fieldValue":"Maintaining performance on power gating of microprocessor functional units by using a predictive pre-wakeup strategy"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1741","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8211","fieldValue":" The probability of IT project failures can be mitigated more successfully when discovered early. To support a more insightful management of IT projects, which may also facilitate an early detection of IT project failures, transparency regarding a project's cash flows shall be increased. Therefore, an appropriate analysis of a project's benefits, costs, requirements, their respective risks and interdependencies is inevitable. However, to date, in requirements engineering only few methods exist that appropriately consider these factors when estimating the ex ante project business case. Furthermore, empirical studies reveal that a lot of risk factors emerge during the runtime of projects why the ex ante valuation of IT projects even with respect to requirements seems insufficient. Therefore, using the Action Design Research approach, we design, apply, and evaluate a practicable method for value-based continuous IT project steering especially for large-scale IT projects."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8211","fieldValue":"Improving Business Value Assurance in Large-Scale IT Projectsâ\u20AC\u201DA Quantitative Method Based on Founded Requirements Assessment"}
