In particular, it focuses on fairness within the Diffserv framework. We propose the Fair Allocation Derivative Estimation (FADE) algorithm for estimating flow fair share in the absence of per-flow information. FADE calculates fair share feedback using a modified quasi-Newton method. This efficient method for estimating fair share provides a more precise model than other existing fairness estimation approaches. As such, it is able to more accurately estimate fair share and quickly converge to the proper rate. The simulation compares FADE to other proposals. The results demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the algorithm."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24838","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24839","fieldValue":" Conventional simulation of cell- or packet-switched networks involves the use of discrete event simulators that model each individual cell through the network, typically called cell-level simulation. Each cells arrival at, or departure from, a network element is represented by an event. However, statistical considerations are such that very large numbers of cells have to be simulated to guarantee the accuracy of the results. This has always caused very long simulation times, often amounting to many hours of real time just to simulate a few minutes of simulated time. In this article we describe a novel methodology for accelerating simulation studies in cell-based communication networks, e.g., ATM, by using a hybrid analytical\/simulation combination. The methodology uses a mathematical technique to seperate foreground traffic from background traffic, and focuses on accelerating cell by cell simulation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24839","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24839","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24840","fieldValue":" As the number of flexible, adaptable systems grows so does the need for specification and analysis tools that support adaptable system structures. The increasing number of simulation tools that equip models with the capability of changing their behavior patterns, composition, and interactions raises the desire for a theoretical and methodological approach. A formalism is introduced based on DEVS which emphasizes the reflective nature of variable structure models. The proposed formalism and DEVS are shown to be bisimilar, which emphasizes the role of variable structure models as an agency of modularization. The formalism is used to reveal general problems and solutions in implementing variable structure models."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24840","fieldValue":"DEVS"}
