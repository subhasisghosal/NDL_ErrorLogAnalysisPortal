{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4810","fieldValue":" A critical component in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is an accurate protein identification procedure. Database search algorithms commonly generate a list of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). The validity of these PSMs is critical for downstream analysis since proteins that are present in the sample are inferred from those PSMs. A variety of postprocessing algorithms have been proposed to validate and filter PSMs. Among them, the most popular ones include a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach known as Percolator and an empirical modeling approach known as PeptideProphet. However, they are predominantly designed for commercial database search algorithms, i.e., SEQUEST and MASCOT. Therefore, it is highly desirable to extend and optimize those PSM postprocessing algorithms for open source database search algorithms such as X!Tandem. In this paper, we propose a Self-boosted Percolator for postprocessing X!Tandem search results. We find that the SSL algorithm utilized by Percolator depends heavily on the initial ranking of PSMs. Starting with a poor PSM ranking list may cause Percolator to perform suboptimally. By implementing Percolator in a cascade learning manner, we can progressively improve the performance through multiple boost runs, enabling many more PSM identifications without sacrificing false discovery rate (FDR)."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4810","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4810","fieldValue":"Databases,Training,Peptides,Support vector machines,Algorithm design and analysis,Proteins,Computational biology,semi-supervised learning.,Proteomics,mass spectrometry,percolator,X!Tandem,peptide-spectrum match (PSM),peptide identification"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4810","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4810","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4811","fieldValue":" RNA-Seq is widely used in transcriptome studies, and the detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two classes of individuals, e.g., cases versus controls, using RNA-Seq is of fundamental importance. Many statistical methods for DEG detection based on RNA-Seq data have been developed and most of them are based on the read counts mapped to individual genes. On the other hand, genes are composed of exons and the distribution of reads for the different exons can be heterogeneous. We hypothesize that the detection accuracy of differentially expressed genes can be increased by analyzing individual exons within a gene and then combining the results of the exons. We therefore developed a novel program, termed CEDER, to accurately detect DEGs by combining the significance of the exons. CEDER first tests for differentially expressed exons yielding a p-value for each, and then gives a score indicating the potential for a gene to be differentially expressed by integrating the p-values of the exons in the gene. We showed that CEDER can significantly increase the accuracy of existing methods for detecting DEGs on two benchmark RNA-Seq data sets and simulated datasets."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4811","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4811","fieldValue":"Accuracy,Bioinformatics,Standards,Statistical analysis,Image edge detection,Genomics,combined p-value statistic.,RNA-Seq,gene expression,differentially expressed gene,high-throughput sequencing"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4811","fieldValue":"CEDER: Accurate Detection of Differentially Expressed Genes by Combining Significance of Exons Using RNA-Seq"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4811","fieldValue":"ACM"}
