The visual system then fuses the interlaced image into a single percept. This row-based interlacing creates a small vertical disparity between the images; however, interlacing may also induce horizontal disparities, thus generating depth artifacts. Whether people perceive the depth artifacts and, if so, what is the magnitude of the artifacts are unknown. In this study, we hypothesized and tested if people perceive interlaced edges on different depth levels. We tested oblique edge orientations ranging from 2 degrees to 32 degrees and pixel sizes ranging from 16 to 79 arcsec of visual angle in a depth probe experiment. Five participants viewed the visual stimuli through a stereoscope under three viewing conditions: noninterlaced, interlaced, and row averaged (i.e., where even and odd rows are averaged). Our results indicated that people perceive depth artifacts when viewing interlaced stereoscopic images and that these depth artifacts increase with pixel size and decrease with edge orientation angle. A pixel size of 32 arcsec of visual angle still evoked depth percepts, whereas 16 arcsec did not. Row-averaging images effectively eliminated these depth artifacts. These findings have implications for display design, content production, image quality studies, and stereoscopic games and software."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3496","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3497","fieldValue":"Baxter, John S H"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3497","fieldValue":"Khan, Ali R"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3497","fieldValue":"Peters, Terry M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3497","fieldValue":" The primary purpose of medical image visualization is to improve patient outcomes by facilitating the inspection, analysis, and interpretation of patient data. This is only possible if the usersâ\u20AC™ perceptual and cognitive limitations are taken into account during every step of design, implementation, and evaluation of interactive displays. Visualization of medical images, if executed effectively and efficiently, can empower physicians to explore patient data rapidly and accurately with minimal cognitive effort. This article describes a specific case study in biomedical visualization system design and evaluation, which is the visualization of MR angiography images for planning arteriovenous malformation (AVM) interventions. The success of an AVM intervention greatly depends on the surgeon gaining a full understanding of the anatomy of the malformation and its surrounding structures. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to investigate the usability of visualization modalities involving contour enhancement and stereopsis in the identification and localization of vascular structures using objective user studies. Our preliminary results indicate that contour enhancement, particularly when combined with stereopsis, results in improved performance enhancement of the perception of connectivity and relative depth between different structures."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3497","fieldValue":"Visual Enhancement of MR Angiography Images to Facilitate Planning of Arteriovenous Malformation Interventions"}
