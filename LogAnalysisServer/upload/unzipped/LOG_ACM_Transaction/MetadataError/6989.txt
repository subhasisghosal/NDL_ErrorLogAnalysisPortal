However, current standard DDRx DIMM memory interfaces are not well tailored to achieve high energy efficiency and performance in modern chip-multiprocessor-based computer systems. Their suboptimal performance and energy inefficiency can have a significant impact on system-wide efficiency since much of the system power dissipation is due to memory power. New memory interfaces, better suited for future many-core systems, are needed. In response, there are recent proposals to enhance the energy efficiency of main-memory systems by dividing a memory rank into subsets, and making a subset rather than a whole rank serve a memory request. We holistically assess the effectiveness of rank subsetting from system-wide performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability perspectives. We identify the impact of rank subsetting on memory power and processor performance analytically, compare two promising rank-subsetting proposals, Multicore DIMM and mini-rank, and verify our analysis by simulating a chip-multiprocessor system using multithreaded and consolidated workloads. We extend the design of Multicore DIMM for high-reliability systems and show that compared with conventional chipkill approaches, rank subsetting can lead to much higher system-level energy efficiency and performance at the cost of additional DRAM devices. This holistic assessment shows that rank subsetting offers compelling alternatives to existing processor-memory interfaces for future DDR systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1784","fieldValue":"DRAM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1784","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1784","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8764","fieldValue":"Lam, Shirley T C"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8764","fieldValue":"Chu, Hon-Wai"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8764","fieldValue":"Tsang, Danny H K"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8764","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
