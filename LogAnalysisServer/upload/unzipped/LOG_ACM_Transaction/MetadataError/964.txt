It weakens the usual notion of serializability by permitting controlled interleaving among transactions. It appears to be especially suitable for applications in which the set of transactions has a natural hierarchical structure based on the hierarchical structure of an organization. A characterization for multilevel atomicity, in terms of the absence of cycles in a dependency relation among transaction steps, is given. Some remarks are made concerning implementation."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13960","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13960","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/13961","fieldValue":" We describe and prove correct a programming technique using a linked list of pages for managing the free disk pages of a file system where shadowing is the recovery technique.

Watson Research Center. The EAS-E programming language is built around the entity, attribute, and set (EAS) view of application development. It provides a means for translating operations on EAS structures directly into executable code. EAS-E commands have an English-like syntax, and thus EAS-E programs are easy to read and understand. EAS-E programs are also more compact than equivalent programs in other database languages.The EAS-E database management system allows many users simultaneous access to the database. It supports locking and deadlock detection and is capable of efficiently supporting network databases of various sizes including very large databases, consisting of several millions of entities stored on multiple DASD extends. Also available is a nonprocedural facility that allows a user to browse and update the database without writing programs."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/13962","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/13962","fieldValue":"ACM"}
