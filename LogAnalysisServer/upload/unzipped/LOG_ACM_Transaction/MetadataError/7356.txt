Specifically, UPCF has the following attractive features. First, it supports multiple priority levels and guarantees that high-priority stations always join the polling list earlier than low-priority stations. Second, it provides fast reservation scheme such that associated stations with real-time traffic can get on the polling list in bounded time. Third, it employs dynamic channel time allocation scheme to support CBR\/VBR transportation and provide per-flow probabilistic bandwidth assurance. Fourth, it employs the power management techniques to let mobile stations save as much energy as possible. Fifth, it adopts the mobile-assisted admission control technique such that the point coordinator can admit as many newly flows as possible while not violating QoS guarantees made to already-admitted flows. The performance of UPCF is evaluated through both analysis and simulations. Simulation results do confirm that, as compared with the PCF in IEEE 802.11, UPCF not only provides higher goodput and energy throughput, but also achieves lower power consumption and frame loss due to delay expiry. Last but not least, we expect that UPCF can pass the current Wi-Fi certification and may coexist with the upcoming IEEE 802.11e standard."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9524","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9524","fieldValue":"UPCF: a new point coordination function with QoS and power management for multimedia over wireless LANs"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9524","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9524","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9525","fieldValue":"Tsaur, Lih-feng"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9525","fieldValue":" We present a closed-loop architecture and protocols for rapid dynamic spreading gain adaptation and fast feedback between a transmitter and a receiver communicating with each other in CDMA networks. These protocols and architecture do not require the transfer of an explicit control message indicating the change of CDMA spreading gain from transmitter to receiver. Also, with these protocols, the transmitter can change the spreading gain symbol-by-symbol as opposed to frame-by-frame, and feedback information (e.g., the fast-varying channel condition) can be exchanged almost as frequently as the symbol rate. Thus, adaptation to the time-varying channel conditions of wireless networks and\/or to the rate variation of traffic can be much faster than is possible with the existing frame-by-frame approach."}
