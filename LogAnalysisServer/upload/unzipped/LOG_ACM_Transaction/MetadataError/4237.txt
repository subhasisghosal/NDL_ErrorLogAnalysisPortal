{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23766","fieldValue":" Query-processing costs on large text databases are dominated by the need to retrieve and scan the inverted list of each query term. Retrieval time for inverted lists can be greatly reduced by the use of compression, but this adds to the CPU time required. Here we show that the CPU component of query response time for conjunctive Boolean queries and for informal ranked queries can be similarly reduced, at little cost in terms of storage, by the inclusion of an internal index in each compressed inverted list. This method has been applied in a retrieval system for a collection of nearly two million short documents. Our experimental results show that the self-indexing strategy adds less than 20% to the size of the compressed inverted file, which itself occupies less than 10% of the indexed text, yet can reduce processing time for Boolean queries of 5-10 terms to under one fifth of the previous cost. Similarly, ranked queries of 40-50 terms can be evaluated in as little as 25% of the previous time, with little or no loss of retrieval effectiveness."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23766","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23767","fieldValue":" The specification of an information system should include a description of structural system aspects as well as a description of the system behavior. In this article, we show how this can be achieved by high-level Petri netsâ\u20AC\u201Dnamely, the so-called NR\/T-nets (Nested-Relation\/Transition Nets). In NR\/T-nets, the structural part is modeled by nested relations, and the behavioral part is modeled by a novel Petri net formalism. Each place of a net represents a nested relation scheme, and the marking of each place is given as a nested relation of the respective type. Insert and delete operations in a nested relational database (NF2-database) are expressed by transitions in a net. These operations may operate not only on whole tuples of a given relation, but also on â\u20ACœsubtuplesâ\u20AC? of existing tuples. The arcs of a net are inscribed with so-called Filter Tables, which allow (together with an optional logical expression as transition inscription) conditions to be formulated on the specified (sub-) tuples. The occurrence rule for NR\/T-net transitions is defined by the operations union, intersection, and â\u20ACœnegativeâ\u20AC? in lattices of nested relations. The structure of an NR\/T-net, together with the occurrence rule, defines classes of possible information system procedures, i.e., sequences of (possibly concurrent) operations in an information system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23767","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23767","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23768","fieldValue":" Today's enterprises typically employ multiple information systems, which are independently developed, locally administered, and different in logical or physical designs. Therefore, a fundamental challenge in enterprise information management is the sharing of information for enterprise users across organizational boundaries; this requires a global query system capable of providing on-line intelligent assistance to users. Conventional technologies, such as schema-based query languages and hard-coded schema integration, are not sufficient to solve this problem. This article develops a new approach, a â\u20ACœmodel-assisted global query system,â\u20AC? that utilizes an on-line repository of enterprise metadataâ\u20AC\u201Dthe Metadatabaseâ\u20AC\u201Dto facilitate global query formulation and processing with certain desirable properties such as adaptiveness and open-systems architecture. A definitional model characterizing the various classes and roles of the required metadata as knowledge for the system is presented. The significance of possessing this knowledge (via a Metadatabase) toward improving the global query capabilities available previously is analyzed. On this basis, a direct method using model traversal and a query language using global model constructs are developed along with other new methods required for this approach. It is then tested through a prototype system in a computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) setting."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23768","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23768","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23769","fieldValue":"Author Index"}
