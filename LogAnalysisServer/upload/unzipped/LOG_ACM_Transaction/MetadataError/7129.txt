Loop-back is desirable to provide rapid preplanned recovery of link or node failures in a bandwidth-efficient distributed manner. We introduce generalized loop-back, a novel scheme for performing loop-back in optical mesh networks. We present an algorithm to perform recovery for link failure and one to perform generalized loop-back recovery for node failure. We illustrate the operation of both algorithms, prove their validity, and present a network management protocol algorithm, which enables distributed operation for link or node failure. We present three different applications of generalized loop-back. First, we present heuristic algorithms for selecting recovery graphs, which maintain short maximum and average lengths of recovery paths. Second, we present WDM-based loop-back recovery for optical networks where wavelengths are used to back up other wavelengths. We compare, for WDM-based loop-back, the operation of generalized loop-back operation with known ring-based ways of providing loop-back recovery over mesh networks. Finally, we introduce the use of generalized loop-back to provide recovery in a way that allows dynamic choice of routes over preplanned directions."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9083","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9083","fieldValue":"WDM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9083","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8343","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9084","fieldValue":" Many definitions of fairness for multicast networks assume that sessions are single rate, requiring that each multicast session transmits data to all of its receivers at the same rate. These definitions do not account for multirate approaches, such as layering, that permit receiving rates within a session to be chosen independently. We identify four desirable fairness properties for multicast networks, derived from properties that hold within the max-min fair allocations of unicast networks. We extend the definition of multicast max-min fairness to networks that contain multirate sessions, and show that all four fairness properties hold in a multirate max-min fair allocation, but need not hold in a single-rate max-min fair allocation. We then show that multirate max-min fair rate allocations can be achieved via intra-session coordinated joins and leaves of multicast groups. However, in the absence of coordination, the resulting max-min fair rate allocation uses link bandwidth inefficiently, and does not exhibit some of the desirable fairness properties. We evaluate this inefficiency for several layered multirate congestion control schemes, and find that, in a protocol where the sender coordinates joins, this inefficiency has minimal impact on desirable fairness properties. Our results indicate that sender-coordinated layered protocols show promise for achieving desirable fairness properties for allocations in large-scale multicast networks."}
