{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7763","fieldValue":" In recent decades, the frequency and intensity of natural disasters has increased significantly, and this trend is expected to continue. Therefore, understanding and predicting human behavior and mobility during a disaster will play a vital role in planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. However, such research is very difficult to perform owing to the uniqueness of various disasters and the unavailability of reliable and large-scale human mobility data. In this study, we collect big and heterogeneous data (e.g., GPS records of 1.6 million $users^1$ over 3 years, data on earthquakes that have occurred in Japan over 4 years, news report data, and transportation network data) to study human mobility following natural disasters. An empirical analysis is conducted to explore the basic laws governing human mobility following disasters, and an effective human mobility model is developed to predict and simulate population movements. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our model, and they suggest that human mobility following disasters can be significantly more predictable and be more easily simulated than previously thought."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7763","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7763","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7764","fieldValue":" We introduce a new supervised learning model using a discriminative regression approach. This new model estimates a regression vector to represent the similarity between a test example and training examples while seamlessly integrating the class information in the similarity estimation. This distinguishes our model from usual regression models and locally linear embedding approaches, rendering our method suitable for supervised learning problems in high-dimensional settings. Our model is easily extensible to account for nonlinear relationship and applicable to general data, including both high- and low-dimensional data. The objective function of the model is convex, for which two optimization algorithms are provided. These two optimization approaches induce two scalable solvers that are of mathematically provable, linear time complexity. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on various kinds of data. For example, our method shows comparable performance on low-dimensional data and superior performance on high-dimensional data to several widely used classifiers; also, the linear solvers obtain promising performance on large-scale classification."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7765","fieldValue":" We study the problem of detecting social communities when the social graph is not available but instead we have access to a log of user activity, that is, a dataset of tuples (u, i, t) recording the fact that user u â\u20ACœadoptedâ\u20AC? item i at time t. We propose a stochastic framework that assumes that the adoption of items is governed by an underlying diffusion process over the unobserved social network and that such a diffusion model is based on community-level influence. That is, we aim at modeling communities through the lenses of social contagion. By fitting the model parameters to the user activity log, we learn the community membership and the level of influence of each user in each community. The general framework is instantiated with two different diffusion models, one with discrete time and one with continuous time, and we show that the computational complexity of both approaches is linear in the number of users and in the size of the propagation log. Experiments on synthetic data with planted community structure show that our methods outperform non-trivial baselines. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is further validated on real-word data, on which our methods are able to detect high-quality communities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7765","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7765","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/7766","fieldValue":"Ho, Shan-Yuan"}
