Traditional security models that focused on separating users from each other have proven ineffective in an environment of widespread software vulnerabilities and rampant malware. However, alternative approaches that provide more finely grained security generally require greater expertise than typical end users can reasonably be expected to have, and consequently have had limited success. The functionality-based application confinement (FBAC) model is designed to allow end users with limited expertise to assign applications hierarchical and parameterised policy abstractions based upon the functionalities each program is intended to perform. To validate the feasibility of this approach and assess the usability of existing mechanisms, a usability study was conducted comparing an implementation of the FBAC model with the widely used Linux-based SELinux and AppArmor security schemes. The results showed that the functionality-based mechanism enabled end users to effectively control the privileges of their applications with far greater success than widely used alternatives. In particular, policies created using FBAC were more likely to be enforced and exhibited significantly lower risk exposure, while not interfering with the ability of the application to perform its intended task. In addition to the success of the functionality-based approach, the usability study also highlighted a number of limitations and problems with existing mechanisms. These results indicate that a functionality-based approach has significant potential in terms of enabling end users with limited expertise to defend themselves against insecure and malicious software."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22336","fieldValue":"FBAC-LSM"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22336","fieldValue":"POLA"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/22336","fieldValue":"Empowering End Users to Confine Their Own Applications: The Results of a Usability Study Comparing SELinux, AppArmor, and FBAC-LSM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/22336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/22336","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/3131","fieldValue":"Nguyen, Long H B"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3131","fieldValue":" Manually constructing an annotated Named Entity (NE) in a bilingual corpus is a time-consuming, labor--intensive, and expensive process, but this is necessary for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as cross-lingual information retrieval, cross-lingual information extraction, machine translation, etc. In this article, we present an automatic approach to construct an annotated NE in English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus from a bilingual parallel corpus by proposing an aligned NE method. Basing this corpus on a bilingual corpus in which the initial NEs are extracted from its own language separately, the approach tries to correct unrecognized NEs or incorrectly recognized NEs before aligning the NEs by using a variety of bilingual constraints. The generated corpus not only improves the NE recognition results but also creates alignments between English NEs and Vietnamese NEs, which are necessary for training NE translation models. The experimental results show that the approach outperforms the baseline methods effectively. In the English-Vietnamese NE alignment task, the F-measure increases from 68.58% to 79.77%. Thanks to the improvement of the NE recognition quality, the proposed method also increases significantly: the F-measure goes from 84.85% to 88.66% for the English side and from 75.71% to 85.55% for the Vietnamese side. By providing the additional semantic information for the machine translation systems, the BLEU score increases from 33.04% to 45.11%."}
