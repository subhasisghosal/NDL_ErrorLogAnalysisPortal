{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25561","fieldValue":" Peer-to-peer live streaming applications are vulnerable to malicious actions of peers that deliberately modify data to decrease or prevent the fruition of the media (pollution attack). In this article we propose DIP, a fully distributed, accurate, and robust algorithm for the identification of polluters. DIP relies on checks that are computed by peers upon completing reception of all blocks composing a data chunk. A check is a special message that contains the set of peer identifiers that provided blocks of the chunk as well as a bit to signal if the chunk has been corrupted. Checks are periodically transmitted by peers to their neighbors in the overlay network; peers receiving checks use them to maintain a factor graph. This graph is bipartite and an incremental belief propagation algorithm is run on it to compute the probability of a peer being a polluter. Using a prototype deployed over PlanetLab we show by extensive experimentation that DIP allows honest peers to identify polluters with very high accuracy and completeness, even when polluters collude to deceive them. Furthermore, we show that DIP is efficient, requiring low computational, communication, and storage overhead at each peer."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25561","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25562","fieldValue":" This article proposes a novel energy-efficient multimedia delivery system called EStreamer. First, we study the relationship between buffer size at the client, burst-shaped TCP-based multimedia traffic, and energy consumption of wireless network interfaces in smartphones. Based on the study, we design and implement EStreamer for constant bit rate and rate-adaptive streaming. EStreamer can improve battery lifetime by 3x, 1.5x, and 2x while streaming over Wi-Fi, 3G, and 4G, respectively."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25562","fieldValue":"DASH"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25562","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25563","fieldValue":"Zhao, Wan-Lei"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/25563","fieldValue":"Ngo, Chong-Wah"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25563","fieldValue":" In this article, we propose a novel Hamming embedding kernel with informative bag-of-visual words to address two main problems existing in traditional BoW approaches for video semantic indexing. First, Hamming embedding is employed to alleviate the information loss caused by SIFT quantization. The Hamming distances between keypoints in the same cell are calculated and integrated into the SVM kernel to better discriminate different image samples. Second, to highlight the concept-specific visual information, we propose to weight the visual words according to their informativeness for detecting specific concepts. We show that our proposed kernels can significantly improve the performance of concept detection."}
