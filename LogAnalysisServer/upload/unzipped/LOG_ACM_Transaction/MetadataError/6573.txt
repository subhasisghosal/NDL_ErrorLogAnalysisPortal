Traditionally, reliable memory systems have been implemented using coded storage techniques, such as ECC. While these designs can effectively detect and correct memory faults such as transient errors and single-bit defects, their use bears a significant cost overhead. In this article, we propose a novel partial memory protection scheme that provides high-coverage fault protection for program code and data, but with much lower cost than traditional approaches. Our approach profiles program code and data usage to assess which program elements are most critical to maintaining program correctness. Critical code and variables are then placed into a limited protected storage resources. To ensure high coverage of program elements, our placement technique considers all program components simultaneously, including code, global variables, stack frames, and heap variables. The fault coverage of our approach is gauged using Monte Carlo fault-injection experiments, which confirm that our technique provides high levels of fault protection (99&percnt; coverage) with limited memory protection resources (36&percnt; protected area)."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1683","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1683","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7515","fieldValue":" Fine-grained localization is extremely important to accurately locate a user indoors. Although innovative solutions have already been proposed, there is no solution that is universally accepted, easily implemented, user centric, and, most importantly, works in the absence of GSM coverage or WiFi availability. The advent of sensor rich smartphones has paved a way to develop a solution that can cater to these requirements. By employing a smartphone's built-in magnetic field sensor, magnetic signatures were collected inside buildings. These signatures displayed a uniqueness in their patterns due to the presence of different kinds of pillars, doors, elevators, etc., that consist of ferromagnetic materials like steel or iron. We theoretically analyze the cause of this uniqueness and then present an indoor localization solution by classifying signatures based on their patterns. However, to account for user walking speed variations so as to provide an application usable to a variety of users, we follow a dynamic time-warping-based approach that is known to work on similar signals irrespective of their variations in the time axis. Our approach resulted in localization distances of approximately 2m--6m with accuracies between 80--100&percnt; implying that it is sufficient to walk short distances across hallways to be located by the smartphone. The implementation of the application on different smartphones yielded response times of less than five secs, thereby validating the feasibility of our approach and making it a viable solution."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7515","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7516","fieldValue":" Event coreference is an important task in event extraction and other natural language processing tasks. Despite its importance, it was merely discussed in previous studies. In this article, we present a global coreference resolution system dedicated to various sophisticated event coreference phenomena. First, seven resolvers are utilized to resolve different event and object coreference mention pairs with a new instance selection strategy and new linguistic features. Second, a global solutionâ\u20AC\u201Da modified random walk partitioningâ\u20AC\u201Dis employed for the chain formation. Being the first attempt to apply the random walk model for coreference resolution, the revised model utilizes a sampling method, termination criterion, and stopping probability to greatly improve the effectiveness of random walk model for event coreference resolution. Last but not least, the new model facilitates a convenient way to incorporate sophisticated linguistic constraints and preferences, the related object mention graph, as well as pronoun coreference information not used in previous studies for effective chain formation. In total, these techniques impose more than 20&percnt; F-score improvement over the baseline system."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7516","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7516","fieldValue":"ACM"}
