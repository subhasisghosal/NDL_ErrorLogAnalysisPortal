{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10506","fieldValue":" BitTorrent is the most popular peer-to-peer (P2P) content delivery application where individual users share various types of content with tens of thousands of other users. The growing popularity of BitTorrent is primarily due to the availability of valuable content without any cost for the consumers. However, apart from the required resources, publishing valuable (and often copyrighted) content has serious legal implications for the users who publish the material. This raises the question that whether (at least major) content publishers behave in an altruistic fashion or have other motives such as financial incentives. In this paper, we identify the content publishers of more than 55 K torrents in two major BitTorrent portals and examine their characteristics. We discover that around 100 publishers are responsible for publishing 67% of the content, which corresponds to 75% of the downloads. Our investigation reveals several key insights about major publishers. First, antipiracy agencies and malicious users publish \"fake\" files to protect copyrighted content and spread malware, respectively. Second, excluding the fake publishers, content publishing in major BitTorrent portals appears to be largely driven by companies that try to attract consumers to their own Web sites for financial gain. Finally, we demonstrate that profit-driven publishers attract more loyal consumers than altruistic top publishers, whereas the latter have a larger fraction of loyal consumers with a higher degree of loyalty than the former."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10506","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10506","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10507","fieldValue":"Gatmir-Motahari, Sara"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10507","fieldValue":" Many of today's applications such as cellular network management, prediction and control of the spread of biological and mobile viruses, etc., depend on the modeling and prediction of human locations. However, having widespread wireless localization technology, such as pervasive cell-tower\/GPS location estimation available for only the last few years, many factors that impact human mobility patterns remain under researched. Further more, many industries including telecom providers are still in need of low-cost and simple location\/place prediction methods that can be implemented on a large scale. In this paper, we focus on \"temporal factors\" and demonstrate that they significantly impact randomness, size, and probability distribution of people's movements. We also use this information to make simple and inexpensive prediction models for subscribers' visited places. We monitored individuals for a month and divided days and hours into segments for each user to obtain probability distribution of their places for each segment of time intervals and observed major improvement in future \"time-based\" predictions of their location compared to when temporal factors were not considered. In addition to quantifying the improvement in place prediction, we show that significant improvements can actually be achieved through an intuitive division of time intervals with no added computational complexity."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10507","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10507","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10507","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10508","fieldValue":" To meet the capacity demands from ever-increasing mobile data usage, mobile network operators are moving toward smaller cell structures. These small cells, called femtocells, use sophisticated air interface technologies such as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). While femtocells are expected to provide numerous benefits such as energy efficiency and better throughput, the interference resulting from their dense deployments prevents such benefits from being harnessed in practice. Thus, there is an evident need for a resource management solution to mitigate the interference that occurs between collocated femtocells. In this paper, we design and implement one of the first resource management systems, FERMI, for OFDMA-based femtocell networks. As part of its design, FERMI: 1) provides resource isolation in the frequency domain (as opposed to time) to leverage power pooling across cells to improve capacity; 2) uses measurement-driven triggers to intelligently distinguish clients that require just link adaptation from those that require resource isolation; 3) incorporates mechanisms that enable the joint scheduling of both types of clients in the same frame; and 4) employs efficient, scalable algorithms to determine a fair resource allocation across the entire network with high utilization and low overhead. We implement FERMI on a prototype four-cell WiMAX femtocell testbed and show that it yields significant gains over conventional approaches."}
