The present contour model is formulated by translating the Fujisaki model, a well-founded mathematical model representing the control mechanism of vocal fold vibration, into a probabilistic model described as a discrete-time stochastic process. There are two motivations behind this formulation. One is to derive a general parameter estimation framework for the Fujisaki model that allows the introduction of powerful statistical methods. The other is to construct an automatically trainable version of the Fujisaki model that we can incorporate into statistical-model-based text-to-speech synthesizers in such a way that the Fujisaki-model parameters can be learned from a speech corpus in a unified manner. It could also be useful for other speech applications such as emotion recognition, speaker identification, speech conversion and dialogue systems, in which prosodic information plays a significant role. We quantitatively evaluated the performance of the proposed Fujisaki model parameter extractor using real speech data. Experimental results revealed that our method was superior to a state-of-the-art Fujisaki model parameter extractor."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3934","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3935","fieldValue":" A soundfield image is a data structure that efficiently encodes and represents the wave field as captured by a microphone array. Its representation is based on the directional plenacoustic function, which is defined as the radiance of the acoustic paths (rays) that cross the segment that the array lies upon. The soundfield image can be processed \"as is\" to develop a variety of applications. In its original formulation, the soundfield image is based on a Euclidean parameterization that can accommodate a limited range of rays and is suitable for managing a single array only. In this paper, we generalize this methodology to the case of multiple microphone arrays deployed in space. The use of multiple arrays allows us to capture truly global information on the sound field but requires us to rethink the ray space, and adopt a global representation of the acoustic rays based on projective geometry. After introducing the new parameterization, we present two examples of applications: the estimation of the mutual poses of two or more arrays (self-calibration); and the localization of multiple acoustic sources. The effectiveness of these applications is proven through simulations as well as real data experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3935","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/3935","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/3936","fieldValue":" This paper presents a novel sampling scheme on the sphere for obtaining head-related transfer function (HRTF) measurements and accurately computing the spherical harmonic transform (SHT). The scheme requires an optimal number of samples, given by the degrees of freedom in the spectral domain, for the accurate representation of the HRTF that is band-limited in the spherical harmonic domain. The proposed scheme allows for the samples to be easily taken over the sphere due to its iso-latitude structure and non-dense sampling near the poles. In addition, the scheme can be used when samples are not taken from the south polar cap region of the sphere as the HRTF measurements are not reliable in south polar cap region due to reflections from the ground. Furthermore, the scheme has a hierarchical structure, which enables the HRTF to be analyzed at different audible frequencies using the same sampling configuration. In comparison to the proposed scheme, none of the other sampling schemes on the sphere simultaneously possess all these properties. We conduct several numerical experiments to determine the accuracy of the SHT associated with the proposed sampling scheme. We show that the SHT attains accuracy on the order of numerical precision $(10^-14) when samples are taken over the whole sphere, both in the optimal sample placement and hierarchical configurations, and achieves an acceptable level of accuracy (10-5$) when samples are not taken over the south polar cap region of the sphere for the band-limits of interest. Simulations are used to show the accurate reconstruction of the HRTF over the whole sphere, including unmeasured locations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/3936","fieldValue":"ACM"}
