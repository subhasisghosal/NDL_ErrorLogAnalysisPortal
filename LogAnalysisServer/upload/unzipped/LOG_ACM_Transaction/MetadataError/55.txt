{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11134","fieldValue":" This article describes an outreach program to broaden participation in computing to include more students with visual impairments. The precollege workshops target students in grades 7--12 and engage students with robotics programming. The use of robotics at the precollege level has become popular in part due to the availability of Lego Mindstorm NXT kits. The robotics programming tools and materials used in the workshops are designed with an accessibility focus for participants with different degrees of vision. Through the use of available assistive technology and open source software, robotics is accessible to the visually impaired. The quantitative and qualitative results from three robotics workshops conducted during the past three years will be discussed, including some initial long-term results. Strategies, based on our experiences, will also be shared to promote accessible outreach. While many of the participants are in middle and early high school, findings indicate that participant interest in computing is high regardless of whether their schools offer computer science courses or not. Increased interest and confidence with robotics persists throughout follow-up activities."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11134","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11134","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11135","fieldValue":"McCartney, Robert"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11135","fieldValue":" The goal of this editorial is to both encourage authors to continue to submit articles describing computational tools for computing education to TOCE, and to make explicit our expectations as the editors of TOCE for what makes a good â\u20ACœtoolsâ\u20AC? article. We elaborate three key criteria, and provide examples from previous TOCE papers that satisfy these criteria: 1) establish that the tool is related essentially to computing education, 2) make explicit claims about the impact of the tool on learning, and 3) evidence these claims through actual use."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11135","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/11135","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/11136","fieldValue":"Miller, Craig S"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/11136","fieldValue":" Specifying file references for hypertext links is an elementary competence that nevertheless draws upon core computational thinking concepts such as tree traversal and the distinction between relative and absolute references. In this article we explore the learning effects of different instructional strategies in the context of an introductory computing course. Results suggest that asking students to do targeted tasks, albeit supported with working examples, is not the best preparation. Instead, unstructured study of examples produces superior learning. Answering targeted conceptual questions can also yield comparably positive learning but only in qualified contexts. While perhaps unintuitive, these results are consistent with a long line of research on human cognition and learning. We discuss our results in the context of this previous research and recommend effective instructional strategies, which may apply to a broad range of computational concepts."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/11136","fieldValue":"ACM"}
