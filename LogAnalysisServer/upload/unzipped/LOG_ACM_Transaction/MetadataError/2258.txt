Our choice of input is motivated by the observation that traditional cartoon characters are well approximated by a union of generalized surface of revolution body parts, anchored by a skeletal structure. While typical 2D character contour drawings allow ambiguities in 3D interpretation, our use of a 3D skeleton eliminates such ambiguities and enables the construction of believable character canvases from complex drawings. Our canvases conform to the 2D contours of the input drawings, and are consistent with the perceptual principles of Gestalt continuity, simplicity, and contour persistence. We first segment the input 2D contours into individual body-part outlines corresponding to 3D skeletal bones using the Gestalt continuation principle to correctly resolve inter-part occlusions in the drawings. We then use this segmentation to compute the canvas geometry, generating 3D generalized surfaces of revolution around the skeletal bones that conform to the original outlines and balance simplicity against contour persistence. The combined method generates believable canvases for characters drawn in complex poses with numerous inter-part occlusions, variable contour depth, and significant foreshortening. Our canvases serve as 3D geometric proxies for cartoon characters, enabling unconstrained 3D viewing, articulation, and non-photorealistic rendering. We validate our algorithm via a range of user studies and comparisons to ground-truth 3D models and artist-drawn results. We further demonstrate a compelling gallery of 3D character canvases created from a diverse set of cartoon drawings with matching 3D skeletons."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17494","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17494","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17495","fieldValue":" Photographers often â\u20ACœprepâ\u20AC? their subjects to achieve various effects; for example, toning down overly shiny skin, covering blotches, etc. Making such adjustments digitally after a shoot is possible, but difficult without good tools and good skills. Making such adjustments to video footage is harder still. We describe and study a set of 2D image operations, based on multiscale image analysis, that are easy and straightforward and that can consistently modify perceived material properties. These operators first build a subband decomposition of the image and then selectively modify the coefficients within the subbands. We call this selection process band sifting. We show that different siftings of the coefficients can be used to modify the appearance of properties such as gloss, smoothness, pigmentation, or weathering. The band-sifting operators have particularly striking effects when applied to faces; they can provide â\u20ACœknobsâ\u20AC? to make a face look wetter or drier, younger or older, and with heavy or light variation in pigmentation. Through user studies, we identify a set of operators that yield consistent subjective effects for a variety of materials and scenes. We demonstrate that these operators are also useful for processing video sequences."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17495","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/2655","fieldValue":"Avigdor-Elgrabli, Noa"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2655","fieldValue":" We design and analyze an online reordering buffer management algorithm with improved O(logâ\u20AC\u2030k\/logâ\u20AC\u2030logâ\u20AC\u2030k) competitive ratio for nonuniform costs, where k is the buffer size.
