It has an extendable architecture with a uniform C++ layer which can be used with any suitably prepared MP type. The system implements many high-precision special functions and extends some of these to very large parameter ranges. It supports calculations with 30 &ctdot; 300 decimal digits of precision. Interoperabilities with Microsoftâ\u20AC™sÂ® CLR, Python, and MathematicaÂ® are supported. The e_float system and its usage are described in detail. Implementation notes, testing results, and performance measurements are provided."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19301","fieldValue":"C++"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2867","fieldValue":" Temporal information plays an important role in natural language processing (NLP) applications such as information extraction, discourse analysis, automatic summarization, and question-answering. In the topic detection and tracking (TDT) area, the temporal information often used is the publication date of a message, which is readily available but limited in its usefulness. We developed a relatively simple NLP method for extracting temporal information from Korean news articles, with the goal of improving performance of TDT tasks. To extract temporal information, we make use of finite state automata and a lexicon containing timerevealing vocabulary. Extracted information is converted into a canonicalized representation of a time point or a time duration. We first evaluated and investigated the extraction and canonicalization methods for their accuracy and the extent to which temporal information extracted as such can help TDT tasks. The experimental results show that time information extracted from the text does indeed help to significantly improve both precision and recall."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2867","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2867","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19302","fieldValue":"Smith, David M"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19302","fieldValue":" This article describes a collection of Fortran-95 routines for evaluating the exponential integral function, error function, sine and cosine integrals, Fresnel integrals, Bessel functions, and related mathematical special functions using the FM multiple-precision arithmetic package."}
