The solver implements Newton‚\u20ACôs method in function space, where instead of the usual Jacobian matrices, the derivatives involved are Fr√©chet derivatives. A major novelty of this approach is the application of automatic differentiation (AD) techniques to compute the operator-valued Fr√©chet derivatives in the continuous context. Other novelties include the use of anonymous functions and numbering of each variable to enable a recursive, delayed evaluation of derivatives with forward mode AD . The AD techniques are applied within a new Chebfun class called which allows users to set up and solve nonlinear BVPs, both scalar and systems of coupled equations, in a few lines of code, using the ‚\u20ACúnonlinear backslash‚\u20AC? operator (\\). This framework enables one to study the behaviour of Newton‚\u20ACôs method in function space."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"ERR_FOUND_HTML_TAG","handle":"12345678_acm\/19329","fieldValue":"Newton&rsquo;s method in function space"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19329","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19329","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19330","fieldValue":" SFSDP is a Matlab package for solving sensor network localization (SNL) problems. These types of problems arise in monitoring and controlling applications using wireless sensor networks. SFSDP implements the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation proposed in Kim et al. [2009] for sensor network localization problems, as a sparse version of the full semidefinite programming relaxation (FSDP) by Biswas and Ye [2004]. To improve the efficiency of FSDP, SFSDP exploits the aggregated and correlative sparsity of a sensor network localization problem. As a result, SFSDP can handle much larger problems than other software as well as three-dimensional anchor-free problems. SFSDP analyzes the input data of a sensor network localization problem, solves the problem, and displays the computed locations of sensors. SFSDP also includes the features of generating test problems for numerical experiments."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19330","fieldValue":"Algorithm 920: SFSDP: A Sparse Version of Full Semidefinite Programming Relaxation for Sensor Network Localization Problems"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/19330","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/19330","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/19331","fieldValue":"Hauenstein, Jonathan D"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/19331","fieldValue":" Smale‚\u20ACôs Œ±-theory uses estimates related to the convergence of Newton‚\u20ACôs method to certify that Newton iterations will converge quadratically to solutions to a square polynomial system.
