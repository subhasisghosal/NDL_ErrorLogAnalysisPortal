We demonstrate how the novelty of newly published content plays an important role in affecting its popularity. More specifically, we study three dimensions of novelty. The first one, termed contemporaneous novelty, models the relative novelty embedded in a new post with respect to contemporary content that was generated by others. The second type of novelty, termed self novelty, models the relative novelty with respect to the userâ\u20AC™s own contribution history. The third type of novelty, termed discussion novelty, relates to the novelty of the comments associated by readers with respect to the post content. We demonstrate the contribution of the new novelty measures to estimating blog-post popularity by predicting the number of comments expected for a fresh post. We further demonstrate how novelty based measures can be utilized for predicting the citation volume of academic papers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7434","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7435","fieldValue":" Wikipedia is the largest user-generated knowledge base. We propose a structured query mechanism, entity-relationship query, for searching entities in the Wikipedia corpus by their properties and interrelationships. An entity-relationship query consists of multiple predicates on desired entities. The semantics of each predicate is specified with keywords. Entity-relationship query searches entities directly over text instead of preextracted structured data stores. This characteristic brings two benefits: (1) Query semantics can be intuitively expressed by keywords; (2) It only requires rudimentary entity annotation, which is simpler than explicitly extracting and reasoning about complex semantic information before query-time. We present a ranking framework for general entity-relationship queries and a position-based Bounded Cumulative Model (BCM) for accurate ranking of query answers. We also explore various weighting schemes for further improving the accuracy of BCM. We test our ideas on a 2008 version of Wikipedia using a collection of 45 queries pooled from INEX entity ranking track and our own crafted queries. Experiments show that the ranking and weighting schemes are both effective, particularly on multipredicate queries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7435","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7435","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7436","fieldValue":" Wikipedia, one of the best-known wikis and the worldâ\u20AC™s largest free online encyclopedia, has embraced the power of collaborative editing to harness collective intelligence. However, using such a wiki to create high-quality articles is not as easy as people imagine, given for instance the difficulty of reusing knowledge already available in Wikipedia. As a result, the heavy burden of upbuilding and maintaining the ever-growing online encyclopedia still rests on a small group of people. In this article, we aim at facilitating wiki authoring by providing annotation recommendations, thus lightening the burden of both contributors and administrators. We leverage the collective wisdom of the users by exploiting Semantic Web technologies with Wikipedia data and adopt a unified algorithm to support link, category, and semantic relation recommendation. A prototype system named EachWiki is proposed and evaluated. The experimental results show that it has achieved considerable improvements in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and usability. The proposed approach can also be applied to other wiki-based collaborative editing systems."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7436","fieldValue":"ACM"}
