In this article we present two external memory index structures for the efficient retrieval of records stored on the local flash memory of a WSD. Our index structures, MicroHash and MicroGF (micro grid files), exploit the asymmetric read\/write and wear characteristics of flash memory in order to offer high-performance indexing and searching capabilities in the presence of a low-energy budget, which is typical for the devices under discussion. Both structures organize data and index pages on the flash media using a sorted by timestamp file organization. A key idea behind these index structures is that expensive random access deletions are completely eliminated. MicroHash enables equality searches by value in constant time and equality searches by timestamp in logarithmic time at a small cost of storing index pages on the flash media. Similarly, MicroGF enables spatial equality and proximity searches in constant time. We have implemented these index structures in nesC, the programming language of the TinyOS operating system. Our trace-driven experimentation with several real datasets reveals that our index structures offer excellent search performance at a small cost of constructing and maintaining the index."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20937","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/20938","fieldValue":" The RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) system has been widely used in practical storage applications for better performance, cost effectiveness, and reliability. This study proposes a novel variant of RAID named Zoned-RAID (Z-RAID). Z-RAID improves the performance of traditional RAID by utilizing the zoning property of modern disks which provides multiple zones with different data transfer rates within a disk. Z-RAID levels 1, 5, and 6 are introduced to enhance the effective data transfer rate of RAID levels 1, 5, and 6, respectively, by constraining the placement of data blocks in multizone disks. We apply the Z-RAID to a practical and popular application, streaming media server, that requires a high-data transfer rate as well as a high reliability. The analytical and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Z-RAID to conventional RAID. Z-RAID provides a higher effective data transfer rate in normal mode with no disadvantage. In the presence of a disk failure, Z-RAID still performs as well as RAID."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20938","fieldValue":"RAID"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/20938","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/20938","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/1219","fieldValue":"Vu, Le-Hung"}
