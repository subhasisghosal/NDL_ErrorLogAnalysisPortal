In particular, we study revenue-maximizing mechanisms in Bayesian settings for facility location problems on graphs where no agent can be excluded from using a facility that has been constructed. We show that the pointwise optimization problem involved in implementing the revenue optimal mechanism, namely, optimizing over arbitrary profiles of virtual values, is hard to approximate within a factor of $Î©(n^2-Îµ$) (assuming P&neq; NP) even in star graphs. Furthermore, we show that optimizing the expected revenue is APX-hard. However, in a relevant special case, rooted version with identical distributions, we construct polynomial time truthful mechanisms that approximate the optimal expected revenue within a constant factor. We also study the effect of partially mitigating nonexcludability by collecting tolls for using the facilities. We show that such â\u20ACœposted-priceâ\u20AC? mechanisms obtain significantly higher revenue and often approach the optimal revenue obtainable with full excludability."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6040","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6040","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6041","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of designing incentive-compatible, ex-post individually rational (IR) mechanisms for covering problems in the Bayesian setting, where players' types are drawn from an underlying distribution and may be correlated, and the goal is to minimize the expected total payment made by the mechanism. We formulate a notion of incentive compatibility (IC) that we call support-based IC that is substantially more robust than Bayesian IC, and develop black-box reductions from support-based-IC mechanism design to algorithm design. For single-dimensional settings, this black-box reduction applies even when we only have an LP-relative approximation algorithm for the algorithmic problem. Thus, we obtain near-optimal mechanisms for various covering settings, including single-dimensional covering problems, multi-item procurement auctions, and multidimensional facility location."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6041","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6041","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6042","fieldValue":" In this work, we investigate the reasons that make symmetric partial verification essentially useless in virtually all domains. Departing from previous work, we consider any possible (finite or infinite) domain and general symmetric verification. We identify a natural property, namely, that the correspondence graph of a symmetric verification M is strongly connected by finite paths along which the preferences are consistent with the preferences at the endpoints, and prove that this property is sufficient for the equivalence of truthfulness and M-truthfulness. In fact, defining appropriate versions of this property, we obtain this result for deterministic and randomized mechanisms with and without money. Moreover, we show that a slightly relaxed version of this property is also necessary for the equivalence of truthfulness and M-truthfulness. Our conditions provide a generic and convenient way of checking whether truthful implementation can take advantage of any symmetric verification scheme in any (finite or infinite) domain. Since the simplest symmetric verification is the local verification, specific cases of our result are closely related, in the case without money, to the research about the equivalence of local truthfulness and global truthfulness. To complete the picture, we consider asymmetric verification and prove that a social choice function is M-truthfully implementable by some asymmetric verification M if and only if f does not admit a cycle of profitable deviations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6042","fieldValue":"ACM"}
