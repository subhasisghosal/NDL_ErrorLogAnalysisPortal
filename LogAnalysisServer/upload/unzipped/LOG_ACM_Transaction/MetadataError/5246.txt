One such epigenetic alteration is aberrant methylation of gene promoter-related CpG islands, where hypermethylation frequently results in transcriptional inactivation of target genes, while a decrease or loss of promoter methylation (hypomethylation) is frequently associated with transcriptional activation. Discovering genes with these relationships in NHL or other types of cancers could lead to a better understanding of the pathobiology of these diseases. The simultaneous analysis of promoter methylation using Differential Methylation Hybridization (DMH) and its associated gene expression using Expressed CpG Island Sequence Tag (ECIST) microarrays generates a large volume of methylation-expression relational data. To analyze this data, we propose a set of algorithms based on fuzzy sets theory, in particular Possibilistic c-Means (PCM) and cluster fuzzy density. For each gene, these algorithms calculate measures of confidence of various methylation-expression relationships in each NHL subclass. Thus, these tools can be used as a means of high volume data exploration to better guide biological confirmation using independent molecular biology methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4285","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4285","fieldValue":"Relational Analysis of CpG Islands Methylation and Gene Expression in Human Lymphomas Using Possibilistic C-Means Clustering and Modified Cluster Fuzzy Density"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4285","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4285","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4286","fieldValue":" Microarray technology has generated vast amounts of gene expression data with distinct patterns. Based on the premise that genes of correlated functions tend to exhibit similar expression patterns, various machine learning methods have been applied to capture these specific patterns in microarray data. However, the discrepancy between the rich expression profiles and the limited knowledge of gene functions has been a major hurdle to the understanding of cellular networks. To bridge this gap so as to properly comprehend and interpret expression data, we introduce Relevance Feedback to microarray analysis and propose an interactive learning framework to incorporate the expert knowledge into the decision module. In order to find a good learning method and solve two intrinsic problems in microarray data, high dimensionality and small sample size, we also propose a semisupervised learning algorithm: Kernel Discriminant-EM (KDEM). This algorithm efficiently utilizes a large set of unlabeled data to compensate for the insufficiency of a small set of labeled data and it extends the linear algorithm in Discriminant-EM (DEM) to a kernel algorithm to handle nonlinearly separable data in a lower dimensional space. The Relevance Feedback technique and KDEM together construct an efficient and effective interactive semisupervised learning framework for microarray analysis. Extensive experiments on the yeast cell cycle regulation data set and Plasmodium falciparum red blood cell cycle data set show the promise of this approach."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4286","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4286","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4286","fieldValue":"ACM"}
