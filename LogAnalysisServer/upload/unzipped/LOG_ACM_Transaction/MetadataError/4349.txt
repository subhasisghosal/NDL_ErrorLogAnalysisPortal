{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24050","fieldValue":" Peer-to-peer technology is widely used for file sharing. In the past decade a number of prototype peer-to-peer information retrieval systems have been developed. Unfortunately, none of these has seen widespread real-world adoption and thus, in contrast with file sharing, information retrieval is still dominated by centralized solutions. In this article we provide an overview of the key challenges for peer-to-peer information retrieval and the work done so far. We want to stimulate and inspire further research to overcome these challenges. This will open the door to the development and large-scale deployment of real-world peer-to-peer information retrieval systems that rival existing centralized client-server solutions in terms of scalability, performance, user satisfaction, and freedom."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24050","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24050","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24051","fieldValue":"Harper, F Maxwell"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/24051","fieldValue":"Konstan, Joseph A"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24051","fieldValue":" Community Question Answering (CQA) services enable their users to exchange knowledge in the form of questions and answers. These communities thrive as a result of a small number of highly active users, typically called experts, who provide a large number of high-quality useful answers. Expert identification techniques enable community managers to take measures to retain the experts in the community. There is further value in identifying the experts during the first few weeks of their participation as it would allow measures to nurture and retain them. In this article we address two problems: (a) How to identify current experts in CQA? and (b) How to identify users who have potential of becoming experts in future (potential experts)? In particular, we propose a probabilistic model that captures the selection preferences of users based on the questions they choose for answering. The probabilistic model allows us to run machine learning methods for identifying experts and potential experts. Our results over several popular CQA datasets indicate that experts differ considerably from ordinary users in their selection preferences; enabling us to predict experts with higher accuracy over several baseline models. We show that selection preferences can be combined with baseline measures to improve the predictive performance even further."}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24051","fieldValue":"Exploring Question Selection Bias to Identify Experts and Potential Experts in Community Question Answering"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/24051","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/24051","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/24052","fieldValue":" Predicting query performance, that is, the effectiveness of a search performed in response to a query, is a highly important and challenging problem. We present a novel approach to this task that is based on measuring the standard deviation of retrieval scores in the result list of the documents most highly ranked. We argue that for retrieval methods that are based on document-query surface-level similarities, the standard deviation can serve as a surrogate for estimating the presumed amount of query drift in the result list, that is, the presence (and dominance) of aspects or topics not related to the query in documents in the list. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the prediction effectiveness of our approach for several retrieval models. Specifically, the prediction quality often transcends that of current state-of-the-art prediction methods."}
