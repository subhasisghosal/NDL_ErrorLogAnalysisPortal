Most of prior research separately analyzes the meanings of the qualitative or quantitative features, and does not consider the categorical information when clustering financial reports. Since quantitative or qualitative features contain only partial information, there may be no synergy by considering them individually. It is more appropriate to predict stock price movements by simultaneously taking both quantitative and qualitative features into account. Therefore, in this study, we utilize a weighting scheme to combine both qualitative and quantitative features of financial reports together, and propose a method to predict short-term stock price movements. The proposed method employs the categorical information to localize the clusters and improve the purity of each resultant cluster. We gathered 26,255 reports of companies listed in the S&P 500 index from the EDGAR database and conducted the GICS (Global Industrial Classification System) experiments based on the industry sectors. The empirical evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms the SVM, na√Øve Bayes, and PFHC methods in terms of accuracy and average profit."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8154","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/8154","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/8154","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8105","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/8155","fieldValue":"Nunamaker Jr, Jay F."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8155","fieldValue":" In December of 2009, several founders of the Information Systems (IS) academic discipline gathered for a panel discussion at the International Conference on Information Systems to present their visions for the future of the field, and their comments were summarized in the inaugural issue of TMIS [Davis et al., 2010; J. F. J. Nunamaker et al., 1991]. To assure a robust future, they argued, IS journals, conferences, reviewers, promotion committees, teachers, researchers, and curriculum developers must broaden the scope of IS. This article explores the need for a broader vision to drive future development of the IS discipline."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/8155","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
