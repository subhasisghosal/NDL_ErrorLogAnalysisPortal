The model permits both positive and negative authorizations and supports exceptions at the same time. The model is flexible in that the users can specify, for each authorization they grant, whether the authorization can allow for exceptions or whether it must be strongly obeyed. It provides authorization management for groups with exceptions at any level of the group hierarchy, and temporary suspension of authorizations. The model supports ownership together with decentralized administration of authorizations. Administrative privileges can also be restricted so that owners retain control over their tables."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23802","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23802","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23803","fieldValue":" Two recently implemented machine-learning algorithms, RIPPERand sleeping-experts for phrases, are evaluated on a number of large text categorization problems. These algorithms both construct classifiers that allow the â\u20ACœcontextâ\u20AC? of a word w to affect how (or even whether) the presence or absence of w will contribute to a classification. However, RIPPER and sleeping-experts differ radically in many other respects: differences include different notions as to what constitutes a context, different ways of combining contexts to construct a classifier, different methods to search for a combination of contexts, and different criteria as to what contexts should be included in such a combination. In spite of these differences, both RIPPER and sleeping-experts perform extremely well across a wide variety of categorization problems, generally outperforming previously applied learning methods. We view this result as a confirmation of the usefulness of classifiers that represent contextual information."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23803","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23803","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23804","fieldValue":"El-Kwae, Essam A."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23804","fieldValue":" A framework for retrieving images by spatial similarity (FRISS) in ima ge databases is presented. In this framework, a robust retrieval by spatial similarity (RSS) algorithm is defined as one that incorporates both directional and topological spatial constraints, retrieves similar images, and recognized images even after they undergo translation, scaling, rotation (both perfect and multiple), or any arbitrary combination of transformatioins. The FRISS framework is discussed and used as a base for comparing various existing RSS algorithms. Analysis shows that none of them satisfies all the FRISS specifications. An algorithm, SIMdtc, is then presented. SIMdtc introduces the concept of a rotation correction angle(RCA) to align objects in one image spatially closer to matching objects in another image for more accurate similarity assessment. Similarity between two images is a function of the number of common objects between them and the closeness of directional and topological spatial relationships between object pairs in both images. The SIMdtc retrieval is invariant under translation, scaling, and perfect rotation, and the algorithm is able to rank multiple rotation variants. The algorithm was tested using synthetic images and the TESSA image database. Analysis shows the robustness of the SIMdtc algorithm over current algorithms."}
