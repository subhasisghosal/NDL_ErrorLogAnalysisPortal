It has been observed that several proposed solutions to this problem can outperform their worst-case guarantees on real data. This leads to the question of whether some stronger bounds can be guaranteed. We answer this in the positive by showing that a class of counter-based algorithms (including the popular and very space-efficient Frequent and SpacesSaving algorithms) provides much stronger approximation guarantees than previously known. Specifically, we show that errors in the approximation of individual elements do not depend on the frequencies of the most frequent elements, but only on the frequency of the remaining tail. This shows that counter-based methods are the most space-efficient (in fact, space-optimal) algorithms having this strong error bound. This tail guarantee allows these algorithms to solve the sparse recovery problem. Here, the goal is to recover a faithful representation of the vector of frequencies, f. We prove that using space O(k), the algorithms construct an approximation f&ast; to the frequency vector f so that the $L_1 error &par;&par;fâˆ\u2019&par;f&ast;&par;1 is close to the best possible error minfâ\u20AC² &par;fâ\u20AC² âˆ\u2019 f&par;1$, where fâ\u20AC² ranges over all vectors with at most k non-zero entries. This improves the previously best known space bound of about O(k log n) for streams without element deletions (where n is the size of the domain from which stream elements are drawn). Other consequences of the tail guarantees are results for skewed (Zipfian) data, and guarantees for accuracy of merging multiple summarized streams."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14522","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/14523","fieldValue":" This article investigates the question of whether a partially closed database has complete information to answer a query. In practice an enterprise often maintains master data $D_m, a closed-world database. We say that a database D is partially closed if it satisfies a set V of containment constraints of the form q(D) &subse; p(Dm), where q is a query in a language LC and p is a projection query. The part of D not constrained by (Dm, V) is open, from which some tuples may be missing. The database D is said to be complete for a query Q relative to (Dm, V) if for all partially closed extensions D' of D, Q(D') &equals; Q(D), i.e., adding tuples to D either violates some constraints in V or does not change the answer to Q. We first show that the proposed model can also capture the consistency of data, in addition to its relative completeness. Indeed, integrity constraints studied for data consistency can be expressed as containment constraints. We then study two problems. One is to decide, given Dm, V, a query Q in a language LQ, and a partially closed database D, whether D is complete for Q relative to (Dm, V). The other is to determine, given Dm, V and Q, whether there exists a partially closed database that is complete for Q relative to (Dm, V). We establish matching lower and upper bounds on these problems for a variety of languages LQ and LC. We also provide characterizations for a database to be relatively complete, and for a query to allow a relatively complete database, when LQ and LC$ are conjunctive queries."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/14523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/14523","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14524","fieldValue":"Fletcher, George H L"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/14524","fieldValue":"Van Den Bussche, Jan"}
