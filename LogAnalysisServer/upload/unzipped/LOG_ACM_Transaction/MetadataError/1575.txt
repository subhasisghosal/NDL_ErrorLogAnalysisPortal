{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/2494","fieldValue":" In this work we study weighted network congestion games with player-specific latency functions where selfish players wish to route their traffic through a shared network. We consider both the case of splittable and unsplittable traffic. Our main findings are as follows. For routing games on parallel links with linear latency functions, we introduce two new potential functions for unsplittable and for splittable traffic, respectively. We use these functions to derive results on the convergence to pure Nash equilibria and the computation of equilibria. For several generalizations of these routing games, we show that such potential functions do not exist. We prove tight upper and lower bounds on the price of anarchy for games with polynomial latency functions. All our results on the price of anarchy translate to general congestion games."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2494","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/2494","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15763","fieldValue":" We present a new approach to realtime character animation with interactive control. Given a corpus of motion capture data and a desired task, we automatically compute near-optimal controllers using a low-dimensional basis representation. We show that these controllers produce motion that fluidly responds to several dimensions of user control and environmental constraints in realtime. Our results indicate that very few basis functions are required to create high-fidelity character controllers which permit complex user navigation and obstacle-avoidance tasks."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15763","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15763","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15764","fieldValue":" In this paper, we present a technique for generating animation from a variety of user-defined constraints. We pose constraint-based motion synthesis as a maximum a posterior (MAP) problem and develop an optimization framework that generates natural motion satisfying user constraints. The system automatically learns a statistical dynamic model from motion capture data and then enforces it as a motion prior. This motion prior, together with user-defined constraints, comprises a trajectory optimization problem. Solving this problem in the low-dimensional space yields optimal natural motion that achieves the goals specified by the user. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by generating whole-body and facial motion from a variety of spatial-temporal constraints."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15765","fieldValue":" We present Soft Scissors, an interactive tool for extracting alpha mattes of foreground objects in realtime. We recently proposed a novel offline matting algorithm capable of extracting high-quality mattes for complex foreground objects such as furry animals [Wang and Cohen 2007]. In this paper we both improve the quality of our offline algorithm and give it the ability to incrementally update the matte in an online interactive setting. Our realtime system efficiently estimates foreground color thereby allowing both the matte and the final composite to be revealed instantly as the user roughly paints along the edge of the foreground object. In addition, our system can dynamically adjust the width and boundary conditions of the scissoring paint brush to approximately capture the boundary of the foreground object that lies ahead on the scissor's path. These advantages in both speed and accuracy create the first interactive tool for high quality image matting and compositing."}
