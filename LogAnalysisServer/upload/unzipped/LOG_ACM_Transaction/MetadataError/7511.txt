{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9831","fieldValue":" Reliability has been well recognized as an important design objective in the design of modern high-speed networks. While traditional approaches offer either 100% protection in the presence of single link failure or no protection at all, connections in real networks may have multiple reliability requirements. The concept of differentiated reliability (DiR) has been introduced in the literature to provide multiple reliability requirements in protection schemes that provision spare resources. In this paper, we consider the problem of routing connections with differentiated reliability in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks when backup sharing is not allowed. Our objective is to route connections with minimum network cost (e.g., network resources) while meeting their required reliability. We assume connections arrive dynamically one-at-a-time and a decision as to accept or reject a connection has to be made without a priori knowledge of future arrivals. Since sharing cannot be used for achieving efficiency, the goal is to achieve efficiency by improved path selection. In this paper, we first present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for the problem. By solving the ILP formulation, we can obtain an optimal solution with respect to the current network state for each dynamic arrival. To solve the ILP formulation, however, is time consuming for large networks. We thus propose two approximation algorithms for the problem. The first one, called Shortest-Path-Pair-based Auxiliary graph (SPPA), can obtain an Æ?-approximation solution whose cost is at most 1 + Æ? times the optimum in $O((n^2$(n + 1) + 2mn)(log log(2n) + 1\/Æ?))time, where n and m are the number of nodes and links in a network, respectively. To reduce the computational complexity of the first algorithm, the second algorithm, called Auxiliary graph-based Two-Step Approach (ATSA), is proposed and can obtain a near optimal solution with cost at most 2 + Æ? times that of the optimal solution in O(mn(log log n+1\/Æ?)) time. Results from extensive simulations conducted on two typical carrier mesh networks show the efficiency of the two algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9831","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9831","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9831","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9832","fieldValue":" The availability of cost-effective wireless network interface cards makes it practical to design network devices with multiple radios which can be exploited to simultane-ously transmit\/receive over different frequency channels. It has been shown that using multiple radios per node increases the throughput of multi-hop wireless mesh networks. However, multi-radios create several research challenges. A fundamental problem is the joint channel assignment and routing problem, i.e., how the channels can be assigned to radios and how a set of flow rates can be determined for every network link in order to achieve an anticipated objective. This joint problem is NP-com-plete. Thus, an approximate solution is developed by solving the channel assignment and the routing problems separately. The channel assignment problem turns out to be the problem to assign channels such that a given set of flow rates are schedulable and itself is shown to be also NP-complete. This paper shows that not only the channels but also the transmission rates of the links have to be properly selected to make a given set of flow rates schedulable. Thus, a greedy heuristic for the channel and rate assignment problem is developed. Algorithms to schedule the resulting set of flow rates have been proposed in the literature, which require synchronization among nodes and hence modified coordination functions. Unlike previous work, in this paper a forwarding paradigm is developed to achieve the resulting set of flow rates while using a standard MAC. A bi-dimensional Markov chain model of the proposed forwarding paradigm is presented to analyze its behavior. Thorough performance studies are con-ducted to: a) compare the proposed greedy heuristic to other channel assignment algorithms; b) analyze the behavior of the forwarding paradigm through numerical simulations based on the Markov chain model; c) simulate the operations of the forwarding paradigm and evaluate the achieved network throughput."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9832","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9832","fieldValue":"A channel and rate assignment algorithm and a layer-2.5 forwarding paradigm for multi-radio wireless mesh networks"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9832","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9833","fieldValue":" In this paper, we use fluid model techniques to es-tablish new results for the throughput of input-buffered switches. Dai and Prabhakar have shown that any maximal size matching algorithm with speedup of 2 achieves 100% throughput. We introduce the maximum node containing matching (MNCM), which is a new class of matching algorithms that achieve 100% throughput with no speedup. The only assumption on the arrival processes is they satisfy the strong law of large numbers (SLLN). The MNCM policies only need to include ports whose weight (backlog) are above a threshold in the matching rather than finding a matching with maximum total weight. This simplified requirement enables us to introduce a new matching algorithm, maximum first matching (MFM), with $O(N^2.5$) complexity. We show that MFM is a low-complexity algorithm with good delay performance. We also provide a deterministic upper bound for the buffering requirement of a switch with an MNCM scheduler, when the ports incoming traffic are admissible and (Ïƒ, Ï?) regulated."}
