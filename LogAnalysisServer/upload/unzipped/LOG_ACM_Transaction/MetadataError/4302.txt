{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23931","fieldValue":" We present a method for creating a comparable text corpus from two document collections in different languages. The collections can be very different in origin. In this study, we build a comparable corpus from articles by a Swedish news agency and a U.S. newspaper. The keys with best resolution power were extracted from the documents of one collection, the source collection, by using the relative average term frequency (RATF) value. The keys were translated into the language of the other collection, the target collection, with a dictionary-based query translation program. The translated queries were run against the target collection and an alignment pair was made if the retrieved documents matched given date and similarity score criteria. The resulting comparable collection was used as a similarity thesaurus to translate queries along with a dictionary-based translator. The combined approaches outperformed translation schemes where dictionary-based translation or corpus translation was used alone."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23931","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23931","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/23932","fieldValue":"Sheng, Olivia R Liu"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23932","fieldValue":" Web search engines typically provide search results without considering user interests or context. We propose a personalized search approach that can easily extend a conventional search engine on the client side. Our mapping framework automatically maps a set of known user interests onto a group of categories in the Open Directory Project (ODP) and takes advantage of manually edited data available in ODP for training text classifiers that correspond to, and therefore categorize and personalize search results according to user interests. In two sets of controlled experiments, we compare our personalized categorization system (PCAT) with a list interface system (LIST) that mimics a typical search engine and with a nonpersonalized categorization system (CAT). In both experiments, we analyze system performances on the basis of the type of task and query length. We find that PCAT is preferable to LIST for information gathering types of tasks and for searches with short queries, and PCAT outperforms CAT in both information gathering and finding types of tasks, and for searches associated with free-form queries. From the subjects' answers to a questionnaire, we find that PCAT is perceived as a system that can find relevant Web pages quicker and easier than LIST and CAT."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23932","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23932","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23933","fieldValue":" The so-called â\u20ACœredundancy-basedâ\u20AC? approach to question answering represents a successful strategy for mining answers to factoid questions such as â\u20ACœWho shot Abraham Lincoln&quest;â\u20AC? from the World Wide Web. Through contrastive and ablation experiments with Aranea, a system that has performed well in several TREC QA evaluations, this work examines the underlying assumptions and principles behind redundancy-based techniques. Specifically, we develop two theses: that stable characteristics of data redundancy allow factoid systems to rely on external â\u20ACœblack boxâ\u20AC? components, and that despite embodying a data-driven approach, redundancy-based methods encode a substantial amount of knowledge in the form of heuristics. Overall, this work attempts to address the broader question of â\u20ACœwhat really mattersâ\u20AC? and to provide guidance for future researchers."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23933","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23933","fieldValue":"ACM"}
