This is the case of mass spectrometry (MS) data, an important component of many types of proteomic analysis. A central problem occurs when one needs to integrate (MS) data produced by different sources, e.g., different equipment and\/or laboratories. In these cases, some form of \"data integrationâ\u20AC? or \"data fusionâ\u20AC? may be necessary in order to discard some source-specific aspects and improve the ability to perform a classification task such as inferring the \"disease classesâ\u20AC? of patients. The need for new high-performance data alignments methods is therefore particularly important in these contexts. In this paper, we propose an approach based both on an information theory perspective, generally used in a feature construction problem, and the application of a mathematical programming task (i.e., the weighted bipartite matching problem). We present the results of a competitive analysis of our method against other approaches. The analysis was conducted on data from plasma\/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid of \"controlâ\u20AC? and Alzheimer patients collected from three different hospitals. The results point to a significant performance advantage of our method with respect to the competing ones tested."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4774","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4774","fieldValue":"Optimization, information theory, medicine, medical informatics, proteomics, data integration, graph algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4774","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4774","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/4775","fieldValue":"Fagundes-Lima, Denise"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4775","fieldValue":" We comment on the flexibility profiles calculated by Zeng et al., and show that these profiles do not represent the local flexibility of the DNA molecule. If one takes into account the physics of elasticity, the averaged flexibility profile show an additional peak which is missed in the original calculation. We show that it is not possible to calculate the flexibility of a 6-mer using tetranucleotide elastic constants, the shortest sequence is a 7-mer. For 6-mers, dinucleotide or trinucleotide parameters are needed. We present calculations for dinucleotide flexibility parameters and show that the same additional peak is present for both 7--mers and 6-mers."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4775","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}
