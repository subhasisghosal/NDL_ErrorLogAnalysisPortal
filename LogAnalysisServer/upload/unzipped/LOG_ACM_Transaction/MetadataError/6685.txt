Recently, complex and unstructured (or semi-structured) datasets have appeared as targets for major data mining applications, including text mining, web mining and bioinformatics. Our work focuses on labeled ordered trees, which are typically semi-structured datasets. In bioinformatics, carbohydrate sugar chains, or glycans, can be modeled as labeled ordered trees. Glycans are the third major class of biomolecules, having important roles in signaling and recognition. For mining labeled ordered trees, we propose a new probabilistic model and its efficient learning scheme which significantly improves the time and space complexity of an existing probabilistic model for labeled ordered trees. We evaluated the performance of the proposed model, comparing it with those of other probabilistic models, using synthetic as well as real datasets from glycobiology. Experimental results showed that the proposed model drastically reduced the computation time of the competing model, keeping the predictive power and avoiding overfitting to the training data. Finally, we assessed our results on real data from a variety of biological viewpoints, verifying known facts in glycobiology."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7844","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7844","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/1708","fieldValue":" With the number of cores of chip multiprocessors (CMPs) rapidly growing as technology scales down, connecting the different components of a CMP in a scalable and efficient way becomes increasingly challenging. In this article, we explore the architectural-level implications of interconnection network design for CMPs with up to 128 fine-grain multithreaded cores. We evaluate and compare different network topologies using accurate simulation of the full chip, including the memory hierarchy and interconnect, and using a diverse set of scientific and engineering workloads. We find that the interconnect has a large impact on performance, as it is responsible for 60&percnt; to 75&percnt; of the miss latency. Latency, and not bandwidth, is the primary performance constraint, since, even with many threads per core and workloads with high miss rates, networks with enough bandwidth can be efficiently implemented for the system scales we consider. From the topologies we study, the flattened butterfly consistently outperforms the mesh and fat tree on all workloads, leading to performance advantages of up to 22&percnt;. We also show that considering interconnect and memory hierarchy together when designing large-scale CMPs is crucial, and neglecting either of the two can lead to incorrect conclusions. Finally, the effect of the interconnect on overall performance becomes more important as the number of cores increases, making interconnection choices especially critical when scaling up."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1708","fieldValue":"ACM"}
