Specifically, we consider a processor that can vary its speed between 0 and a maximum speed T to minimize its energy usage (the rate is believed to be a cubic function of the speed). As the speed is upper bounded, the processor may be overloaded with jobs and no scheduling algorithms can guarantee to meet the deadlines of all jobs. An optimal schedule is expected to maximize the throughput, and furthermore, its energy usage should be the smallest among all schedules that achieve the maximum throughput. In designing a scheduling algorithm, one has to face the dilemma of selecting more jobs and being conservative in energy usage. If we ignore energy usage, the best possible online algorithm is 4-competitive on throughput [Koren and Shasha 1995]. On the other hand, existing work on energy-efficient scheduling focuses on a setting where the processor speed is unbounded and the concern is on minimizing the energy to complete all jobs; O(1)-competitive online algorithms with respect to energy usage have been known [Yao et al. 1995; Bansal et al. 2007a; Li et al. 2006]. This article presents the first online algorithm for the more realistic setting where processor speed is bounded and the system may be overloaded; the algorithm is O(1)-competitive on both throughput and energy usage. If the maximum speed of the online scheduler is relaxed slightly to (1+&epsis;)T for some &epsis; > 0, we can improve the competitive ratio on throughput to arbitrarily close to one, while maintaining O(1)-competitiveness on energy usage."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/2401","fieldValue":"ACM"}
