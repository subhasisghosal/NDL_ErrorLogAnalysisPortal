While qualitative attributes of the offered service classes are often well defined, the actual differentiation between classes is left as an open issue. We address here the proportional QoS model, which aims at maintaining pre-defined ratios between the service class delays (or related congestion measures). In particular, we consider capacity assignment among service classes as the means for attaining this design objective. Starting with a detailed analysis for the single hop model, we first obtain the required capacity assignment for fixed flow rates. We then analyze the scheme under a reactive scenario, in which self-optimizing users may choose their service class in response to capacity modifications. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium in which the required ratios are maintained, and address the efficient computation of the optimal capacities. We further provide dynamic schemes for capacity adjustment, and consider the incorporation of pricing and congestion control to enforce absolute performance bounds on top of the proportional ones. Finally, we extend our basic results to networks with general topology."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9796","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9796","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9796","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9797","fieldValue":" We study the problem of load balancing the traffic from a set of unicast and multicast sessions. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem. However, we assume that the gradient of the network cost function is not available and needs to be estimated. Multiple paths are provided between a source and a destination using application-layer overlay. We propose a novel algorithm that is based on what is known as simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation and utilizes only noisy measurements collected and reported to the sources, using an overlay architecture. We consider three network models that reflect different sets of assumptions regarding multicast capabilities of the network. Using an analytical model we first prove the almost sure convergence of the algorithm to a corresponding optimal solution under each network model considered in this paper with decreasing step sizes. Then, we establish the weak convergence (or convergence in distribution) with a fixed step size. In addition, we investigate the benefits acquired from implementing additional multicast capabilities by studying the relative performance of our algorithm under the three network models."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9797","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9797","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9797","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9798","fieldValue":" This paper investigates the problem of assessing the quality of video transmitted over IP networks. Our goal is to develop a methodology that is both reasonably accurate and simple enough to support the large-scale deployments that the increasing use of video over IP are likely to demand. For that purpose, we focus on developing an approach that is capable of mapping network statistics, e.g., packet losses, available from simple measurements, to the quality of video sequences reconstructed by receivers. A first step in that direction is a loss-distortion model that accounts for the impact of network losses on video quality, as a function of application-specific parameters such as video codec, loss recovery technique, coded bit rate, packetization, video characteristics, etc. The model, although accurate, is poorly suited to large-scale, on-line monitoring, because of its dependency on parameters that are difficult to estimate in real-time. As a result, we introduce a \"relative quality\" metric (rPSNR) that bypasses this problem by measuring video quality against a quality benchmark that the network is expected to provide. The approach offers a lightweight video quality monitoring solution that is suitable for large-scale deployments. We assess its feasibility and accuracy through extensive simulations and experiments."}
