This predictor can achieve superior accuracy to a path-based and a global perceptron predictor, previously the most accurate dynamic branch predictors known in the literature. We also show how such a predictor can be ahead pipelined to yield one cycle effective latency. On the SPECint2000 set of benchmarks, the hashed perceptron predictor improves accuracy by up to 15.6&percnt; over a MAC-RHSP and 27.2&percnt; over a path-based neural predictor."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1620","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1620","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6764","fieldValue":" This article presents a framework for deploying a minimal number of smart meters to accurately track the ON\/OFF states of a massive number of electrical appliances which exploits the sparseness feature of simultaneous ON\/OFF switching events of the massive appliances. A theoretical bound on the least number of required smart meters is studied by an entropy-based approach, which qualifies the impact of meter deployment strategies to the state tracking accuracy. It motivates a meter deployment optimization algorithm (MDOP) to minimize the number of meters while satisfying given requirements to state tracking accuracy. To accurately decode the real-time ON\/OFF states of appliances by the readings of meters, a fast state decoding (FSD) algorithm based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) is presented to track the state sequence of each appliance for better accuracy. Although traditional HMM needs $O(t2^2N) time complexity to conduct online sequence decoding, FSD improves the complexity to O(tnU&plus;1$), where n < N and U is an upper bound of the simultaneous switching events. Both MDOP and FSD are verified extensively using simulations and real PowerNet data. The results show that the meter deployment cost can be saved by more than 80&percnt; while still getting over 90&percnt; state tracking accuracy."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6764","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6765","fieldValue":" With the proposed penetration of electric vehicles and advanced metering technology, the demand side is foreseen to play a major role in flexible energy consumption scheduling. On the other hand, the past several years have witnessed utility companies' growing interests to integrate more renewable energy resources. These renewable resources, for example, wind or solar, due to their intermittent nature, brought great uncertainty to the power grid system. In this article, we propose a mechanism that attempts to mitigate the grid operational uncertainty induced by renewable energies by properly exploiting demand flexibility with the help of advanced smart-metering technology. To address the challenge, we develop a novel locational marginal price (LMP)-based pricing scheme that involves active demand-side participation by casting the network objective as a two-stage Stackelberg game between the local grid operator and several aggregators. In contrast to the conventional notion that generation follows load, our game formulation provides more flexibility for the operators and tries to provide adequate incentives for the loads to follow the (stochastic renewable) generation. We use the solution concept of subgame perfect equilibrium to analyze the resulting game. Subsequently, we discuss the optimal real-time conventional capacity planning for the local grid operator to achieve the minimal mismatch between supply and demand with the wind power integration. Finally, we assess our proposed scheme with field data. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme works reasonably well in the long term, even with simple heuristics."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6765","fieldValue":"ACM"}
