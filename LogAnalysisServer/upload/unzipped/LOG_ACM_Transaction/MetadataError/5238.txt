The significance of finding the minimum gene subsets is three-fold: 1) It greatly reduces the computational burden and \"noiseâ\u20AC? arising from irrelevant genes. In the examples studied in this paper, finding the minimum gene subsets even allows for extraction of simple diagnostic rules which lead to accurate diagnosis without the need for any classifiers. 2) It simplifies gene expression tests to include only a very small number of genes rather than thousands of genes, which can bring down the cost for cancer testing significantly. 3) It calls for further investigation into the possible biological relationship between these small numbers of genes and cancer development and treatment. Our simple yet very effective method involves two steps. In the first step, we choose some important genes using a feature importance ranking scheme. In the second step, we test the classification capability of all simple combinations of those important genes by using a good classifier. For three \"smallâ\u20AC? and \"simpleâ\u20AC? data sets with two, three, and four cancer (sub)types, our approach obtained very high accuracy with only two or three genes. For a \"largeâ\u20AC? and \"complexâ\u20AC? data set with 14 cancer types, we divided the whole problem into a group of binary classification problems and applied the 2--step approach to each of these binary classification problems. Through this \"divide-and-conquerâ\u20AC? approach, we obtained accuracy comparable to previously reported results but with only 28 genes rather than 16,063 genes. In general, our method can significantly reduce the number of genes required for highly reliable diagnosis."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4270","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4270","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4270","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4271","fieldValue":" Accurate base-assignment in repeat regions of a whole genome shotgun assembly is an unsolved problem. Since reads in repeat regions cannot be easily attributed to a unique location in the genome, current assemblers may place these reads arbitrarily. As a result, the base-assignment error rate in repeats is likely to be much higher than that in the rest of the genome. We developed an iterative algorithm, EULER-AIR, that is able to correct base-assignment errors in finished genome sequences in public databases. The Wolbachia genome is among the best finished genomes. Using this genome project as an example, we demonstrated that EULER-AIR can 1) discover and correct base-assignment errors, 2) provide accurate read assignments, 3) utilize finishing reads for accurate base-assignment, and 4) provide guidance for designing finishing experiments. In the genome of Wolbachia, EULER-AIR found 16 positions with ambiguous base-assignment and two positions with erroneous bases. Besides Wolbachia, many other genome sequencing projects have significantly fewer finishing reads and, hence, are likely to contain more base-assignment errors in repeats. We demonstrate that EULER-AIR is a software tool that can be used to find and correct base-assignment errors in a genome assembly project."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4271","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4271","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4272","fieldValue":" It is crucial for cancer diagnosis and treatment to accurately identify the site of origin of a tumor. With the emergence and rapid advancement of DNA microarray technologies, constructing gene expression profiles for different cancer types has already become a promising means for cancer classification. In addition to research on binary classification such as normal versus tumor samples, which attracts numerous efforts from a variety of disciplines, the discrimination of multiple tumor types is also important. Meanwhile, the selection of genes which are relevant to a certain cancer type not only improves the performance of the classifiers, but also provides molecular insights for treatment and drug development. Here, we use Semisupervised Ellipsoid ARTMAP (ssEAM) for multiclass cancer discrimination and particle swarm optimization for informative gene selection. ssEAM is a neural network architecture rooted in Adaptive Resonance Theory and suitable for classification tasks. ssEAM features fast, stable, and finite learning and creates hyperellipsoidal clusters, inducing complex nonlinear decision boundaries. PSO is an evolutionary algorithm-based technique for global optimization. A discrete binary version of PSO is employed to indicate whether genes are chosen or not. The effectiveness of ssEAM\/PSO for multiclass cancer diagnosis is demonstrated by testing it on three publicly available multiple-class cancer data sets. ssEAM\/PSO achieves competitive performance on all these data sets, with results comparable to or better than those obtained by other classifiers."}
