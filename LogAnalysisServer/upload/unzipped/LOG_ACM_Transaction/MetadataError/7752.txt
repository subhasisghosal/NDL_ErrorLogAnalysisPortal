In this paper, the problem of allocating resources (channels and transmission power) in multihop CR networks is modeled as a multicommodity flow problem with the dynamic link capacity resulting from dynamic resource allocation, which is in sharp contrast with existing flow-control approaches that assume fixed link capacity. Based on queue-balancing network flow control that is ideally suited for handling dynamically changing spectrum availability in CR networks, we propose a distributed scheme (installed and operational in each node) for optimal resource allocation without exchanging spectrum dynamics information between remote nodes. Considering the power masks, each node makes resource-allocation decisions based on current or past local information from neighboring nodes to satisfy the throughput requirement of each flow. Parameters of these proposed schemes are configured to maintain the network stability. The performance of the proposed scheme for both asynchronous and synchronous scenarios is analyzed comparatively. Both cases of sufficient and insufficient network capacity are considered."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10316","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10316","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10316","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10317","fieldValue":" In this paper, we study the problem of reliable collective communication (broadcast or gossip) with the objective of maximizing the reliability of the collective communication. The need for collective communication arises in many problems of parallel and distributed computing, including Grid or cloud computing and database management. We describe the network model, formulate the reliable collective communication problem, prove that the maximum reliable collective communication problem is NP-hard, and provide an integer linear program (ILP) formulation for the problem. We then provide a greedy approximation algorithm to construct collective communication (through a spanning tree) that achieves an approximation ratio of 1 + ln(|V| + Î±|E| - 1), where is the average number of shared link risk groups (SRLGs) along links, and |V| and |E| are the total number of vertices and edges of the network, respectively. Simulations demonstrate that our approximation algorithm achieves good performance in both small and large networks and that, in almost 95% of total cases, our algorithm outperforms the modified minimum spanning tree algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10317","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10317","fieldValue":"ACM"}
