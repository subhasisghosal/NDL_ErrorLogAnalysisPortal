The challenges include heterogeneity, fairness, real-time constraints, and quality of service. We study the problem of rate allocation and receiver partitioning in layered and replicated media systems. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing a close approximation of the so-called max-min fairness metric subject to loss and bandwidth constraints. Our optimal Layered Media Multicast Control (LMMC) solution to the problem analytically determines the layer rates and the corresponding partitioning of the receivers. Our simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed solution in realistic scenarios."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9350","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9350","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9351","fieldValue":"Akan, zgr B."}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9351","fieldValue":" Currently there is no control for real-time traffic sources in IP networks. This is a serious problem because real-time traffic can not only congest the network but can also cause unfairness and starvation of TCP traffic. However, it is not possible to apply current solutions for Internet to the networks with high bandwidth-delay products and high bit error rates. The channel errors may result in inaccurate congestion control decisions and unnecessary rate throttles leading to severe performance degradation. This problem is amplified in the links with high bandwidth-delay products, since the link is inefficiently utilized for a very long time until the unnecessary rate throttle is recovered. In this paper, a new Rate Control Scheme, RCS, is introduced for real-time interactive applications in networks with high bandwidth-delay products and high bit error rates. RCS is based on the concept of using dummy packets to probe the availability of network resources. Dummy packets are treated as low priority packets and consequently they do not affect the throughput of actual data traffic. Therefore, RCS requires all the routers in the connection path to support some priority policy. A new algorithm is also proposed to improve the robustness of the RCS to temporal signal loss conditions. The delay-bound considerations for real-time traffic sources using RCS rate control scheme are also investigated. Simulation experiments show that in environments with high bandwidth-delay products and high bit error rates, RCS achieves high throughput performance without penalizing TCP connections."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9351","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9351","fieldValue":"A rate control scheme for adaptive real-time applications in IP networks with lossy links and long round trip times"}
