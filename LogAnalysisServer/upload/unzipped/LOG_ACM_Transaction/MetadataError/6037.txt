{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6029","fieldValue":" Display advertisements are typically sold by the impression, where one impression is simply one download of an ad. Previous work has shown that the longer an ad is in view, the more likely a user is to remember it and that there are diminishing returns to increased exposure time [Goldstein et al. 2011]. Since a pricing scheme that is at least partially based on time is more exact than one based solely on impressions, time-based advertising may become an industry standard. We answer an open question concerning time-based pricing schemes: how should time slots for advertisements be divided? We provide evidence that ads can be scheduled in a way that leads to greater total recollection, which advertisers value, and increased revenue, which publishers value. We document two main findings. First, we show that displaying two shorter ads results in more total recollection than displaying one longer ad of twice the duration. Second, we show that this effect disappears as the duration of these ads increases. We conclude with a theoretical prediction regarding the circumstances under which the display advertising industry would benefit if it moved to a partially or fully time-based standard."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6029","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6030","fieldValue":" We consider the problem of playing a repeated two-player zero-sum game safety: that is, guaranteeing at least the value of the game per period in expectation regardless of the strategy used by the opponent. Playing a stage-game equilibrium strategy at each time step clearly guarantees safety, and prior work has (incorrectly) stated that it is impossible to simultaneously deviate from a stage-game equilibrium (in hope of exploiting a suboptimal opponent) and to guarantee safety. We show that such profitable deviations are indeed possible specifically in games where certain types of â\u20ACœgiftâ\u20AC? strategies exist, which we define formally. We show that the set of strategies constituting such gifts can be strictly larger than the set of iteratively weakly-dominated strategies; this disproves another recent assertion which states that all noniteratively weakly dominated strategies are best responses to each equilibrium strategy of the other player. We present a full characterization of safe strategies, and develop efficient algorithms for exploiting suboptimal opponents while guaranteeing safety. We also provide analogous results for extensive-form games of perfect and imperfect information, and present safe exploitation algorithms and full characterizations of safe strategies for those settings as well. We present experimental results in Kuhn poker, a canonical test problem for game-theoretic algorithms. Our experiments show that (1) aggressive safe exploitation strategies significantly outperform adjusting the exploitation within stage-game equilibrium strategies only and (2) all the safe exploitation strategies significantly outperform a (nonsafe) best response strategy against strong dynamic opponents."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/6030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/6030","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/6031","fieldValue":" We study truthful auctions for secondary spectrum usage in wireless networks.

We present the first truthful mechanisms for secondary spectrum auctions with symmetric or submodular valuations.
