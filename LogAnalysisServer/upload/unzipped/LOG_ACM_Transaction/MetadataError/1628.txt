Methods based on precomputation provide accurate, real-time solutions, but are hard to extend to dynamic scenes. Specialized approaches for soft shadows can deal with dynamic objects but are not fast enough to handle more than one light source. In this paper, we present a technique for rendering dynamic objects under arbitrary environment illumination, which does not require any precomputation. The key ingredient is a fast, approximate technique for computing soft shadows, which achieves several hundred frames per second for a single light source. This allows for approximating environment illumination with a sparse collection of area light sources and yields real-time frame rates."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15906","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15906","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15907","fieldValue":" We present a new technique for interactive relighting of dynamic refractive objects with complex material properties. We describe our technique in terms of a rendering pipeline in which each stage runs entirely on the GPU. The rendering pipeline converts surfaces to volumetric data, traces the curved paths of photons as they refract through the volume, and renders arbitrary views of the resulting radiance distribution. Our rendering pipeline is fast enough to permit interactive updates to lighting, materials, geometry, and viewing parameters without any precomputation. Applications of our technique include the visualization of caustics, absorption, and scattering while running physical simulations or while manipulating surfaces in real time."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15907","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15907","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/15908","fieldValue":"Shum, Heung-Yeung"}
