{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10012","fieldValue":" Mobile TV broadcast networks have received significant attention from the industry and academia, as they have already been deployed in several countries around the world and their expected market potential is huge. In such networks, a base station broadcasts TV channels in bursts with bit rates much higher than the encoding bit rates of the videos. This enables mobile receivers to receive a burst of traffic and then turn off their receiving circuits till the next burst to conserve energy. The base station needs to construct a transmission schedule for all bursts of different TV channels. Constructing optimal (in terms of energy saving) transmission schedules has been shown to be an NP-complete problem when the TV channels carry video streams encoded at arbitrary and variable bit rates. In this paper, we propose a near-optimal approximation algorithm to solve this problem. We prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm and derive its approximation factor. We also conduct extensive evaluation of our algorithm using implementation in a real mobile TV testbed as well as simulations. Our experimental and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm: 1) is practical and produces correct burst schedules; 2) achieves near-optimal energy saving for mobile devices; and 3) runs efficiently in real time and scales to large scheduling problems."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10012","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10012","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10012","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10013","fieldValue":" We analyze the performance limits of data dissemination with multichannel, single radio sensors under random packet loss. We formulate the problem of minimizing the average delay of data dissemination as a stochastic shortest path problem and show that, for an arbitrary topology network, an optimal control policy can be found in a finite number of steps, using value iteration or Dijkstra's algorithm. However, the computational complexity of this solution is generally prohibitive. We thus focus on two special classes of network topologies of practical interest, namely single-hop clusters and multihop cluster chains. For these topologies, we derive the structure of policies that achieve an asymptotically optimal average delay, in networks with large number of nodes. Our analysis reveals that a single radio in each node suffices to achieve performance gain directly proportional to the total number of channels available. Through simulation, we show that the derived policies perform close to optimal even for networks with small and moderate numbers of nodes and can be implemented with limited overhead."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10013","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.title","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10013","fieldValue":"Asymptotically optimal data dissemination in multichannel wireless sensor networks: single radios suffice"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10013","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10013","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10014","fieldValue":" This paper presents Interleaved Stratified Timer Wheels as a novel priority queue data structure for traffic shaping and scheduling in packet-switched networks. The data structure is used to construct an efficient packet approximation of general processor sharing (GPS). This scheduler is the first of its kind by combining all desirable properties without any residual catch. In contrast to previous work, the scheduler presented here has constant and near-optimal delay and fairness properties, and can be implemented with O(1) algorithmic complexity, and has a low absolute execution overhead. The paper presents the priority queue data structure and the basic scheduling algorithm, along with several versions with different cost-performance trade-offs. A generalized analytical model for rate-controlled rounded time-stamp schedulers is developed and used to assess the scheduling properties of the different scheduler versions."}
