Our method consists of the following stages: a randomized decision forest classifier for image segmentation, a robust method for labeled dataset generation, a convolutional network for dense feature extraction, and finally an inverse kinematics stage for stable real-time pose recovery. As one possible application of this pipeline, we show state-of-the-art results for real-time puppeteering of a skinned hand-model."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17246","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17247","fieldValue":"Yoon, Sung-Eui"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17247","fieldValue":" Monte Carlo ray tracing is considered one of the most effective techniques for rendering photo-realistic imagery, but requires a large number of ray samples to produce converged or even visually pleasing images. We develop a novel image-plane adaptive sampling and reconstruction method based on local regression theory. A novel local space estimation process is proposed for employing the local regression, by robustly addressing noisy high-dimensional features. Given the local regression on estimated local space, we provide a novel two-step optimization process for selecting bandwidths of features locally in a data-driven way. Local weighted regression is then applied using the computed bandwidths to produce a smooth image reconstruction with well-preserved details. We derive an error analysis to guide our adaptive sampling process at the local space. We demonstrate that our method produces more accurate and visually pleasing results over the state-of-the-art techniques across a wide range of rendering effects. Our method also allows users to employ an arbitrary set of features, including noisy features, and robustly computes a subset of them by ignoring noisy features and decorrelating them for higher quality."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/17247","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/17247","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/17248","fieldValue":"Hu, Shi-Min"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/17248","fieldValue":" This article presents a versatile and robust SPH simulation approach for multiple-fluid flows. The spatial distribution of different phases or components is modeled using the volume fraction representation, the dynamics of multiple-fluid flows is captured by using an improved mixture model, and a stable and accurate SPH formulation is rigorously derived to resolve the complex transport and transformation processes encountered in multiple-fluid flows. The new approach can capture a wide range of real-world multiple-fluid phenomena, including mixing\/unmixing of miscible and immiscible fluids, diffusion effect and chemical reaction, etc. Moreover, the new multiple-fluid SPH scheme can be readily integrated into existing state-of-the-art SPH simulators, and the multiple-fluid simulation is easy to set up. Various examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}
