It is important to manage video data effectively to facilitate efficient retrieval. In this paper, we propose an efficient placement algorithm as part of an effective retrieval scheme to increase the number of clients who can be provided with interactive service. The proposed management schemes are incorporated with a bit count control method that is based on repeated tuning of quantization parameters to adjust the actual bit count to the target bit count. The encoder using this method can generate coded frames whose sizes are synchronized with the RAID stripe size, so that when various fast-forward levels are accessed we can reduce the seek and rotational latency and enhance the disk throughput of each disk in the RAID system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can significantly improve the average service time and guarantee more users service of quality, and the interactive media server can thereby efficiently service a large number of clients."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25316","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25316","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/25317","fieldValue":" Eye movements can be used to infer the allocation of covert attention. In this article, we propose to model the allocation of attention in a task-dependent manner based on different eye movement conditions, specifically fixation and pursuit. We show that the image complexity at eye fixation points during fixation, and the pursuit direction during pursuit are significant factors in attention allocation. Results of the study are applied to the design of an interactive computer game. Real-time eye movement information is taken as one of inputs for the game. The utility of such eye information for controlling game difficulty is shown."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/25317","fieldValue":"HCI"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/25317","fieldValue":"ACM"}
