This enables gradient-domain operations on out-of-core meshes with irregular connectivity. Taking a streaming mesh and boundary constraints as input, our solver builds a multigrid hierarchy and refines the multigrid solution progressively by performing all operations as streaming computations. A set of rules are carefully designed to make neighboring multigrid nodes perform tasks cooperatively and efficiently. With a sublinear memory growth with respect to the number of mesh vertices, our approach handles meshes with 14M vertices using merely 84MB of memory, while an equivalent in-core multigrid implementation fails to fit into 2GB memory space."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16211","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16211","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16212","fieldValue":" We describe a system for high-resolution capture of moving 3D geometry, beginning with dynamic normal maps from multiple views. The normal maps are captured using active shape-from-shading (photometric stereo), with a large lighting dome providing a series of novel spherical lighting configurations. To compensate for low-frequency deformation, we perform multi-view matching and thin-plate spline deformation on the initial surfaces obtained by integrating the normal maps. Next, the corrected meshes are merged into a single mesh using a volumetric method. The final output is a set of meshes, which were impossible to produce with previous methods. The meshes exhibit details on the order of a few millimeters, and represent the performance over human-size working volumes at a temporal resolution of 60Hz."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16212","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16212","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/16213","fieldValue":" We present a framework and algorithms for robust geometry and motion reconstruction of complex deforming shapes. Our method makes use of a smooth template that provides a crude approximation of the scanned object and serves as a geometric and topological prior for reconstruction. Large-scale motion of the acquired object is recovered using a novel space-time adaptive, non-rigid registration method. Fine-scale details such as wrinkles and folds are synthesized with an efficient linear mesh deformation algorithm. Subsequent spatial and temporal filtering of detail coefficients allows transfer of persistent geometric detail to regions not observed by the scanner. We show how this two-scale process allows faithful recovery of small-scale shape and motion features leading to a high-quality reconstruction. We illustrate the robustness and generality of our algorithm on a variety of examples composed of different materials and exhibiting a large range of dynamic deformations."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/16213","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/16213","fieldValue":"ACM"}
