We model a molecule as being made of helices and junctions. Those junctions are classified into topological families that determine their preferred 3D shapes. All the parts of the molecule are then allowed to establish long-distance contacts that induce a 3D folding of the molecule. An algorithm relying on game theory is proposed to discover such long-distance contacts that allow the molecule to reach a Nash equilibrium. As reported by our experiments, this approach allows one to predict the global shape of large molecules of several hundreds of nucleotides that are out of reach of the state-of-the-art methods."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4887","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_LARGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4887","fieldValue":"Junctions,Shape,Skeleton,Optimization,Games,RNA,Game theory,game theory,RNA,tertiary structure prediction,coarse-grain structure prediction"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/4887","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/4887","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/4888","fieldValue":" Computational analysis of data produced in deep sequencing (DS) experiments is challenging due to large data volumes and requirements for flexible analysis approaches. Here, we present a mathematical formalism based on set algebra for frequently performed operations in DS data analysis to facilitate translation of biomedical research questions to language amenable for computational analysis. With the help of this formalism, we implemented the Genomic Region Operation Kit (GROK), which supports various DS-related operations such as preprocessing, filtering, file conversion, and sample comparison. GROK provides high-level interfaces for R, Python, Lua, and command line, as well as an extension C++ API. It supports major genomic file formats and allows storing custom genomic regions in efficient data structures such as red-black trees and SQL databases. To demonstrate the utility of GROK, we have characterized the roles of two major transcription factors (TFs) in prostate cancer using data from 10 DS experiments.
