This maximizes throughput, but only with enough threads to keep hardware utilized. For applications or phases with more limited parallelism, we describe creating an out-of-order processor on-the-fly, by federating two neighboring in-order cores. We reuse the large register file in the multithreaded cores to implement some out-of-order structures and reengineer other large, associative structures into simpler lookup tables. The resulting federated core provides twice the single-thread performance of the underlying in-order core, allowing the architecture to efficiently support a wider range of parallelism."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1723","fieldValue":"CMP"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/1723","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/1723","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/7997","fieldValue":" Current popular anomaly detection algorithms are capable of detecting global anomalies but often fail to distinguish local anomalies from normal instances. Inspired by contemporary physics theory (i.e., heat diffusion and quantum mechanics), we propose two unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. Building on the embedding manifold derived from heat diffusion, we devise Local Anomaly Descriptor (LAD), which faithfully reveals the intrinsic neighborhood density. It uses a scale-dependent umbrella operator to bridge global and local properties, which makes LAD more informative within an adaptive scope of neighborhood. To offer more stability of local density measurement on scaling parameter tuning, we formulate Fermi Density Descriptor (FDD), which measures the probability of a fermion particle being at a specific location. By choosing the stable energy distribution function, FDD steadily distinguishes anomalies from normal instances with any scaling parameter setting. To further enhance the efficacy of our proposed algorithms, we explore the utility of anisotropic Gaussian kernel (AGK), which offers better manifold-aware affinity information. We also quantify and examine the effect of different Laplacian normalizations for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets verify that our proposed algorithms outperform the existing anomaly detection algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7997","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7997","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/7998","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/7998","fieldValue":"ACM"}
