Crawling techniques developed for traditional Web applications are not sufficient for crawling RIAs. The inability to crawl RIAs is a problem that needs to be addressed for at least making RIAs searchable and testable. We present a new methodology, called â\u20ACœmodel-based crawlingâ\u20AC?, that can be used as a basis to design efficient crawling strategies for RIAs. We illustrate model-based crawling with a sample strategy, called the â\u20ACœhypercube strategyâ\u20AC?. The performances of our model-based crawling strategies are compared against existing standard crawling strategies, including breadth-first, depth-first, and a greedy strategy. Experimental results show that our model-based crawling approach is significantly more efficient than these standard strategies."}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23300","fieldValue":"AJAX"}{"fieldName":"dc.subject","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23300","fieldValue":"DOM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23300","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23300","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23301","fieldValue":" The emergence of numerous online sources about local services presents a need for more automatic yet accurate data integration techniques. Local services are georeferenced objects and can be queried by their locations on a map, for instance, neighborhoods. Typical local service queries (e.g., â\u20ACœFrench Restaurant in The Loopâ\u20AC?) include not only information about â\u20ACœwhatâ\u20AC? (â\u20ACœFrench Restaurantâ\u20AC?) a user is searching for (such as cuisine) but also â\u20ACœwhereâ\u20AC? information, such as neighborhood (â\u20ACœThe Loopâ\u20AC?). In this article, we address three key problems: query translation, result merging and ranking. Most local search engines provide a (hierarchical) organization of (large) cities into neighborhoods. A neighborhood in one local search engine may correspond to sets of neighborhoods in other local search engines. These make the query translation challenging. To provide an integrated access to the query results returned by the local search engines, we need to combine the results into a single list of results. Our contributions include: (1) An integration algorithm for neighborhoods. (2) A very effective business listing resolution algorithm. (3) A ranking algorithm that takes into consideration the user criteria, user ratings and rankings. We have created a prototype system, Yumi, over local search engines in the restaurant domain. The restaurant domain is a representative case study for the local services. We conducted a comprehensive experimental study to evaluate Yumi. A prototype version of Yumi is available online."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/23301","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/23302","fieldValue":" Nowadays, the accumulation of people's whereabouts due to location-based applications has made it possible to construct their mobility profiles. This access to users' mobility profiles subsequently brings benefits back to location-based applications. For instance, in on-line social networks, friends can be recommended not only based on the similarity between their registered information, for instance, hobbies and professions but also referring to the similarity between their mobility profiles. In this article, we propose a new approach to construct and compare users' mobility profiles. First, we improve and apply frequent sequential pattern mining technologies to extract the sequences of places that a user frequently visits and use them to model his mobility profile. Second, we present a new method to calculate the similarity between two users using their mobility profiles. More specifically, we identify the weaknesses of a similarity metric in the literature, and propose a new one which not only fixes the weaknesses but also provides more precise and effective similarity estimation. Third, we consider the semantics of spatio-temporal information contained in user mobility profiles and add them into the calculation of user similarity. It enables us to measure users' similarity from different perspectives. Two specific types of semantics are explored in this article: location semantics and temporal semantics. Last, we validate our approach by applying it to two real-life datasets collected by Microsoft Research Asia and Yonsei University, respectively. The results show that our approach outperforms the existing works from several aspects."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/23302","fieldValue":"ACM"}
