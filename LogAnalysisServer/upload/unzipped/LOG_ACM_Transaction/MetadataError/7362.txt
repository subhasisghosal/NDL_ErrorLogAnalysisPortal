{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9534","fieldValue":" CSMA\/CA, the contention mechanism of the IEEE 802.11 DCF medium access protocol, has recently been found vulnerable to selfish backoff attacks consisting in nonstandard configuration of the constituent backoff scheme. Such attacks can greatly increase a selfish station's bandwidth share at the expense of honest stations applying a standard configuration. The paper investigates the distribution of bandwidth among anonymous network stations, some of which are selfish. A station's obtained bandwidth share is regarded as a payoff in a noncooperative CSMA\/CA game. Regardless of the IEEE 802.11 parameter setting, the payoff function is found similar to a multiplayer Prisoners' Dilemma; moreover, the number (though not the identities) of selfish stations can be inferred by observation of successful transmission attempts. Further, a repeated CSMA\/CA game is defined, where a station can toggle between standard and nonstandard backoff configurations with a view of maximizing a long-term utility. It is argued that a desirable station strategy should yield a fair, Pareto efficient, and subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. One such strategy, called CRISP, is described and evaluated."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9534","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9534","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9535","fieldValue":"Chou, Chun-Ting"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/9535","fieldValue":"N, Sai Shankar"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9535","fieldValue":" In a multirate wireless LAN, wireless\/mobile stations usually adapt their transmission rates to the channel condition. It is difficult to control each station's usage of network resources since the shared channel can be overused by low transmission-rate stations. To solve this problem, we propose a distributed control of stations' airtime usage which 1) always guarantees each station to receive a specified share of airtime, and 2) keeps service for individual stations unaffected by other stations' transmission rates. Such airtime control enables service differentiation or quality of service (QoS) support. Moreover, it can achieve a higher overall system throughput.The proposed airtime usage control exploits the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) of the IEEE 802.11e standard [1]. Two control mechanisms are proposed: one based on controlling the station's arbitration inter-frame space (AIFS) and the other based on the contention window size. We show how the stations' airtime usage is related to the AIFS and contention window size parameters. Using this relation, two analytical models are developed to determine the optimal control parameters. Unlike the other heuristic controls or analytical models, our model provides handles or parameters for quantitative control of stations' airtime usage. Our evaluation results show that a precise airtime usage control can be achieved in a multirate wireless LAN."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9535","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9535","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9535","fieldValue":"ACM"}
