However, pinpointing the site of performance degradation from end-to-end measurements is a challenging problem. In this paper, we show how end-to-end delay measurements of multicast traffic can be used to infer the under-lying logical multicast tree and the packet delay variance on each of its links. The method does not depend on cooperation from intervening network elements; multicast probing is bandwidth efficient. We establish desirable statistical properties of the estimator, namely consistency and asymptotic normality. We evaluate the approach through simulations, and analyze its failure modes and their probabilities."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9264","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9264","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9264","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9265","fieldValue":" Embedding of a graph metric in Euclidean space efficiently and accurately is an important problem in general with applications in topology aggregation, closest mirror selection, and application level routing. We propose a new graph embedding scheme called Big-Bang Simulation (BBS), which simulates an explosion of particles under a force field derived from embedding error. BBS is shown to be significantly more accurate compared to all other embedding methods, including GNP. We report an extensive simulation study of BBS compared with several known embedding schemes and show its advantage for distance estimation (as in the IDMaps project), mirror selection, and topology aggregation."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9265","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/9265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/9265","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/9266","fieldValue":" Today's HTTP carries Web interactions over client-initiated TCP connections. An important implication of using this transport method is that interception caches in the network violate the end-to-end principle of the Internet, which severely limits deployment options of these caches. Furthermore, while an increasing number of Web interactions are short, and in fact frequently carry only control information and no data, TCP is often inefficient for short interactions We propose a new transfer protocol for the Web, called Dual-Transport HTTP (DHTTP), which splits the traffic between UDP and TCP channels. When choosing the TCP channel, it is the server who opens the connection back to the client. Through server-initiated connections, DHTTP upholds the Internet end-to-end principle in the presence of interception caches, thereby allowing unrestricted caching within backbones. Moreover, the comparative performance study of DHTTP and HTTP using trace-driven simulation as well as testing real HTTP and DHTTP servers showed a significant performance advantage of DHTTP when the bottleneck is at the server and comparable performance when the bottleneck is in the network."}
