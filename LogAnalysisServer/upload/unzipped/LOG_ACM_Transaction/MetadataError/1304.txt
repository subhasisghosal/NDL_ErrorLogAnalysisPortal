When these tests are implemented using fixed precision arithmetic such as floating point, they can produce incorrect answers; when they are implemented using arbitrary-precision arithmetic, they are expensive to compute. We present adaptive-precision algorithms for finding the signs of determinants of matrices with integer and rational elements. These algorithms were developed and tested by integrating them into the Guibas-Stolfi Delaunay triangulation algorithm. Through a combination of algorithm design and careful engineering of the implementation, the resulting program can triangulate a set of random rational points in the unit circle only four to five times slower than can a floating-point implementation of the algorithm. The algorithms, engineering process, and software tools developed are described."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15056","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15056","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15057","fieldValue":" Cubic spline curves have many nice properties that make them desirable for use in comptuer graphics, and the advantages of antialiasing have been known for some years. Yet, only recently has there been any attempt at directly antialiasing spline curves. Parametric spline curves have resisted antialiasing in several ways: single segments may cross or become tangent to themselves. Cusps and small loops are easily missed entirely. Thus, short pieces of the curve cannot necessarily be rendered in isolation. Finding the distance from a pixel center to the curve accurately and efficientlyâ\u20AC\u201Dusually an essential part of antialiasingâ\u20AC\u201Dis an unsolved problem. The method presented by Lien, Shantz, and Pratt [21] is a good start, although it considers pixel-length pieces of the curve in isolation and lacks robustness in the handling of certain curves. This paper provides an improved method that is more robust, and is able to handle intersections and tangency."}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15057","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/15057","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/15058","fieldValue":" We derive a simple output-sensitive algorithm for hidden surfaceremoval in a collection of "}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15058","fieldValue":" We derive a simple output-sensitive algorithm for hidden surfaceremoval in a collection of "}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/15058","fieldValue":"ACM"}
