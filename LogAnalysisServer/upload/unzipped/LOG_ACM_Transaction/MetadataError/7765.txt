While this problem applies to many emerging applications, to keep our discussion concrete, we will focus on sensor networks used for structural health monitoring. Within this context, the heaviest computation is to determine the singular value decomposition (SVD) to extract mode shapes (eigenvectors) of a structure. Compared to collecting raw vibration data and performing SVD at a central location, computing SVD within the network can result in significantly lower energy consumption and delay. Using recent results on decomposing SVD, a well-known centralized operation, we seek to determine a near-optimal communication structure that enables the distribution of this computation and the reassembly of the final results, with the objective of minimizing energy consumption subject to a computational delay constraint. We show that this reduces to a generalized clustering problem and establish that it is NP-hard. By relaxing the delay constraint, we derive a lower bound. We then propose an integer linear program (ILP) to solve the constrained problem exactly as well as an approximate algorithm with a proven approximation ratio. We further present a distributed version of the approximate algorithm. We present both simulation and experimentation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10343","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10343","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10344","fieldValue":" Securing Voice over IP (VoIP) is a crucial requirement for its successful adoption. A key component of this is securing the signaling path, which is performed by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Securing SIP can be accomplished by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) instead of UDP as the transport protocol. However, using TLS for SIP is not yet widespread, perhaps due to concerns about the performance overhead. This paper studies the performance impact of using TLS as a transport protocol for SIP servers. We evaluate the cost of TLS experimentally using a testbed with OpenSIPS, OpenSSL, and Linux running on an Intel-based server. We analyze TLS costs using application, library, and kernel profiling and use the profiles to illustrate when and how different costs are incurred. We show that using TLS can reduce performance by up to a factor of 17 compared to the typical case of SIP-over-UDP. The primary factor in determining performance is whether and how TLS connection establishment is performed due to the heavy costs of RSA operations used for session negotiation. This depends both on how the SIP proxy is deployed and what TLS operation modes are used. The cost of symmetric key operations such as AES, in contrast, tends to be small. Network operators deploying SIP-over-TLS should attempt tomaximize the persistence of secure connections and will need to assess the server resources required. To aid them, we provide ameasurement-driven cost model for use in provisioning SIP servers using TLS. Our cost model predicts performance within 15% on average."}{"fieldName":"dc.identifier.other","informationCode":"ERR_NULL_VALUE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10344","fieldValue":"{\"eissn\":\"\"}"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_TEXT_LENGTH_SMALL","handle":"12345678_acm\/10344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.publisher","informationCode":"WARN_ALL_WORD_UPPER","handle":"12345678_acm\/10344","fieldValue":"ACM"}{"fieldName":"dc.contributor.author","informationCode":"WARN_INVALID_PERSON","handle":"12345678_acm\/10345","fieldValue":"Rokitansky, Carl-Herbert"}{"fieldName":"dc.description.abstract","informationCode":"ERR_SPACE_AT_EDGE","handle":"12345678_acm\/10345","fieldValue":" The Airborne Internet is a vision of a large-scale multihop wireless mesh network consisting of commercial passenger aircraft connected via long-range highly directional air-to-air radio links. We propose a geographic load sharing strategy to fully exploit the total air-to-ground capacity available at any given time. When forwarding packets for a given destination, a node considers not one but a set of next-hop candidates and spreads traffic among them based on queue dynamics. In addition, load balancing is performed among Internet Gateways by using a congestion-aware handover strategy. Our simulations using realistic North Atlantic air traffic demonstrate the ability of such a load sharing mechanism to approach the maximum theoretical throughput in the network."}
